# THE ROSARY

In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, AMEN.

## *THE APOSTLES CREED*

I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, Our Lord, who was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; He decended into the dead; on the third day, He rose again, He ascended into heaven and seated at the right hand of the Father Almighty. He will come again to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting, AMEN.

**LORD, GIVE US MORE FAITH, HOPE AND CHARITY**


    (1x) Our Father in heaven, holy by your name, your kingdom, your will be done, on earth as in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sinned against us; do not bring us to the test, but deliver us from evil, AMEN.

    (3x) Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you, blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, AMEN.

    (1x) Glory be to the Father, to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now ever shall be world without end, AMEN.

# FAREWELL TO OUR LADY
### *(to be recited on the last day of visit)*

Our Lady of Fatima and Immaculate Mother of God, before leaving our humble dwelling, we desire to express the pain and sorrow that fill our souls at seeing you depart from our midst.   
Thanks O Mother, for having remained among us, your humble and devoted children.   
Thank you for the benefits, with which no merit on our partyou have granted on us.   
Do not forget that in this house, there are hearts that love you and are eager for the moment of receiving you anew in our midst.  
Forgive and excusee us, Most Merciful Mother, if we did not know how to honor you as due and for not having profited enough from the visit through our frailty and ignorance.  
Mother, never forget us in time or in eternity and we hope from your unlimited bounty  that in the same way as we willingly have opened our doors to welcome you in our home, you may also one day open for us the gates of heaven, AMEN.

**OUR LADY OF FATIMA, PRAY FOR US**
