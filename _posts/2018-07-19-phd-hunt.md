## day 9 

Monette helped me out by choosing the 6 out of 11 schools in Australia where she'd like to stay close to. From there I was able to come up with my top 3 places for this PhD to happen. 

Here it is in order of preference:
1. University of Melbourne 
2. Newcastle University (Sydney)
3. University of Wollongong (Sydney)

Next would be to go deeper in their offerings and actually start emailing perspective advisers. 

I'm excited!
