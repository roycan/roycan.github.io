## day 7

I'm still in the process of reading about different Australian University PhD offerings related to End-User Development. 

Feeling a bit tired, but then again, it's Friday and I did stay up late last night slowly doing a report I just passed for the Cash Office project. I'm grateful. I feel the guidance. At the same time I feel the weaknesses. I feel the power of habit and the energy the some how feeds to the attainment of the comfort provided by the exercise of habits. Nasanay na kung baga. It's like an analog to my gastronomic love for rice. When I feel weak, I'd like to have good habits to tide me through. I think the way to do that is to exercise good habits as much as I can... such as sitting down and doing something for research in the morning.  :D

Ok, so lets have the loop for this OZ PhD search:
1. go to the school's website
2. look for a PhD program on EUD, SE, IS or HCL
3. look for a prof working on what you want to work on.

# *University of Technology Sydney*


## Open Scholarshipt Opportunity
Risk:
I might forever lose the dream of Inclusive Programming for Information Systems depending on the ideas of the research supervisor 

Opportunity: 
There's a scholarship offering here that does initial software creation for bacterial outbreaks. 

Advantages:
Sydney familiarity. Close to family. 

Disadvantages:
The project's topic isn't exactly what I want, though what I want to do may be useful for the funded research project.
