## day 3



### Queensland University of Technology

This is a prime candidate!

### Western Sydney University

I have another prime target! 

* https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/scem/school_of_computing_engineering_and_mathematics/research

This is super prime because I found a paper that I actually want to extend and expand to include our local context.

### Example Project overview and Proposal

I definitely need to write about what I want to do. This is a very good template that will help me quickly draft my proposal executive summary.

### Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia

This is a powerful place for the software engineering I like to do. I didn't see UED, but I had spent little time looking 

W: it's in Malaysia
S: it has agile and soft dev research that I understand


## Summary

* I found the **Western Sydney University** as my current top pick.  :)
* My second pick is the **Queensland University of Technology**
* I think I better create a project proposal for this research project. I got a template! :)
