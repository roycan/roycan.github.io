## day 8

I finally got around scanning the good universities of Australia for a Computer Science PhD program. These are the last of my notes for the first pass. 

I think any one of them will be great to get into. Next will be to rank them in terms of happy life priority and then start applying. 



# Australian National University

This looks like a fun university based on the website.
