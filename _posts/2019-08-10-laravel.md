I'm in CBTL with Monette and she shows me an awesome thing. Her Prof has powerpoint slides that read the notes automatically. I was thinking, how do I achieve this with Google Slides.

1. record audio. I think this can be done on a per slide basis. 
2. convert audio to video. Use audacity or ffmpeg. Google slides can embed video, not audio.
3. upload to google drive. youtube will work too, but you'll have ads. 
4. share the video as a presentation. well, the video has got to be shared.
5. embed the video to the right slide. manage the size and drag past the slide borders so that it doesn't show.
6. set to autoplay. you can fix up the timing also. 
7. test that everything works

This can be for the instructional materials that I'll be authoring. Any updates can be done piecemeal.
