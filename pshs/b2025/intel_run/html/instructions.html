  <h1>What to Do</h1>
	<h3>You are a spy, and you need to get some intel! You have to solve different types of puzzles to go through different rooms. Your goal is to pass through all of the needed rooms in order to get the briefcase with important information. Make your colleagues proud for the greater good!</h3>
  <h3>To input the answers to puzzles, you will have to answer the form given for each room. You'll be given certain formats to mark your answer correct, and you'll be alerted if your answer is incorrect.</h3>
	<h3>Once you've completed the game, you'll see your scores. Each room has a score of a multiple of ten. If there is an incorrect attempt, five points will be deducted. Make sure to double-check if you're right, or else you will fail your mission.</h3>
	<h2>Now if you're ready, let's first proceed to design your character!</h2>
