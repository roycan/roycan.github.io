This is going for what I want. Then I will go through my \nweak-ties\n and see where that brings me. Of course I will be nice and courteous and helpful to others when I can.  :) \n\n\nPlan A would be to apply somewhere with a grind schedule and just stick with the program. Applying myself to what the boss or supervisor says. I rejected it because it didn't have the growth environment that I wanted. \n\n\nPlan B was to stick to UP. That is now out of the question, due to the choices I made to pursue things that were more important to me and the environment of confusion that I was in with regard to publishing papers in a topic that I didn't feel for. I like the technique. But there weren't support for that in the scale that I needed. I loved the environment though.\n\n\nPlan C, for Canseco.... :D\nPlan is going for what I really want. I might not know how to get there right now. That's fine. I know what I want, what I love, what I feel passionate about. The Lord is giving me ideas for heaven as to what I could do about it. At every corner, I am being questioned if I really want it. I do really want it. I am it. I resonate purpose with it.

They really depend on people, but at the same time they are very dedicated to them too. They choose to proactively with their wishes when they communicate. They do this through\n\n\n\n\nBeing dependent on and dedicated to People\n\n\nBeing Proactively Transparent\n with their intensions\n\n\n\n\nSelf-made Billionaires seem to be efficient and focused when dealing with the world around them. They do this through\n\n\n\n\nRelying on Communication Systems with Push Communications\n for making sure that messages are clear among parties and information gets to them in a timely manner. \n\n\nBeing intentional with what I consume\n , whether it's TV, radio, print and conversation. \n\n\nDeciding based on Data and Narrative\n \n\n\n\n\nI can take lessons from this and etch it in my body. Whenever I undertake something, I make sure to be simple and clear as to what I want from it. I make plans that are easy to communicate, remember and used. I make clear on what results are acceptable too. I will use user stories and definitions of done.\n\n\nWhenever I communicate with others, I appreciate what they do for me and make sure they understand that I am interested in them and their success as much as I appreciate them. I iterate and reiterate my intentions and principles in a manner much like that of tending a garden I love.\n\n\nWhen I interact with the world, I choose to take in what helps. Same with my body.

Self-made Billionaires seem to treat others in a special way too. They really depend on people, but at the same time they are very dedicated to them too. They choose to proactively with their wishes when they communicate. They do this through   Being dependent on and dedicated to People  Being Proactively Transparent  with their intensions   Self-made Billionaires seem to be efficient and focused when dealing with the world around them. They do this through   Relying on Communication Systems with Push Communications  for making sure that messages are clear among parties and information gets to them in a timely manner.   Being intentional with what I consume  , whether it's TV, radio, print and conversation.   Deciding based on Data and Narrative     I can take lessons from this and etch it in my body. Whenever I undertake something, I make sure to be simple and clear as to what I want from it. I make plans that are easy to communicate, remember and used. I make clear on what results are acceptable too. I will use user stories and definitions of done.  Whenever I communicate with others, I appreciate what they do for me and make sure they understand that I am interested in them and their success as much as I appreciate them. I iterate and reiterate my intentions and principles in a manner much like that of tending a garden I love.  When I interact with the world, I choose to take in what helps. Same with my body.

Each team will have at most five (5) members. These teams will work on the\nSA&D deliverables, group assignments and in completing all the other requirements of the course.\n\n\nAttendance\n\n\nThe class shall observe the University rules on attendance. This applies to sessions where physical presence is\nrequired. Four (4) absences (excused/unexcused) are allowed all throughout the duration of the course. A student\nwho exceeds this maximum allowable absences shall be dropped from the class roll. The Instructor shall check\nthe attendance from time to time and this shall be done on a random basis.\n\n\nSubmission of Requirements\n\n\nStudents are expected to demonstrate utmost diligence in the submission of course requirements. For every day\nof delay (includes weekends and holidays), five (5) points shall be deducted from the overall score awarded to any\nwork/task. Time management should be observed by students so as to ensure prompt and quality submission of\nthe course requirements.\n\n\nCode of Ethics\n\n\nThe highest level of ethical standards must be observed by each and every class member. Being admitted into the\nprogram is an accomplishment that should not be tarnished with any pigment of fraud, deceit and distrust. The\ncourse will be delivered under the clear cloud of mutual trust and respect.\n\n\nPeer Evaluation\n\n\nEach member of the team will accomplish an online evaluation form at the end of the course. This evaluation form\nwill capture each member\u2019s assessment of the performance of his/her team members. A rating of 1 shall be given\nto team members whose performance is Very Poor, 3 for Average performance and 5 for those who have\nExcellent performance. For each missing point, two (2) points shall be deducted from the team score and the\nstudent shall receive the resulting score (Illustration: if team score is 90 and peer evaluation rating of student A is 3,\nstudent A will receive a score of 86). Thus, it is important that the peer evaluation will be done with utmost care\nand consideration of what really was delivered and performed by each member of the team.\n\n\nGroup Tasks/Assignments\n\n\nThe course will require groups/teams to work on various tasks and assignments. These group tasks/assignments\nshall be assigned to the teams at a particular time and submission deadlines shall be specified by the Instructor for each of the tasks/assignments. Papers related to the this team work must be uploaded into the LMS. The\nevaluation of papers will follow these metrics:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRUBRIC\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganization and Logic\n\n\n30%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth of Analysis\n\n\n40%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentation/Delivery of Ideas\n\n\n20%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall Impact of Paper\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Policies\n\n\n\n\nComplaints regarding exam results shall be entertained only within a period of one week after the examination\npapers are returned. No complaints shall be entertained after this period. Students must use a pen or ballpen\nwhen taking any examination, otherwise, no complaints whatsoever regarding the examination shall be\naccepted.\n\n\nThe specific guidelines that shall govern the other course requirements (team presentations and deliverables)\nshall be announced in the class prior to the implementation of said course requirements. Each day of delay\n(including Saturdays and Sundays) shall be penalized by deducting 5 points from whatever score earned by a\nstudent/team for a specific requirement.\n\n\nStudents who will get an average score of 60% or higher shall be exempted from taking the Final Exam. A\nstudent who will miss one of the exams (i.e. midterm or pre-final) shall receive 80% of the score of the other\nexam taken by the student. If he/she will miss both exams, the student will take a Completion Exam and the\nFinal Exam (Thursday, Oct 10). Those who will take the Completion and Final Exam must expect a set of more\ndifficult questions.\n\n\nTeams are expected to submit ALL deliverables. If one item is missing, all team members shall automatically\nreceive a grade of INC. For completing said requirements, item #3 above shall be applied in the computation\nof scores.\n\n\n\n\nCOURSE REFERENCES\n\n\n\n\nModern Systems Analysis and Design, 6th edition. Jeffrey A.

The first would be the implementing technical team that would be composed of the developers, testers and analysts who will implement the software system. The second group would be the IC I.T. team who would be in charge of hosting and deploying the system. Lastly, this document is also for the I.S. team tasked in software support, enhancement and maintenance.  \n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nThe Insurance Commission (IC) desires to have data-driven information system software that is accessible to everyone in need of the data parked there.\n\n\nThe IC desires to have their system equipped with a high level of maintainability. It also requires a high flexibility in adding functionality.\n\n\nIC desires the ability to integrate current stand-alone web applications as well as future developments with respect to data exchange and secure access.\n\n\nThis document describes a design for a Web Application (Web App) that aligns to the desires of IC in realizing an information system that will support them as IC moves to whole new level of public service.\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\nThroughout the interview stage of the project, I have assessed several needs and opportunities that drive design. Listed here are points of note and how I believe we can use them as guidance for the development stage.\n\n\nThe current development man-power of IC is not so large. It will then benefit enormously from having the ability to split roles in project among in-house and third-party developers. The MVC architecture has good role-splitting  mechanism (e.g. frontend views, backend controller).\n\n\nThe information system needs of IC is large. It will force the files to be split into many logical directories. Since no single developer can claim his logic is better than all the rest, we recommend following a framework so that all system developers, current or future, will know where each type of file will be found. The Laravel framework has a good directory structure, which is similar to other popular frameworks such as Rails.\n\n\nPolicy changes seem to be a fairly regular occurence in IC. It would be great if End-Users confident that particular link will give them what they need and failing that, will return empty and not give them anything else that may cause confusion. It would be great if End-users are confident that new features will mean new links and would simply expect those to be available in response to policy. These benefits are part of implementing a RESTful architecture pattern through the uniform interface constraint.\n\n\nThere would be two (2) main environments for system usage. The first is within the IC for data access needs in support of analysis and reportorial requirements. The second environment in insurance companies, as a means to submit data and obtain feedback from IC.\n\n\nThe users for the first environment are IC staff for data access and report generation and IC heads for report consumption. The users for the second environement are the insurance company staff to prepare and update requirements as draft submissions and the insurance company head to authorize submissions.\n\n\nThe system is for having a central repository of files and data for IC interaction with insurance companies.\n\n\nThe main functions are secure login to a centralized data-driven web application that allows access to resources depending on the user rights of their IC staff or insurance company staff. Part of the resources are soft copies of the submissions to IC (i.e requests, schedules and reports).\n\n\nThe main interfaces are a insurance company interface and an IC interface per division. The main inputs to the system are the various required from insurance companies. The main outputs of the system are support for the reports that IC generates.\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\nThe relevant architectures used in this design are\n\n\n\n\nModel-View-Controller (MVC)\n\n\nRepresentational State Transfer (REST)\n\n\nActive Record Architectural Pattern\n\n\n\n\nThese software architecture patterns are compatible with each other when the development is done in a certain way, which are described more throughout this document.\n\n\nI recommend one of the following actions to better ensure that the overall architecture is followed, that key patterns implemented consistent with each other and the benefits on reliability, scalability, security and maintainability are achieved for IC.\n\n\nPlease choose 1:\n1. Get the same team who designed to develop the system\n2. Get at least part of the design team to be part of the development team\n3. Take a software architect from the design team as design consultant in the development phase and resolve each development obstacle in keeping with the principles of the architecture\n4. Make sure that a software architect, who understands the design, guides the development and inspects if the architectural constraints in the design document are observed.\n\n\nThis is like in making a building. Every great and large building has an architect all the way from its start to the end.\n\n\nThe basic architecture will look like this:\n\n\n\n![MVC]({{ \"/assets/mvc.png\" | absolute_url }})\n(https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-the-basics-of-ruby-on-rails-http-mvc-and-routes-359b8d809c7a)\n\n\nModel-View-Controller\n\n\nAll requests from clients to the server will be brought to the controller to be preprocessed and routed to the proper action. The controller will direct the actions to the Model when database access is necessary and direct it to the Views when the data requirements are satisfied.\n\n\nEvery service that the server provides are in terms of actions/ methods for a particular Controller. The default means of output or feedback is through Views that correspond to the actions in the Controller. These controllers may have corresponding Models if they have need to access the database. The Models contain the relationship among the tables in the database. They provide access to database table rows as class instances. The provide access to the fields of a table as object properties.\n\n\nIn this manner, it would be possible to change the underlying relational database management system without altering the base code. The clients can also change web browsers or web-browsing devices without affecting the services rendered by the system.\n\n\nI agree with the advantages of using MySQL or MariaDB initially to maximize compatibility with most of the databases used in IC. I recommend that  Aurora MySQL RDMS be used when moving operations into the cloud. I also recommend a migration to the PostgreSQL database at some point prior to developing the part of workflow automation where a lot of computation will be necessary. MySQL is best for text heavy databases such as blogs and websites. PostgreSQL tends to excel more for Information Systems (IS).\n\n\nMVC allows a degree of separation between the front end of the system and its backend. This will be especially be useful when aesthetics and usability improvements are desired while making sure that the underlying data and logic are kept safe during the implementation of the changes.\n\n\nWe recommend the MVC framework Laravel for the purpose of IC, where there are I.S. division already has skills in the underlying technologies of the framework and will find it easy to adapt. I recommend switching all development to a framework as soon as possible to make all the resulting systems more scalable, maintainable and future-proof.\n\n\nREST Pattern\n\n\nImplementing the web application using the framework of Representational State Transfer maximizes scalability of multi-developer multi-group contribution and access. It makes the system resilient with respect to changes in the services requested by the Clients , while having the Server keep assumptions about Clients at a minimum.\n\n\nThe REST pattern allows expansion in complexity through adding layers between the Client and the Server with each layer only interacting with the one immediately above or below it. This makes it easier for the system to work with proxy servers and network gateways.\n\n\nThe REST patterns imposes some other important constraints such as being stateless and having a uniform interface. Using Laravel's resource controller route allows automatically generated and thus, uniform interfaces, so that other developers can safely and easily request for server resources. This will allow multiple IC or non-IC developers to work on a single project together. This will also allow future developers to continue the work of former developers that may have left the service of IC.\n\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that all requests must be sending a representation of what is required and not commands to the server. The server will still have the ability to ignore or serve the request. Also, the server can send hypermedia, or invitations to access other services or resources from the server. The server provide or push any unrequested service to the Client. What this will do for the UP-IC FEDS is to allow safe addition and removal of features during run time. New or enhanced features will not interfere with current usage without the explicit request for their use. Also, when old features are retired, the server can safely catch any request towards those features and handle them appropriately since the Client cannot directly command the Server.\n\n\nActive Record Architectural Pattern\n\n\nWe recommend that the Active Record Pattern be used as the approach for accessing database data in IC.\n\n\nIn this pattern, each Table of View is mapped into a class. Each instance of the class gets mapped into a row of the Table. There is automatic syncing. New ORM objects are saved in the database. Existing objects are loaded from the database. Changes to object properties are reflected as updates to the database. Finally, when objects are deleted, corresponding rows in the database are destroyed.\n\n\nObjects have methods for Insert, Update and Delete. Calls to object properties give the data. Foreign key relationships for joined Tables are used by having one object accessed through a property of another object.\n\n\nBy using Laravel's ORM Model and not directly accessing the database through SQL statements, the Active Record Architecture can be enforced. IC will then have the ability to easily move to other databases in the future such as PostgreSQL and even other proprietary database management systems.\n\n\nUsing this architecture pattern also has other benefits such as enforcing constraints in linked data deletion, protecting your dependent data against accidental deletion.\n\n\nProcess and Workflow\n\n\nThe processes per Division with their corresponding designs are listed separately. Please proceed to that section to see descriptions of the designs that adhere to the architecture stated herein.  \n\n\nCommon workflows among processes include User Administration, Data Monitoring and Transaction Audit. Specific processes have dataflow diagrams.\n\n\nEnvironment and Network\n\n\nThe following Environment diagram can be supported by the Heroku PAAS on top of the AWS cloud service. This is what I recommend for the next phase of development.\n\n\nThe current on-premise servers in IC also capable of hosting the servers according to the diagram.\n\n\ndigraph G{\n\n    node[shape=box]\n    edge[dir=both]\n\n\n  \"Production Server\" -> \"Database Server\";\n  \"Clients\" -> \"Production Server\";\n\n\n  \"Pre-Production Server\" -> \"Mirrored Database\";\n  \"Change Manager\" -> \"Pre-Production Server\";\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe software is recommended to be initially cloud developed with the choice of moving on-premise after development. This will allow maximum flexibility in efficient adding of security and reliability to the system during development that can more-readily be translated to on-premise at a future point.  \n\n\nDevelopment and Testing will be done on local machines and not on the server.\n\n\nDeployment View\n\n\nI suggest to use a Platform as a Service (PAAS) for the first deployment of the system. This is a middle layer to Cloud Infrastructure.\n\n\nSpecifically, I suggest using Heroku PAAS that is built on top of the AWS cloud. I find this as a best-practice intermediate step going to a direct cloud Infrastructure as a Service.\n\n\nFor file storage, we recommend the AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) for the security and reliability it provides. It also has a stable and well developed API for use with the recommended framework.\n\n\nBy doing the above, we will be able to capture, real-time bandwidth, redundancy and security requirements for the system that will guide any future deployment and expansion.\n\n\nShould on-premise deployment be pursued:\nThe services are provided by the local server. The server, whether on-premise will be provisioned and maintained with standard performance parameters of within ~70 percent of average capacity for bandwidth, memory and processing. The clients will be nodes within the network with applicable access rights. The server actions in response to logged client requests.\n\n\nImplementation View\n\n\nWe recommend a Git-based source code version control. Examples of which are Gitlab, Bitbucket and Github. This can be hosted by IC once a stable version 1.0 of the system is released. For initial development, the code is recommended to be stored in a private cloud-based repository.\n\n\nWe recommend month-long agile sprints as a development methodology for implementing this design over a 9-12 month period.\n\n\nData Management\n\n\nData conversion and migration would be through Excel or similar spreadsheets and SQL databases. Archiving data will be through database backups and secure cloud-based storage.\n\n\nSecurity Authentication Authorization and Audit\n\n\nAuthentication would be through login accounts set per division or per insurance company access rights.\n\n\nAuthorization would on the company side, would rely on the account given to the company head. Authorization on the IC side may be designated to each Division Head for each division. Deputy Commissioners would have authority over all their divisions.\n\n\nAll actions will be logged by the system. For actions that impact the database, the logs will include enough data to reverse the change being done.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nMartin Fowler. 2003. Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture.

Listed here are points of note and how I believe we can use them as guidance for the development stage.  The current development man-power of IC is not so large. It will then benefit enormously from having the ability to split roles in project among in-house and third-party developers. The MVC architecture has good role-splitting  mechanism (e.g. frontend views, backend controller).  The information system needs of IC is large. It will force the files to be split into many logical directories. Since no single developer can claim his logic is better than all the rest, we recommend following a framework so that all system developers, current or future, will know where each type of file will be found. The Laravel framework has a good directory structure, which is similar to other popular frameworks such as Rails.  Policy changes seem to be a fairly regular occurence in IC. It would be great if End-Users confident that particular link will give them what they need and failing that, will return empty and not give them anything else that may cause confusion. It would be great if End-users are confident that new features will mean new links and would simply expect those to be available in response to policy. These benefits are part of implementing a RESTful architecture pattern through the uniform interface constraint.  There would be two (2) main environments for system usage.
