<p><font color="#000000">The setup was small-scale since it was developed initially to support iGovPhil-developed applications and other services including the Government Mail (GovMail). However, as more agencies came to know about GovCloud, the Cloud IaaS was later offered to other government agencies in need of cloud computing.</font></p>
