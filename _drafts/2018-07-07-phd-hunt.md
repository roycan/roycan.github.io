# my PhD hunt

## day 1

I'll be looking for my PhD abroad. 
I now am confident in what I can offer and do. 
I believe in the Lord and I know he has plans for me.
Kaya namin ni Lord 'to. 
I am learning new skills too. 
My decision to go Software Engineering has tuned my senses to the various ways that I am to manage software development. I know I'm learning important things from being with everyone.

That said, by preparing somethings from my end, I'll be able to take the most advantage of the opportunities before me. Also, by taking care of my body, I'll be able to perform at my peak. I've seen the faculty at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. They look fit. It is possible. It is possible for me too. 

Right now, I'm doing a meeting with the Lord. Ako na sa minutes... hehehe.  We're looking for the Universities and Professors to get in touch with.

1. filter universities
2. rank universities
3. send informal inquiries
4. send formal application
5. packup and go

To this end, I plan to populate a gdoc that I can share to family and friends as I go through this journey.



## day 2

I think I'm done looking at the aggregated PhD scholarships for Computer Science. Only 1 seriously popped up for me. *University of Technology Sidney* (UTS).

What do I need to send an email?
* updated CV
* key questions
    * international applications
    * funding eligibility
* *plan of research

Note on the plan of research. This is going for what I want. Then I will go through my weak-ties and see where that brings me. Ofcourse I will be nice and courteous and helpful to others when I can.  :) 

Plan A would be to apply somewhere with a grind schedule and just stick with the program. Applying myself to what the boss or supervisor says. I rejected it because it didn't have the growth environment that I wanted. 

Plan B was to stick to UP. That is now out of the question, due to the choices I made to pursue things that were more important to me and the environment of confusion that I was in with regard to publishing papers in a topic that I didn't feel for. I like the technique. But there weren't support for that in the scale that I needed. I loved the environment though.

Plan C, for Canseco.... :D
Plan is going for what I really want. I might not know how to get there right now. That's fine. I know what I want, what I love, what I feel passionate about. The Lord is giving me ideas for heaven as to what I could do about it. At every corner, I am being questioned if I really want it. I do really want it. I am it. I resonate purpose with it. I live more strongly doing it. 


### Classification
* Sw-engineering
* Programming Languages
* Human-computer Interaction
* Empirical Studies
### Keywords
* End-user software engineering
* End-user programming


There are two basic **reasons** why EUD has become popular.
1.  One is because organizations are facing delays on projects and using EUD can effectively cut the time of completion on a project. 
2. The second reason is that software tools are more powerful and easier to use.

Lessons learned from EUD solutions can significantly influence 
* the software life cycles for commercial software products, 
* in-house intranet/extranet developments and 
* enterprise application deployments.


## London PhD Opportunity
There's an opportunity for a PhD in Machine Learning for Automated Software Engineering in London, **Queen Mary University of London**, School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science. 

I think I can do this. But it's a B goal, not a C goal. I don't see how mastering it helps my country after. It's cool, but I don't feel passion for it.

There's a better place in London: **University of Cambridge**. The Department of Computer Science and Technology there is part of the EUSES Consortium. 




## Target advisers:

* [Margaret Burnett](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/people/burnett-margaret)
* [Christopher Scaffidi](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/people/scaffidi-christopher)

However they are from the US and I am trying to avoid the US at the moment.

I have been looking at other possible advisers. The weakness is that their Universities are actually lower in rank than UP. However, I am quite confident that their software engineering lab is stronger than UPD's currently. hehehe



## day 3

### Edith Cowan University

[Edith Cowan University](http://www.ecu.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/12677/ECU-PG-Directions.pdf)

[ECU ranking](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/edith-cowan-university)

W: lower than UP QS;  no end-user dev research


### Queensland University of Technology

This is a prime candidate!  

* https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/queensland-university-technology-qut
* https://www.qut.edu.au/science-engineering/our-schools/school-of-information-systems/service-science
* https://www.qut.edu.au/science-engineering/our-schools/school-of-information-systems/information-science
* https://www.qut.edu.au/science-engineering/our-schools/school-of-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/computer-human-interaction


### Western Sydney University

I have another prime target! 

* https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/scem/school_of_computing_engineering_and_mathematics/research

This is super prime because I found a paper that I actually want to extend and expand to include our local context.

* https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.engglib.upd.edu.ph/content/pdf/10.1007%2F11531371_62.pdf


### Example Project overview and Proposal

I definitely need to write about what I want to do. This is a very good template that will help me quickly draft my proposal executive summary.

### Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia

This is a powerful place for the software engineering I like to do. I didn't see UED, but I had spent little time looking 

W: it's in Malaysia
S: it has agile and soft dev research that I understand
