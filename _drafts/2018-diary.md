## July 24

I'm glad that I'm able to separate myself a bit from the IC work today. I pray for my IC team, I trust that they'll do their work today well. I will inspect tomorrow. 

3 big priorities:
1. research - cv
2. work - PDS
3. self dev - cloud review

## PDS
1. answer what can easily be answered
2. send right away 
3. have Fr lem

## CV
1. consolidate. 
    1. camscanner -> gdrive
    2. notebloc -> gdrive
    3. keep -> gdrive
2. Take certificate pics using notebloc
3. Back up Noteblocs and send pdfs to gdrive

## Cloud Review 
1. consolidate the training materials
2. run through the lessons
3. run through the labs

**take the mock exam on Thursday**

[The 10 Principles of Self-Made Billionaires](https://www.success.com/the-10-principles-of-self-made-billionaires/?utm_term=inside&utm_source=Maropost&utm_campaign=Inside&utm_medium=email&mpweb=574-7261074-742150499
) 

1. Simplicity of Purpose
2. Simplicity of Plan
3. Limit what you tolerate
4. Absolute reliance on people
5. Absolute dedication to people
6. Rely on Communication Systems
7. Require Push Communications
8. Intentional with what you consume
9. Make Decisions based on Data *and* Narrative
10. Be proactively transparent


Combining 1 and 2:
  Simplify both Purpose and Plan

  Limit what you tolerate

Combine 4 and 5:
  Absolute dependence on and dedication to People

  Be Proactively Transparent

Combine 6 and 7:
  Rely on Communications Systems with Push Communications

  Intentional with what you consume

  Make Decisions based on both Data *and* Narrative


From Bryan Treacy's book (thank you Rap), I see that Leaders have Priorities and most of the time can be found executing on their priorities. They have no excuses. 

From the medium article, I'm seeing humanities' self-made Billionaires seem to treat themselves to **Clarity and Discipline** through 

1. **Simplifying Purpose and Plans** for whatever they're working on
2. **Limiting what they Tolerate** in things, others and especially themselves.

Self-made Billionaires seem to treat others in a special way too. They really depend on people, but at the same time they are very dedicated to them too. They choose to proactively with their wishes when they communicate. They do this through

3. **Being dependent on and dedicated to People**
4. **Being Proactively Transparent** with their intensions

Self-made Billionaires seem to be efficient and focused when dealing with the world around them. They do this through

5. **Relying on Communication Systems with Push Communications** for making sure that messages are clear among parties and information gets to me in a timely manner. 
6. **Being intentional with what I consume** , whether it's TV, radio, print and conversation. 
7. **Deciding based on Data and Narrative** 


I can take lessons from this and etch it in my body. Whenever I undertake something, I make sure to be simple and clear as to what I want from it. I make plans that are easy to communicate, remember and used. I make clear on what results are acceptable too. I will use user stories and definitions of done.

Whenever I communicate with others, I appreciate what they do for me and make sure they understand that I am interested in them and their success as much as I appreciate them. I iterate and reiterate my intentions and principles in a manner much like that of tending a garden I love.

When I interact with the world, I choose to take in what helps. Same with my body. I setup communication systems so that information flows with minimal friction. I open push communications so that important news come in as fast as possible too. When I decide, it will be on the basis the hard numbers and the stories that back it up. When both are reconciled, then a decision is to be made fast.

## September 14

I'm in CBTL with Monette and she shows me an awesome thing. Her Prof has powerpoint slides that read the notes automatically. I was thinking, how do I achieve this with Google Slides.

1. record audio. I think this can be done on a per slide basis. 
2. convert audio to video. Use audacity or ffmpeg. Google slides can embed video, not audio.
3. upload to google drive. youtube will work too, but you'll have ads. 
4. share the video as a presentation. well, the video has got to be shared.
5. embed the video to the right slide. manage the size and drag past the slide borders so that it doesn't show.
6. set to autoplay. you can fix up the timing also. 
7. test that everything works

This can be for the instructional materials that I'll be authoring. Any updates can be done piece-meal.

# OVCAIS vision

I know what to do. Let's see the vision for HRDO

The end goal is to have them in an upward spiral of technical savvyness with very stable and strong foundations. 

The is state has a web application with proper tests and is setup for continuous integration. It uses up to date security through a stable web framework. 

Functionality is then added safely through a efficient design generation process.

Development is conducted through an engaging atmosphere of mutual development.

As a developer, I do not want to hold the prerequisite knowledge of the intricacies of the system that I am developing, chances are, I may not be able to grasp it within an acceptable amount of time anyway. I'll have end-users (EU) and subject area experts (SME) for that. 

My job then is to 
1. roll out the design generation process
1. bring the development process up to a stage that I am certain
2. teach EU/SME enough programming to communicate clearly the processes that they are certain
3. merge the Dev and EU output in visual manner
4. use and refine
5. teach maintenance and move on
