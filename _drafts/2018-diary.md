## July 24

I'm glad that I'm able to separate myself a bit from the IC work today. I pray for my IC team, I trust that they'll do their work today well. I will inspect tomorrow. 

3 big priorities:
1. research - cv
2. work - PDS
3. self dev - cloud review

## PDS
1. answer what can easily be answered
2. send right away 
3. have Fr lem

## CV
1. consolidate. 
    1. camscanner -> gdrive
    2. notebloc -> gdrive
    3. keep -> gdrive
2. Take certificate pics using notebloc
3. Back up Noteblocs and send pdfs to gdrive

## Cloud Review 
1. consolidate the training materials
2. run through the lessons
3. run through the labs

**take the mock exam on Thursday**
