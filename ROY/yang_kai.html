<h2>Chapter 1732, Unexpected Attack</h2>
<p>Ten days later, inside the original ruins, there was now a cluster of newly built houses. Because this would be a long-term camp, the disciples of the two great forces had spared no effort in their construction.</p>
<p>These houses were not exquisite in design, but they were extremely practical. Living in them would be just like living in their respective Sects, except for the lacking of World Energy.</p>
<p>However, this was not a big problem. If one really wanted to cultivate, they simply needed to rely on Saint Crystals.</p>
<p>Along the roads of the former ruin, light stones were hung at regular intervals to provide a soft illumination, brightening up the originally dark and dreary space.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had informed Qian Tong and Ye Xi Yun about the locations of the eight mineral lodes he had already found; as for how they were mined, Yang Kai did not need to concern himself. Qian Tong and Ye Xi Yun would take charge of everything.</p>
<p>If they needed more manpower, they could always bring people over from Shadowed Star at any time; Yang Kai had arranged everything for them.</p>
<p>Not only that, once everything in the camp was in order and the disciples began mining operations, Yang Kai went out alone, and within a ten-million-kilometre radius, he arranged several Space Arrays!</p>
<p>Over the next several dozen years, these Space Arrays arranged by Yang Kai would allow the cultivators from Shadowed Star to move about easily within this range.</p>
<p>One month later, Yang Kai was ready to leave.</p>
<p>After all, his original intention was to open up a connection between Shadowed Star and the outside world; finding this Ore Star was just an inadvertent harvest.</p>
<p>Now that things were settled on this Ore Star, there was not any reason for Yang Kai to delay his trip further.</p>
<p>Standing amidst the ruins, Yang Kai summoned Xiao Xiao back!</p>
<p>Since arriving on this Ore Star, Yang Kai had never taken Xiao Xiao back, because this place was a paradise for him. By devouring all kinds of rare ores, Xiao Xiao could strengthen himself, and if there was enough of a particular type of ore, Xiao Xiao might even be able to acquire new abilities related to their properties.</p>
<p>His lava armour was a perfect example!</p>
<p>This was an ability Xiao Xiao gained after refining some of the Sun’s True Fire.</p>
<p>As soon he donned his lava armour, no one could approach to within ten metres of Xiao Xiao, as the heat he gave off was enough to force even Origin Realm masters back.</p>
<p>In any case, the resources on this Ore Star were extremely abundant, so no matter how much Xiao Xiao swallowed, the overall amount would not decrease. As such, Yang Kai had left Xiao Xiao to his own devices.</p>
<p>However, when he tried summoning Xiao Xiao, Yang Kai discovered that Xiao Xiao had dug extremely deep into the star, apparently having found something good.</p>
<p>Perceiving Yang Kai’s call, Xiao Xiao began tunnelling his way back up from below.</p>
<p>An hour later, Xiao Xiao appeared in front of Yang Kai.</p>
<p>But with just a glance, Yang Kai could not help becoming worried.</p>
<p>Because Xiao Xiao’s current state seemed somewhat improper.</p>
<p>Xiao Xiao had always appeared a bit gruff and silly because his sentience simply was not very high, a trait that was reflected by his somewhat dull outward appearance. However, at this moment, he appeared even dimmer than before, with the intelligent glint in his eyes now severely diminished.</p>
<p>When he walked about, Xiao Xiao staggered and swayed, as if he was drunk.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was taken aback and instinctually thought that Xiao Xiao had swallowed something he should not have, causing some kind of accident. But after performing a thorough check, Yang Kai was surprised to find that nothing was wrong with Xiao Xiao. In fact, his physical condition had never been better.</p>
<p>Additionally… Yang Kai sensed a strange, mysterious power coming from Xiao Xiao’s body.</p>
<p>This kind of power was familiar to Yang Kai as it was like the World Principles he felt as he refined the Star Source of Shadowed Star to become its Star Master.</p>
<p>“World Principles?” Yang Kai’s complexion changed drastically as he quickly began investigating more carefully.</p>
<p>After a long, silent probe, Yang Kai took back his Divine Sense and knitted his brow.</p>
<p>He did not feel anything was wrong with Xiao Xiao, but it was also undeniable that he now gave off a trace of World Principles from his body. This fluctuation was quite faint, though, countless times weaker when compared to Shadowed Star’s.</p>
<p>However, World Principles were still World Principles, a concept that even Origin Kings were unable to touch!</p>
<p>The question was now, how could Xiao Xiao suddenly begin giving off traces of Heavenly Law?</p>
<p>After recalling all his previous experiences in search of an answer, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as a bold guess emerged in his heart, “Did you swallow and refine the Star Source of this Dead Star? Did this Dead Star actually have a Star Source to begin with?”</p>
<p>Xiao Xiao raised his dim eyes and looked at Yang Kai with a blank expression for a while before raising his foot and began stumbling about before tripping over himself and falling to the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he realized that Xiao Xiao wasn’t in any danger, but was simply unable to completely digest the power of the Dead Star’s Source, causing his control over his own strength to become unstable. Realizing this, Yang Kai simply took Xiao Xiao back into the Sealed World Bead.</p>
<p>However, this entire situation was quite a surprise to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>That this Dead Star still had its own Star Source was a shocking discovery.</p>
<p>It should be impossible for a Dead Star to possess a Star Source because, without World Energy, there simply could not be World Principles, naturally meaning there was no way for a Star Source to be born. This was the same concept as a person dying and their body rotting, their essence disappearing leaving behind only withered bones.</p>
<p>However, there were always exceptions to the rules.</p>
<p>According to Yang Kai’s own previous speculations, this Dead Star was originally an extremely vibrant Cultivation Star that had for some reason died throughout thousands, if not millions of years. As such, some of its original Source could have remained.</p>
<p>Xiao Xiao had obviously dug deep underground and found the remains of this Star Source and swallowed it.</p>
<p>This was a great blessing. If it was the Star Source of a true Cultivation Star, Xiao Xiao would never have been able to refine it.</p>
<p>This kind of refining was completely different from the refining Yang Kai performed to become a Star Master. Star Master and Cultivation Star were closely linked, sharing honour and disgrace. After Yang Kai became a Star Master though, Shadowed Star’s Star Source still existed, there was now just a mysterious connection between them that allowed Yang Kai to use many conveniences on Shadowed Star that others could not.</p>
<p>Xiao Xiao, on the other hand, had directly swallowed and absorbed this place’s Star Source, meaning it was gone forever and would not be completely converted into Xiao Xiao’s strength.</p>
<p>Various thoughts flashed through Yang Kai’s head, making him more and more certain his guess was correct.</p>
<p>Since Xiao Xiao was fine though, Yang Kai was no longer as worried about this. After talking to Qian Tong and Ye Xi Yun, he departed from the Ore Star and continued his journey.</p>
<p>Traversing the Star Field was desolate and lonely, especially in this region where there were no Cultivation Stars at all.</p>
<p>Through his Star Chart, Yang Kai confirmed that the nearest Cultivation Star was at least a year away.</p>
<p>Not becoming irritable or impatient, Yang Kai would sometimes travel under his own strength, while at other times he would land on an asteroid and cultivate while allowing it to carry him forward.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he would land on Dead Stars he came across to search for gains.</p>
<p>However, Dead Stars were Dead Stars in the end, and despite searching a number of them, Yang Kai didn’t have much of a harvest. It could be said that his discovery of that Ore Star was simply a stroke of luck.</p>
<p>Such an accident was not going to happen a second time.</p>
<p>That being said, Yang Kai arranged another Cross-Cultivation Star Space Array on a certain Dead Star he passed by, connecting it with the previous one.</p>
<p>During this period, Xiao Xiao had been asleep inside the Sealed World Bead, not moving at all. However, Yang Kai was aware that Xiao Xiao was now slowly releasing a thick, impurity-like casing from his body, forming a kind of stone cocoon around himself.</p>
<p>This was quite similar to his original state as a stone embryo.</p>
<p>[Could Stone Puppets evolve?] While Yang Kai was suspicious, he was also looking forward to it, wondering what kind of changes Xiao Xiao would experience after he emerged from the cocoon.</p>
<p>After many days of cultivating, Yang Kai also faintly noticed a kind of barrier blocking his path forward.</p>
<p>This was the barrier which separated him from the Origin King Realm! Only by breaking through these shackles could Yang Kai reach the Origin King Realm.</p>
<p>At this time, if he could find a Cultivation Star and enter retreat for a year, or even half a year, Yang Kai was confident he could make a breakthrough attempt.</p>
<p>One day, Yang Kai was performing a check on Xiao Xiao’s condition.</p>
<p>Because Xiao Xiao had not moved at all for the past year or so, Yang Kai would check in on him occasionally. This time, however, some faint fluctuations were coming from the cocoon, a clear sign Xiao Xiao was about to emerge from it.</p>
<p>Joyful, Yang Kai immediately looked for a place to stay for a while to wait for Xiao Xiao to complete his evolution.</p>
<p>After scanning his surroundings, Yang Kai rushed straight towards a nearby Asteroid Sea.</p>
<p>This Asteroid Sea was quietly suspended in the void, with no signs of movement at all within or around it, the perfect place to enter retreat for a while.</p>
<p>However, when Yang Kai approached the Asteroid Sea, he suddenly frowned.</p>
<p>He noticed that several auras were trying to conceal themselves in this Asteroid Sea. Although these people were doing their best to remain hidden, it was obvious each one was a powerful Origin Realm master.</p>
<p>It was only because Yang Kai’s Divine Sense was much more powerful than average that he could notice this group.</p>
<p>These people sneakily hiding here were obviously plotting something nefarious.</p>
<p>Yang Kai felt his luck was quite bad, as he did not want to be caught up in this kind of turbid water, so he quickly turned around and left.</p>
<p>However, his figure had only moved slightly when a brilliant glimmer flashed in the distance, transforming into a beam of light which shot out from behind one of the asteroids.</p>
<p>A terrifying power radiated from this streak of light as it rapidly closed the several-dozen-kilometre distance between Yang Kai and the asteroid, causing him to feel a slight tightness on his skin.</p>
<p>“An Origin King!” Yang Kai’s face sank when he realized there was an Origin King Realm master hidden in this Asteroid Sea! Even he had not noticed the presence of such a powerful master until just now.</p>
<p>Kings and Origin Realm masters were completely different existences, and there was a vast gap between them, which was why so many remained stuck at the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm their entire life, never able to spy on the mysteries of the Origin King realm.</p>
<p>This hidden master suddenly making a move obviously indicated they intended to kill Yang Kai with a single blow.</p>
<p>However, the master who took action greatly underestimated Yang Kai’s strength. Faced with such a terrifying blow, Yang Kai let out a long roar, stretched out his hand, and weaved together hundreds of his Golden Blood Threads to condense a great golden shield to protect himself!</p>
<h2>Chapter 1733, Can You Explain Now?</h2>
<p><em>Hong…</em></p>
<p>With a loud bang and a flash of golden light, Yang Kai was sent flying as he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>The sturdy shield he condensed from hundreds of Golden Blood Threads had failed to completely block this blow, which shocked him greatly.</p>
<p>However, at the moment of impact, Yang Kai was able to see clearly what he had been attacked by.</p>
<p>It was a long spear over three metres in length and the thickness of a small child’s arm, its whole form radiating a dazzling light and an extraordinary energy fluctuation.</p>
<p>An Origin King Grade artifact!</p>
<p>Although the spear’s main thrust was blocked by the blood shield Yang Kai condensed, the sharp aura it gave off was not completely dissipated and managed to pierce his body, making him feel as if he had been stabbed by countless tiny needles and causing his meridians and physique to ache while his face to distorted.</p>
<p>With the cultivation of the person who launched this sneak attack and the terrifying power of this spear, an ordinary Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator would have been killed instantly, but thanks to his strong foundation and form, Yang Kai was only slightly injured.</p>
<p>From when he left Shadowed Star until now, this was the first encounter Yang Kai had with foreign cultivators, but he never expected that he would actually be attacked by an Origin King with an Origin King Grade artifact.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s heart filled with anger as he turned his head and glared towards the distant Asteroid Sea like a fierce beast before turning around and flying off into the distance, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>After delivering its blow, the long spear which hit Yang Kai flew back the same way it came and landed in the hands of a middle-aged man standing on a huge asteroid.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man had a sinister look about him and wore dark blue robes on his body. A gloomy aura pulsed from his figure, making none dare to approach within ten metres of him.</p>
<p>Holding his artifact, the middle-aged man showed a look of surprise on his face, as if he was shocked he could not kill Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Interesting. Not only was he able to sense our presence, he even managed to survive after taking this King’s attack,” The middle-aged man smiled fiercely before glancing over in the direction Yang Kai escaped and asking. “Do any of you know who that was?”</p>
<p>Around this man there stood at least twenty Origin Returning Realm masters, all of them above the Second-Order. Hearing this question, these masters exchanged glances before all shaking their heads, indicating that none of them knew who Yang Kai was.</p>
<p>“Since none of you know him, he must really be a passerby,” The middle-aged man pondered for a moment before declaring. “But this matter is very important and there is no room for mistakes, so even if he was just passing by, we cannot let him go.”</p>
<p>“Sir, after taking your blow, will he survive?” Someone asked.</p>
<p>Just now, they all saw the attack this middle-aged man launched and none of them were confident they could take it without dying! Although the other party’s origins were unknown, he was still just an Origin Realm cultivator in the end, so it should be impossible for him to live.</p>
<p>“It never hurts to be cautious. Zhang Fu and Liu Dong, go bring his corpse back to this King!” The middle-aged commanded, clearly thinking that Yang Kai surviving was simply a stroke of luck and he escaped on the verge of death.</p>
<p>“Yes!” Two Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators who were named immediately summoned their Star Shuttles and chased after the escaping Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Thirty thousand kilometres away from where Yang Kai had been attacked, atop a drifting asteroid, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, watching the direction he had come from, waiting quietly.</p>
<p>Although he did not know why that Origin King had just attacked him, judging from how they were stealthily trying to conceal themselves, it was fairly obvious they were lying in ambush for someone, and even if Yang Kai had only passed by on accident, he might have disturbed their plans.</p>
<p>In other words, the other party had attacked him in an attempt to silence the witness to the crime.</p>
<p>That being the case, even if he tried to escape now, the other party would definitely not let him go! Yang Kai was certain someone would come to pursue him soon.</p>
<p>It was precisely because of this judgment that Yang Kai had deliberately stopped and did not leave in a hurry.</p>
<p>After inexplicably suffering such a big loss, how could Yang Kai simply walk away? Although the opponent’s attack was terrifying, Yang Kai also noticed that the one who delivered it was just a First-Order Origin King.</p>
<p>He had even killed Luo Hai, so why would he need to fear a mere First-Order Origin King? Although there was no Star Emperor Token for Yang Kai to use anymore, even if he could not defeat this Origin King, he would have no problem escaping.</p>
<p>Luo Hai had chased Yang Kai for several months through the Star Field back then, causing him extreme distress but never capturing him. Could this unknown First-Order Origin King be faster or more powerful than Luo Hai?</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s guess was correct, and after waiting just half a cup of tea’s time on this asteroid, two rays of light suddenly appeared in the distance. Judging from the brightness and speed of these streaks, the pursuers who had arrived were two Third-Order Origin Realm cultivators.</p>
<p>A sarcastic smile appeared at the corner of Yang Kai’s lips but as his pursuers got closer, he quickly put that expression away and instead wore one of panic, hurriedly leapt up from the asteroid, summoned his Star Shuttle, and continued to fly forward.</p>
<p>However, making the most of this act, Yang Kai deliberately moved at much less than his peak speed, pretending his injuries were not light and giving the appearance of an arrow at the end of its flight.</p>
<p>When the two cultivators named Zhang Fu and Liu Dong saw this, they exchanged a knowing glance before following behind Yang Kai at a leisurely pace, intending to play a game of cat and mouse and enjoy this little distraction before killing him.</p>
<p>Flying forward, Yang Kai would occasionally look back, as if he was afraid that he would be overtaken.</p>
<p>This sight made Zhang Fu and Liu Dong even more unscrupulous, not only intentionally tailing behind Yang Kai instead of immediately attacking, but also repeatedly taunting and threatening him.</p>
<p>After an hour, estimating that he had travelled far enough now, Yang Kai suddenly came to a stop, turned around, and stood his ground.</p>
<p>With a flash of light, Zhang Fu and Liu Dong appeared in front of Yang Kai and stood at a distance of about three hundred metres, looking at him mockingly.</p>
<p>The taller Zhang Fu swept his eyes over Yang Kai and snickered, “Boy, you’re pretty good. Even after suffering a blow from Senior Li’s Soul Breaker Spear, you didn’t immediately die. This Zhang is impressed!”</p>
<p>“Senior Li?” Yang Kai frowned, his face pale and gloomy to the extreme, coughing frequently as he asked, “I have no grievances with you, why would your Senior Li attack me? “</p>
<p>Zhang Fu smiled coldly as he casually played with a ring-shaped artifact he was holding as he spoke lightly, “We truly have no grievances or grudges between us, you can only blame your bad luck for passing through here. Heh heh, Senior Li hates it when his plans are interrupted the most.”</p>
<p>“What plans?” Yang Kai asked.</p>
<p>Liu Dong, standing next to Zhang Fu, cut in impatiently, “Brat, you’re about to die, why bother asking so many questions?”</p>
<p>“It is precisely because I’m about to die that I’m asking, so at least I don’t die ignorant!” Yang Kai slowly shook his head.</p>
<p>“You want to understand why you’re about to die?” Zhang Fu looked at Yang Kai and sneered.</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“It’s not that I can’t tell you. You-” Zhang Fu said in a joking tone, but Liu Dong interrupted him before he finished.</p>
<p>“Enough nonsense, just hurry up and kill him, it’s important we bring his corpse back to Senior Li as quickly as possible!”</p>
<p>“Fair enough!” Zhang Fu nodded in agreement before he glanced towards the Space Ring on Yang Kai’s hand, “This brat was able to take Senior Li’s strike without dying, so he can’t be an average guy. There must be many good things on him. How about we split whatever is in his ring fifty-fifty?”</p>
<p>“Agreed!” Liu Dong nodded.</p>
<p>The two of them began deciding how to divide up Yang Kai’s belongings before even finishing him off. In any case, Senior Li only said they needed to bring his corpse back, he never said anything about the treasures on him. Naturally, these items would line their pockets as they believed that with his status and strength, Senior Li would disdain to snatch them from them.</p>
<p>“You want my things?” Yang Kai grinned slightly as he suddenly spoke in a cold tone, “I’m afraid they’ll cost you your lives!”</p>
<p>“Insane brat!” Liu Dong snorted coldly, but in the next moment, his complexion changed drastically, and his eyes bulged as he stared towards Yang Kai’s original location, because no one was there.</p>
<p>At some point, Yang Kai had mysteriously vanished.</p>
<p>Suddenly Liu Dong felt a faint chill run across his neck, and he heard Zhang Fu’s horrified shout ring in his ears, “Brother Liu, dodge!”</p>
<p>Liu Dong was a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master, so the moment he noticed Yang Kai had disappeared, he realized something was not right. Hearing Zhang Fu’s warning, he pushed his Saint Qi to its limits and tried to flee without any hesitation.</p>
<p>But to his horror, the Saint Qi in his body was instantly suppressed by an astonishing Shi, causing not just him, but the space around him to completely freeze.</p>
<p>Could such a powerful Shi really exist? Liu Dong felt his blood run cold as he desperately tried to push his own Shi to resist.</p>
<p>This was a standard part of battle between Origin Realm masters, where the difference in strength between their respective Shis ultimately determined who emerged victoriously.</p>
<p>However, the reality in front of Liu Dong only made him more desperate. The Shi he released from his body was like a snowflake under the scorching sun, melting away in an instant, unable to even take shape.</p>
<p>At that moment, he felt a chill come from his neck and as he gazed down, he saw a headless corpse standing in the void, red blood spraying from its neck like a beautiful fountain.</p>
<p>This person’s clothes, figure, and even the ring on his hand looked so similar to his own.</p>
<p>[I’m already dead?]</p>
<p>Cold sweat leaked from Liu Dong’s forehead as he faintly realized his situation, but soon darkness overtook him, swallowing his consciousness and vitality.</p>
<p>“Can you explain now?” When Yang Kai reappeared, he was already standing just ten metres in front of Zhang Fu, his complexion ruddy with no sign that he was injured at all.</p>
<p>Staring at Zhang Fu coldly, Yang Kai played with a single Golden Blood Thread at his fingertips that waved around like a living snake, looking for an opportunity to strike.</p>
<p>Zhang Fu shuddered as he felt a cold chill from the soles of his feet to the top of his head, his spirit almost collapsing entirely!</p>
<p>Liu Dong, whose strength equalled his own, was decapitated by this young man in a single instant.</p>
<p>When it happened, Zhang Fu only saw a golden light flashing across Liu Dong’s neck, he did not even see how Yang Kai moved.</p>
<p>Did such a powerful Origin Realm cultivator exist in this world?</p>
<p>Even if Senior Li wanted to kill them, he could not have done so this easily, right?</p>
<p>Zhang Fu stood on the spot with a pale face as big beads of sweat dripped from his forehead and slid down his face.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1734, Universe Sword Body</h2>
<p>“Your companion was a bit tactless, so he died!” Yang Kai looked at Zhang Fu indifferently, without the slightest emotion in his eyes, making Zhang Fu sweat even more profusely.</p>
<p>He wanted to escape but found that he couldn’t muster the courage.</p>
<p>He had a feeling that if he really tried to run, he would be the next one seeing his own decapitated body.</p>
<p>“I hope your answers can satisfy me!” Yang Kai continued to put pressure on Zhang Fu as he observed his victim carefully.</p>
<p>Zhang Fu’s complexion was forlorn, and his eyes showed a clear light of fear. Pursing his dry lips, he asked, “If I tell you what you want to know, will you let me go?”</p>
<p>“What do you think?” Yang Kai sneered.</p>
<p>Zhang Fu’s body trembled as he gathered his courage and said, “Since you won’t let me go, why should I cooperate with you? Either way, I’ll die.”</p>
<p>“I can kill you quickly, so you won’t even notice you died!” Yang Kai smiled gently.</p>
<p>This smile was like that of a reaper from hell and Zhang Fu felt that this young man he was facing was scarier than Senior Li.</p>
<p>“I need to think about it!” Zhang Fu gulped hard as his eyes drifted about, obviously trying to find a way to escape.</p>
<p>Yang Kai just observed with a smile for a moment before flicking his wrist, causing the golden thread at his fingertips to flicker. Zhang Fu saw this, screamed, and hurriedly tried to dodge.</p>
<p>However, before he could dodge, a powerful Shi wrapped him up making it impossible for him to even move!</p>
<p>Zhang Fu’s eyes shrank as he looked down to find that the tips of his fingers on his left hand had been sheared off, as if they were sliced by some kind of extremely sharp blade, leaving a smooth wound that blood continued to splash out of.</p>
<p>The pain of this injury was nothing for a battle-hardened Origin Realm master, but what frightened Zhang Fu was that he had no power to fight back in front of Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Both of them were Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators, but the other party was like an aloof god who could easily control his life or death!</p>
<p>The golden light flashed again…</p>
<p>Zhang Fu felt a twang of pain again as his left fingers were shaved down slightly more, the severed pieces drifting away slowly right before his eyes.</p>
<p>The other party did not speak anymore and simply kept waving his hand, sending out the golden thread every once in a while.</p>
<p>Another slice was taken, then another…</p>
<p>Zhang Fu’s left hand was slowly but surely cut away and soon disappeared altogether, leaving him with only a handless left arm. Yang Kai showed no intention of stopping though and instead continued his task with meticulous precision, cutting off small pieces of Zhang Fu’s left arm now that his hand was gone.</p>
<p>What caused Zhang Fu to tremble though was that while this young man continued this slow torture, he spoke in a callous voice to explain what he was doing. “After cutting off your left arm, I will cut off your right, then your left leg, then your right leg. I believe that with your cultivation, you won’t die even after that, so I’ll then begin cutting off parts of your body, but don’t worry, I’ll make sure you survive long enough to witness your heart being cut apart, so you understand exactly how you died.”</p>
<p>Zhang Fu could no longer hold back the panic in his heart and shouted, “Enough, whatever you want to know, I’ll tell you! Just stop!”</p>
<p>One death was not equal to another. Suffering slowly and dying painlessly were completely different concepts. Zhang Fu could not bear watching himself slowly be cut apart; just thinking about such a scene made him shudder uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Yang Kai paused and looked at him lightly before chuckling, “If you’d done this earlier, you could have avoided some pain. What was there to hesitate about?”</p>
<p>Zhang Fu grit his teeth and spat, “The winner is the King, the loser is the villain, just tell me what you want to know.”</p>
<p>“Good! Who are you!” Yang Kai went straight to the point.</p>
<p>“We’re from Sword Union!”</p>
<p>“Sword Union?” Yang Kai raised his brow.</p>
<p>Sword Union was one of the Star Field’s hegemons, a super force that controlled several Cultivation Stars. Although it was not as large as Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, its strength was not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>In fact, Yang Kai had some dealings with Sword Union’s cultivators before, but that was many years ago. In the Star Field, in addition to Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce and Sword Union, there was another super force Purple Star, as well other significant players like Galaxy Ridge and Abandoned Lair, each one occupying their own territory, fighting amongst themselves for dominance.</p>
<p>“Who are you trying to ambush by hiding here?” Yang Kai asked again.</p>
<p>Zhang Fu’s eyes flickered as his look became hesitant, but in the end, he grit his teeth and replied, “The one we’re here to ambush is also from Sword Union.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai looked at him with a strange expression.</p>
<p>Zhang Fu quickly explained, “I’m not lying to you! The one we’re here to ambush is our enemy! Although everyone belongs to Sword Union, there are different factions!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded lightly. From the other person’s eyes, Yang Kai could see that he wasn’t lying and his explanation was also reasonable.</p>
<p>For a great force such as Sword Union, its internal structure was naturally complicated and power struggles were inevitable; however, setting up an ambush like this seemed somewhat excessive.</p>
<p>“Explain in detail,” Yang Kai asked, just to be safe.</p>
<p>Since Zhang Fu had chosen to cooperate, naturally he did not try to hide anything and immediately told Yang Kai everything he knew.</p>
<p>In Sword Union, there were apparently several different factions, but two dominated above the rest. One faction was led by the current Union Master while the other was headed by the Vice Union Master. These two factions had been fighting one another for many years.</p>
<p>The Senior Li Zhang Fu mentioned before, whose real name was Li Ming Hai, belonged to the Vice Union Master’s faction.</p>
<p>This time they were here to ambush the rising star of the Union Master’s faction, the direct descendant of Sword Union’s Union Master Gu Cang Yun, Gu Jian Xin!</p>
<p>“A rising star, even the descendant of your Union Master, is actually worth dispatching an Origin King to ambush?” Yang Kai looked at Zhang Fu in astonishment before pensively asking, “What is it about this person that you are all so afraid of?”</p>
<p>Zhang Fu smiled bitterly, “If it was just an ordinary Origin Realm master, naturally we wouldn’t need to pay him so much attention, but the Young Union Master possesses the Universe Sword Body and has now reached the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm. If he breaks through to the Origin King Realm, the Vice Union Master’s faction will have no future, so we need to take advantage of this time, when he has no strong guardians, to take action. Your appearance disrupted Senior Li’s plan, so he tried to kill you.”</p>
<p>“Universe Sword Body?” Yang Kai touched his chin, “Some type of Special Constitution, isn’t it? What’s so terrifying about it?”</p>
<p>“The Young Union Master is only sixty years old this year yet has already reached the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, what isn’t terrifying about it?” Zhang Fu said solemnly, “I think your true age is also not very big, and your strength is quite good, but if you were to be facing our Young Union Master, it’s not certain who would win or lose!”</p>
<p>“Really?” Yang Kai chuckled.</p>
<p>A cultivator who reached the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm in less than sixty years was indeed a top talent! However, Yang Kai was only about fifty, even younger than this Gu Jian Xin!</p>
<p>When cultivators cultivated, they often did not notice the passage of time, so they didn’t care much about age.</p>
<p>“If it’s true what you say, then I am somewhat interested in your Young Union Master,” Yang Kai snickered.</p>
<p>Zhang Fu swept his eyes over Yang Kai before nodding, “People like you will collide with each other one day, creating great sparks, but… that will all depend on the Young Union Master escaping this tribulation alive! Good, have I told you everything you want to know?”</p>
<p>“En!” Yang Kai nodded lightly at him.</p>
<p>“Then do it!” Zhang Fu urged impatiently, but there were still no signs of Yang Kai acting. Instead, his consciousness just became blurred in the next moment.</p>
<p>Sure enough… he did not even know what happened!</p>
<p>Standing in place, Yang Kai took Zhang Fu and Liu Dong’s Space Rings then burned down their bodies with his Demonic Flames. Pondering for a moment, Yang Kai summoned his Star Shuttle again and flew back the way he came.</p>
<p>He had not sought trouble, but that Li Ming Hai hadn’t even said a word and tried to kill him for simply passing by. How could Yang Kai tolerate such an affront? After being beaten by someone, how could he not hit back?</p>
<p>Yang Kai was planning on joining the fun! If he could find a chance to kill Li Ming Hai, that would be best.</p>
<p>In the Asteroid Sea, the group of cultivators headed by Li Ming Hai waited quietly, like patient beasts ready to pounce.</p>
<p>After a long time though, someone frowned and said, “Why haven’t Zhang Fu and Liu Dong come back? With their skills, could they have failed?”</p>
<p>“Did they encounter some kind of danger?”</p>
<p>“Is there any danger around here? You don’t want to say they were killed by that guy, do you?”</p>
<p>“How could that be? That guy took a blow from Senior Li and was lucky to have even survived. How could he have the strength to fight against Zhang Fu and Liu Dong? However, it is strange they have not come back after so long, should we go out and look for them?” A man asked Li Ming Hai.</p>
<p>“No, if they cannot even handle such a simple matter, their lives are worthless! Do not act carelessly, within a day or two the Young Union Master’s Starship will pass through here. Just wait quietly.”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>After a brief conversation, the group of ambushers went silent, only occasionally glancing in a certain direction, looking forward to the arrival of the Young Union Master’s Starship.</p>
<p>This Asteroid Sea was quite large, so it was easy to hide in, otherwise, Li Ming Hai would not have chosen to ambush Gu Jian Xin’s Starship in this place.</p>
<p>It was because it was so big that Yang Kai was not spotted when he snuck around and approached.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yang Kai had gotten to within a hundred kilometres of Li Ming Hai’s group.</p>
<p>He also hid behind a big asteroid and stared in the direction of Li Ming Hai with a cold expression.</p>
<p>With his current strength, he could simply have charged forward and attacked. Even if he could not kill Li Ming Hai this way, it would not be a problem for him to kill a few of his subordinates and retreat calmly.</p>
<p>But Yang Kai didn’t choose this course of action. It was Li Ming Hai who injured him before, so he wanted to settle accounts with him personally.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was also waiting. Waiting for the Young Union Master to arrive and for the two sides to fight so he could find an opportunity to launch his own sneak attack, repaying the earlier favour he received in kind!</p>
<h2>Chapter 1735, Gu Jian Xin</h2>
<p>Somewhere in the Asteroid Sea, Yang Kai concealed both his figure and aura. He believed that it would be impossible for them to find any trace of him even if they were separated by just a hundred kilometres and the opponent was an Origin King Realm master.</p>
<p>Taking the opportunity, Yang Kai inspected Xiao Xiao’s condition again.</p>
<p>It was because he noticed some changes in Xiao Xiao before that he thought about entering this Asteroid Sea to stop for a while, ultimately resulting in him being sneak attacked by Li Ming Hai.</p>
<p>With some time on his hands now, Yang Kai naturally turned his attention to Xiao Xiao again.</p>
<p>After a brief inspection, Yang Kai was overjoyed.</p>
<p>The stone cocoon which had formed around Xiao Xiao now showed visible cracks, similar to the ones which appeared when he was first born. This was an obvious sign that Xiao Xiao was about to break out of his shell.</p>
<p>It was not suitable to have him break out in the Asteroid Sea. Yang Kai didn’t know if the Stone Puppet’s evolution would cause any obvious signs. If he stayed here, it would only be discovered by Li Ming Hai and others.</p>
<p>With no other choice, Yang Kai could only dive into the Sealed World Bead with Xiao Xiao.</p>
<p>Since bringing the elites from the Human, Monster, and Demon Races from Tong Xuan Realm to High Heaven Sect, the Small Sealed World had once again become vacant.</p>
<p>Staring at the stone cocoon in front of him, Yang Kai waited quietly.</p>
<p>Soon after, the stone cocoon made a cracking sound, and the existing fissures became bigger and denser.</p>
<p>Finally, after cracks filled the entire stone cocoon’s surface, Xiao Xiao burst out of it.</p>
<p>Xiao Xiao’s body dexterously fell in front of Yang Kai, his eyes which had been somewhat dull before were now extremely bright, seeming to contain the light of wisdom.</p>
<p>Discovering that Yang Kai was watching him, Xiao Xiao grinned, then stood there scratching his head with his knee-length arms.</p>
<p>Yang Kai stroked his chin as he released his Divine Sense and scanned Xiao Xiao.</p>
<p>“Nothing changed!” After a long while, he murmured with a suspicious look on his face.</p>
<p>After this most recent evolution, Yang Kai had expected Xiao Xiao to experience some kind of radical change, but now it seemed his expectations were a little too high. Xiao Xiao did undergo some changes after swallowing so many rare ores on that Dead Star.</p>
<p>After absorbing the essence of these ores, Xiao Xiao had become noticeably stronger.</p>
<p>This was similar to how a cultivator would take pills used for cultivation, resulting in a definite increase in strength.</p>
<p>But other than that, there did not seem to be any big changes!</p>
<p>If there was anything, it was that Xiao Xiao’s eyes had become nimbler, a clear sign his sentience had increased, but it had still not reached a remarkable level.</p>
<p>“Show me your bigger form!” Yang Kai commanded.</p>
<p>Xiao Xiao immediately obeyed and transformed into his stone giant form, reaching a dozen metres in height, giving off an awe-inspiring and oppressive air!</p>
<p>“And your lava armour?” Yang Kai asked again.</p>
<p>Xiao Xiao’s surface instantly released flaming hot Sun’s True Fire, creating a layer of flowing, terrifying magma around him.</p>
<p>“Yeah… there are no noticeable changes!” Yang Kai frowned as he felt he was failing to understand something. It was reasonable to think that after swallowing the remnant Star Source of that Dead Star Xiao Xiao had obtained some great benefits.</p>
<p>After all, after swallowing it, his reaction was extremely strong and even caused him to revert to a stone cocoon form.</p>
<p>But the final result turned out to be so anticlimactic.</p>
<p>Unable to understand it for the time being, Yang Kai did not bother continuing to probe this matter. There was plenty of time in the future to study what had happened so Yang Kai simply commanded Xiao Xiao to resume his regular form and left him in the Small Sealed World.</p>
<p>As soon as he returned to the asteroid he was hiding on before, Yang Kai realized that something had changed.</p>
<p>A hundred kilometres away, Li Ming Hai’s group had used some kind of Secret Technique to further conceal their auras, almost disappearing from Yang Kai’s perception.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the distance, a Starship was slowly approaching!</p>
<p>This was the Starship of Sword Union’s Young Union Master!</p>
<p>This Young Union Master had come rather quickly. No wonder Li Ming Hai had not hesitated to attack Yang Kai. Obviously, the time before their plan was to start was very soon and Li Ming Hai had not wanted there to be any accidents.</p>
<p>In the end though, not only had Li Ming Hai failed to kill Yang Kai, he had also provoked a hidden enemy for himself. If Li Ming Hai knew this, it was not clear how he would react.</p>
<p>Yang Kai looked towards the location of the approaching Starship and judged it would be at most an hour before the two parties met. Unable to stop himself from drawing a sharp breath, Yang Kai waited in anticipation for a good show!</p>
<p>As time passed little by little, the atmosphere in the huge Asteroid Sea seemed to become tense.</p>
<p>Soon, Yang Kai discovered that Sword Union’s Young Union Master was travelling in a convoy of Starships, with the centre one being slightly larger, about three hundred metres in length.</p>
<p>The left and right Starships were only two hundred metres each.</p>
<p>A small fleet of three Starships!</p>
<p>As they were still too far away, Yang Kai did not know what grade these three Starships were, but they weren’t lower than Origin Grade.</p>
<p>Sword Union was indeed a super force! Origin Grade Starships were considered strategic assets to the Sects on Shadowed Star, but Sword Union could send out three together.</p>
<p>However, the appearance of these three Starships was far different from the one refined by Yang Yan. Bluntly put, these Starships looked more like big sailing ships, especially the one in the middle. It was like a great ocean vessel sailing across the Starry Sky. Its bow was quite sharp, and the body was slender, almost giving it the appearance of a long sword from a distance.</p>
<p>On the decks of the three Starships, cultivators could be seen moving about.</p>
<p>The approaching Starships were clearly unaware of the crisis waiting in ambush in this Asteroid Sea and sailed straight towards it at speed. When the distance shrank to only fifty kilometres though, Li Ming Hai, who had been hiding behind a giant asteroid, decided to take action.</p>
<p>Even if they were separated by a hundred kilometres, Yang Kai could clearly feel a powerful wave of energy well up and from several nearby locations in the Asteroid Sea, an intense light appeared.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, dozens of white light beams shot out from the Asteroid Sea like arrows from a bow, showering down on the three Starships in the distance like a rain of lightning.</p>
<p>With such an obvious disturbance and such powerful energy fluctuations, the three Starships obviously took notice and the cultivators on deck all rushed out, summoned their defensive artifacts, and protected the Starship as best they could.</p>
<p>The three Starships themselves also reacted extremely quickly.</p>
<p>With a brilliant flash, a visible energy barrier surrounded each of the three Starships. The Starships also rapidly changed course in an attempt to dodge the incoming fire.</p>
<p>However, Li Ming Hai and his subordinates had been waiting here for quite some time and were well prepared. The sneak attack they launched was perfectly timed, making it impossible for the three Starships to avoid being hit.</p>
<p>The several dozen white pillars of light hit upon the three Starships like a giant wave crashing upon them.</p>
<p>A brighter light erupted as the Starship on the far left was unable to withstand this attack, its shield shattering before its hull was penetrated by several beams of light, resulting in severe damage and a massive explosion!</p>
<p>No one could escape from the ship’s destruction.</p>
<p>The cultivators on this Starship, along with the Starship itself, were extinguished entirely by Li Ming Hai’s first sneak attack!</p>
<p>The Starship on the right had better luck. Although its defensive shield was also worn down rapidly, it had suffered far fewer attacks and its hull was only penetrated by two pillars of light.</p>
<p>Although the Starship was clearly crippled, it did not explode apart, so at least part of the crew had managed to survive.</p>
<p>The cultivators who survived fled from the Starship in a hurry though with everyone in a flurry as they searched for the enemy. After seeing what had become of the left-most Starship, these survivors felt both fear and anger deep in their hearts.</p>
<p>Among the three Starships, only the one in the middle, the largest, remained in relatively good condition.</p>
<p>Although it had withstood more attacks than the other two ships, this Starship was obviously of a very high grade and its defensive shield was not completely breached, though it had become extremely dim.</p>
<p>Before the survivors could recover, Li Ming Hai and his subordinates rushed out.</p>
<p>Immediately after triggering the pillars of light, Li Ming Hai and his subordinates took action, seemingly having anticipated this situation. Arriving in front of the surviving starships, these ambushers summoned their offensive artifacts and began attacking.</p>
<p>The already dim defensive shield was quickly broken.</p>
<p>“Li Ming Hai! So it’s you!” From the middle Starship, a terrifying roar rang out. By listening to this voice, it was clear it belonged to a young man who was filled with monstrous anger, “You dare attack this Young Master? Do you understand the consequences of your actions?”</p>
<p>“The consequences of attacking the Young Union Master, this old master is well aware,” Among the crowd, the exposed Li Ming Hai remained indifferent, not showing the slightest panic. “This old master is also an Elder of Sword Union, so how could he not understand the rules? However, if Young Union Master thinks he can dissuade this old master with such flimsy talk of rules, this old master will have to disappoint.”</p>
<p>“Good, very good! It seems that you are ready to bear the violent anger of this Young Master,” From the Starship, Gu Jian Xin’s voice echoed and soon, a young man appeared on its deck. This young man had a brave and heroic appearance, with a handsome face and a sharp light in his eyes that seemed to gleam like swords.</p>
<p>Sword Union’s Young Union Master, Gu Jian Xin!</p>
<p>Standing tall, like a sword, on the Starship’s deck, even facing an Origin King like Li Ming Hai, he did not show the slightest bit of fear, his expression simply remaining cold and indifferent.</p>
<p>Next to Gu Jian Xin there were two women, one to the left, one to the right. One was tall and had rich curves and lustrous eyes. The other was quite petite and had a delicate-looking face and long black hair that reached all the way down her back. These two women had completely different appearances and temperaments, but they both shared the same fearless, even somewhat eager, look on their faces as Gu Jian Xin.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1736, Three Swords Brilliance Secret Technique</h2>
<p>Li Ming Hai and Gu Jian Xin’s eyes collided and sparks seemed to fly.</p>
<p>The former soon frowned slightly though.</p>
<p>He was shocked to discover that Gu Jian Xin’s aura was thicker than when he saw him last.</p>
<p>It seemed the rumours were true. If there were no surprises, Young Union Master Gu Jian Xin would be able to attempt to break through to the Origin King Realm within the next three to five years!</p>
<p>Once he successfully reached the Origin King Realm, with his Universe Sword Body’s Special Constitution, coupled with the Left and Right Sword Servants, no ordinary First-Order Origin King would be his opponent. He would even be able to fight with some Second-Order Origin Kings!</p>
<p>A true monster! No wonder Vice Union Master Wei Qian Zong was so eager to eradicate Gu Jian Xin, obviously, he had noticed just how terrifying the latter’s growth had become.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a rare opportunity had presented itself here today. As long as Gu Jian Xin died, Sword Union would fall into the Vice Union Master’s hands in the future; after all, a genius who failed to mature was no genius!</p>
<p>“Li Ming Hai, this Young Master has only one question!” Gu Jian Xin stood on the deck with his hands behind his back, “How did you know that this Young Master would travel through here?”</p>
<p>Li Ming Hai narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Young Union Master already knows the answer in his heart, why bother asking this old master?”</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin nodded lightly, “It seems that there are traitors around this Young Master. Very well, once this is all over, this Young Master will route them out.”</p>
<p>“Young Union Master need not worry about such matters as you have no future!” Li Ming Hai waved his hand and shouted, “Kill them all, don’t let a single one escape!”</p>
<p>If there were any survivors from this incident, it would bring great trouble, so Li Ming Hai didn’t plan to leave any witnesses alive.</p>
<p>With the order given, the Origin Realm masters around Li Ming Hai took action, attacking the enemy cultivators who had escaped the right escort Starship.</p>
<p>Atop the middle Starship where Gu Jian Xin stood, a large number of cultivators also emerged, eager to meet the enemy.</p>
<p>Instantly, the Asteroid Sea was filled with brilliant flashes of light as artifacts and Secret Techniques continued to bloom.</p>
<p>Although there weren’t many people on Li Ming Hai’s side, thirty at most; all of them were masters at or above the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm, giving his side a very high combat effectiveness. On the other side, Gu Jian Xin had two hundred or so cultivators supporting him, but their cultivations were somewhat mixed and the number of masters they had was less than Li Ming Hai’s side.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, with an Origin King like Li Ming Hai presiding over the situation, the pressure on Gu Jian Xin’s side was too great, making it difficult for the Origin Realm masters on the latter’s side to display their full strength.</p>
<p>As such, when the two sides made contact, Gu Jian Xin’s side immediately began suffering heavy casualties while Li Ming Hai’s side remained undamaged.</p>
<p>For the start, Li Ming Hai’s group had absolute superiority over Gu Jian Xin’s people.</p>
<p>The battle had already started, but Li Ming Hai did not rush to take action, instead just staring at Gu Jian Xin and the two women next to him with a solemn look on his face.</p>
<p>It seemed that this man and two women in front of him were opponents worthy of him taking seriously.</p>
<p>He didn’t move, but Gu Jian Xin, whose side was clearly weaker, naturally didn’t dare to act rashly, only able to watch his subordinates fall one by one in frustration.</p>
<p>After a long silence, Li Ming Hai said faintly, “Young Union Master, do you want to take your own life or do you need this old master to send you on your way?”</p>
<p>“Old dog, you think you’ve already defeated this Young Master?” Gu Jian Xin shouted coldly.</p>
<p>Li Ming Hai slowly shook his head, “Since this Li dared to appear here, naturally he is fully prepared. Young Union Master is indeed a dragon among men, with your Universe Sword Body and your Left and Right Sword Servants who have cultivated together with you since childhood, you are truly extremely difficult to deal with, but… Young Union Master has not arrived at the Origin King Realm, after all. If you had already reached the Origin King Realm, this old master would definitely not be your opponent. Unfortunately, Young Union Master is destined to be unable to escape today.”</p>
<p>“Whether I can escape this crisis today or not, you will know after you try,” Gu Jian Xin roared as he summoned a white long sword into his hand. Sword light surrounding his body, he soared up from the deck!</p>
<p>This sword light was like a rising sun covering the earth, brilliant and majestic.</p>
<p>When he moved, the two women who had been standing behind him also moved. Like Gu Jian Xin, they summoned their swords, released brilliant sword light from their bodies, and followed after Gu Jian Xin.</p>
<p>Different from Gu Jian Xin, however, the sword light these two females emitted manifested as a great crescent moon and a sea of shimmering stars.</p>
<p>The three sword lights rapidly merged into one and exuded a shocking momentum that far surpassed what an Origin Returning Realm master should be able to. A long sword light cut through the void and slashed towards Li Ming Hai in the next instant!</p>
<p>Li Ming Hai’s eyes flashed as he was truly shocked by the might of Gu Jian Xin’s Secret Technique, calling out loud, “Sun, Moon, and Stars, the Three Swords Brilliance Secret Technique is truly deserving of its reputation! With just this, Young Union Master can already be considered invincible in the Origin Returning Realm! Unfortunately… your Left and Right Sword Servants are slightly worse than your own, and you are not an Origin King. Let this old master show you just how big the gap between the Origin Realm and the Origin King Realm is!”</p>
<p>Saying so, an invisible force spread out from Li Ming Hai’s body.</p>
<p>Domain!</p>
<p>Li Ming Hai had broken through to the Origin King Realm over five hundred years ago and could already be considered an established master in this realm. Even if he had no hope of advancing his cultivation higher in the future, and his Domain was not that strong, in the end, it was still a Domain!</p>
<p>An Origin Returning Realm cultivator who was enveloped in a Domain was destined to be completely suppressed, unable to resist.</p>
<p>However, Li Ming Hai’s Domain was actually unable to stop Gu Jian Xin’s trio. From the sword light of these three, a new force emerged suddenly and easily broke through the Li Ming Hai Domain suppression.</p>
<p>Li Ming Hai’s eyes shrank as he shouted in a low voice, “Bright Sea Domain Dividing Mirror! To think Union Master gave you this treasure!”</p>
<p>The Bright Sea Domain Dividing Mirror was an Origin King Grade artifact, and after being activated, it could nullify the effects of an Origin King’s Domain to a large extent. If the opponent wasn’t strong enough, it was even possible for this mirror to shatter their Domain entirely.</p>
<p>This strange treasure was quite famous throughout the Star Field; after all, artifacts that could resist Domain were extremely rare.</p>
<p>With the help of this treasure, Gu Jian Xin and his two Sword Servants weren’t suppressed by Li Ming Hai’s Domain and were able to send their attack towards him.</p>
<p>Facing the Sun, Moon, and Stars Three Swords Brilliance Secret Technique, Li Ming Hai didn’t dare act carelessly. Flipping his wrist, the long spear artifact which he had used to attack Yang Kai before appeared again and he began pouring his Saint Qi into it. A shocking force condensed at the tip of the spear as Li Ming Hai flew forward to meet Gu Jian Xin’s trio in close combat.</p>
<p>The clank of metal rang out instantly.</p>
<p>Sword and spear shadows flooded a massive region as the four figures of Li Ming Hai and Gu Jian Xin’s trio were engulfed by brilliant flashes of light.</p>
<p>In the distance, Yang Kai stared at all of this in amazement, an expression of surprise on his face.</p>
<p>Being able to compete with an Origin King with just an Origin Returning Realm cultivation was not something that could normally be achieved, but Gu Jian Xin had done just that. Even though he was drawing strength from the two women behind him, it was clear he wouldn’t be suppressed any time soon.</p>
<p>Moreover, the cultivation of those two women was obviously inferior to Gu Jian Xin, both of them seemingly just Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators; however, it was also clear that these three had cultivated some kind of profound Secret Technique that allowed them to consolidate their strength and exert a force far beyond that of an ordinary Origin Realm master.</p>
<p>[This Young Union Master of Sword Union was quite impressive!]</p>
<p>When the battle between the two sides started, Yang Kai had already left his hiding place and stealthily approached the battlefield to observe more closely.</p>
<p>Eighty percent of his attention was focused on Li Ming Hai as he looked for an opportunity to launch a sneak attack.</p>
<p>To deal with an Origin King like Li Ming Hai, if the right timing was not grasped, it would only result in alerting the enemy, so Yang Kai had to wait patiently.</p>
<p>Originally, he was a little worried that Gu Jian Xin and the others would be defeated in a single blow, but now, it seemed like this Young Union Master could actually fight on for some time.</p>
<p>While observing the fight, Yang Kai noticed a few streaks of light escaping towards the Asteroid Sea.</p>
<p>Obviously, the battlefield had begun to expand, with some cultivators trying to escape, and this Asteroid Sea, which was filled with obstacles, was undoubtedly the best place to escape to.</p>
<p>Two weaker cultivators appeared to be fleeing, and from the outline of their figures, they were probably women. At the same time, a cultivator from Li Ming Hai’s side was chasing after them.</p>
<p>Judging from the aura fluctuations, the two escaping women were Third-Order Saint Kings. Such cultivations really had no use in this kind of battle.</p>
<p>The cultivator chasing behind them was a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm master, and with the vast gap in their strengths, it was nothing less than a miracle these two women had even managed to escape this far.</p>
<p>Because of Li Ming Hai’s order not to leave anyone alive, the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm master didn’t intend to let the two women go and hurriedly chased after them, closing the gap between them rapidly.</p>
<p>The relationship between these two women was obviously close, as even when they were fleeing, they didn’t abandon one another and kept guarding each other tightly. What made Yang Kai feel helpless though, was that the direction they were moving towards was actually where he was hiding.</p>
<p>If nothing unexpected happened, they would fly past him within a few breaths.</p>
<p>Letting out a sigh, Yang Kai prepared to take action.</p>
<p>A moment later, the two women who were escaping flew past the asteroid where Yang Kai was hiding. At such a close distance, and with the two women already looking for suitable hiding places, they naturally found Yang Kai right away.</p>
<p>When their eyes met, Yang Kai was stunned for a moment while the two women on the opposite side were also stupefied.</p>
<p>In the next instant, the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator who had been chasing them arrived though and sent out a palm towards the two frozen women.</p>
<p>Judging by the power of this attack, even if these two women resisted with all their strength, they would probably be seriously injured at best.</p>
<p>However, the palm the man sent out suddenly collapsed half-way to its target.</p>
<p>“What happened?” The Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator who had been chasing the pair of women was startled, but before he could react, he saw a golden light flash in front of him and vaguely felt a golden thread-like object cut through his neck.</p>
<p>The Saint Qi he used to protect himself was like paper in front of this golden thread, unable to play any effect at all. After a slight stinging pain, the cultivator’s vision grew dim and faded into darkness.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1737, He Zao, He Miao</h2>
<p>In the Asteroid Sea, Yang Kai looked at the two women standing nearby in amazement.</p>
<p>These two women were undoubtedly more surprised than Yang Kai though. When the Origin Returning Realm master who was chasing them died all of a sudden, the two women screamed and turned around, wanting to see who it was that saved them.</p>
<p>Seeing none of their allies nearby though, the two women finally turned their eyes back to Yang Kai as they had a fairly good guess what had just transpired. But despite knowing in their hearts what the truth was, their beautiful eyes still showed incredible shock.</p>
<p>“What are you dawdling for? Come here quickly!” Yang Kai called out in a low voice while beckoning to them.</p>
<p>Only then did the two women come back to their senses, exchange a glance, and quickly hurried over to a spot ten metres away from Yang Kai while eyeing him suspiciously, their expressions wavering in uncertainty.</p>
<p>Yang Kai looked at them with a grin and said teasingly, “What’s wrong? After only a few years you don’t recognize me anymore?”</p>
<p>Hearing his words, the two women gasped fiercely and confirmed the guess in their hearts was not wrong, but because of this, they felt more and more shocked, the taller of the two covering her mouth as she called out hesitantly, “Yang Kai?”</p>
<p>“Is it really you? Did you kill that person just now? When did you become so powerful? Why are you here in the first place?” The other woman, who seemed to be younger, quickly spat a flurry of questions before suddenly becoming alert again and asking, “Are you with Li Ming Hai?”</p>
<p>As soon as she began speaking, she seemed unable to stop, leaving Yang Kai no gap to answer her questions.</p>
<p>The older woman observed Yang Kai seriously for a moment before slowly shaking her head, “Little Sister, don’t talk nonsense. If he was with Li Ming Hai, why would he bother helping us just now?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai chuckled, looking at the younger woman and teasing, “He Miao, seems you are still as scatterbrained as before.”</p>
<p>He Miao heard this, and her face turned red as she shyly said, “I’m sorry, I was just too frightened.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright,” Yang Kai smiled lightly as he observed the two women and said with nostalgia. “I didn’t expect that we would meet again in such a place after a few dozen years.”</p>
<p>These two women were the very same ones Yang Kai had first met when he entered the Star Field, He Zao and He Miao.</p>
<p>After escaping from the floating continent all those years ago, they had never met one another. So, upon seeing them here, Yang Kai was also quite surprised. But after thinking about it carefully, Yang Kai recalled that these two sisters, He Zao and He Miao, were disciples from Sword Union, so while unlikely, it wasn’t impossible for them to be here.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, being caught up in this kind of incident, it seemed these two sisters had quite the bad luck.</p>
<p>“En, it’s been many years since we last met,” He Zao sighed, “I didn’t expect you to be so powerful now. You killed that person just now, right?”</p>
<p>“En.”</p>
<p>Seeing Yang Kai admit it, even though they had their suspicions, the two sisters were still a little speechless.</p>
<p>When they met Yang Kai for the first time, Yang Kai was nothing but a First-Order Saint, and even their own cultivations were higher than him at the Third-Order and Second-Order Saint Realm.</p>
<p>After thirty years, the two sisters had used their excellent aptitude and hard work to rapidly reach the Third-Order Saint King Realm.</p>
<p>But compared to Yang Kai, their achievement seemed completely insufficient!</p>
<p>Being able to kill a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm master instantly, even under the premise of a sneak attack, proved that Yang Kai was at least an Origin Realm cultivator himself! And most likely… a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master!</p>
<p>The moment when Yang Kai showed his hand, He Zao felt an energy fluctuation not weaker than the Young Union Master Gu Jian Xin.</p>
<p>Both sisters were deeply shocked.</p>
<p>Suddenly, He Zao’s expression changed again and she asked solemnly, “Yang Kai, can you please help us?”</p>
<p>“With what?”</p>
<p>“Please save our Honoured Master!”</p>
<p>“Your Honoured Master?” Yang Kai frowned, but quickly realized that He Zao should be referring to that beautiful woman Yue Xi!</p>
<p>When they were trapped on the floating continent that year, the Honoured Master of the He Zao and He Mao sisters, Yue Xi, was also there. Yang Kai had some dealings with her, but they had not been very pleasant. Because Yang Kai’s birthplace was too remote and his cultivation wasn’t high, Yue Xi had looked down on him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Yang Kai also killed Yue Xi’s other disciple at that time, causing her to bear open hostility towards him.</p>
<p>But later, Yue Xi’s perception of Yang Kai improved for various reasons and ultimately, with his help, she and her two disciples were able to successfully escape the floating continent. On top of that, it turned out that her last disciple wasn’t a good thing, and his death wasn’t worth pitying.</p>
<p>“Yue Xi is here too?” Yang Kai glanced towards the battlefield again, only to see a large area of brilliant flashes and chaotic energy fluctuations, making it impossible for him to tell who was fighting from this distance.</p>
<p>An anxious look appeared on He Zao’s face, “We were only able to escape thanks to Honoured Master delaying the enemy, but her situation is not optimistic. I don’t know how long she can hold on, Yang Kai, can you…”</p>
<p>She obviously knew that her request was a bit excessive. The battlefield was in a state of chaos right now and even an Origin King Realm master was fighting. Anyone who entered haphazardly would certainly be at great risk.</p>
<p>However, He Zao was just a Third-Order Saint King and was unable to help Yue Xi at all, so she could only swallow her embarrassment and ask Yang Kai for help.</p>
<p>“Big Brother Yang…” He Miao also called out in a pitiful voice with a pleading look on her face. Her previous liveliness had all but vanished and she now appeared quite helpless and forlorn. Thinking that the Honoured Master who raised her might fall in that battlefield, He Miao almost burst into tears.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of their experience when escaping from the floating continent, or perhaps because Yang Kai just killed a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator with a single blow, the two sisters had inexplicable confidence in him and believed that if he took action, their Honoured Master could be saved.</p>
<p>Yue Xi had a bad impression of Yang Kai at the beginning, but she had only the warmest of intentions for her two disciples, otherwise, she would not have taken such great risks to delay the enemy in order to let He Zao and He Miao escape.</p>
<p>Yang Kai brow furrowed deeply.</p>
<p>Seeing this, He Zao and He Miao did not dare to urge him and simply waited anxiously.</p>
<p>After a short silence, Yang Kai raised his eyes and said seriously, “The main reason why I am hiding here is to launch a sneak attack against that Li Ming Hai!”</p>
<p>He Zao and He Miao suddenly exclaimed as they stared at Yang Kai in shock, an incredible brilliance flashing across their beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>An Origin Returning Realm master wanting to sneak attack an Origin King! This was like an ant hiding in the shadows, then stretching out its leg to try to trip an elephant, a completely unbelievable scenario.</p>
<p>“I’m serious. When I passed by here before, I was attacked by him, which is why I remained!” Yang Kai looked at them lightly. “So it’s not convenient for me to come forward now.”</p>
<p>The brilliance in the sisters’ eyes quickly dimmed.</p>
<p>“However, since He Miao calls me big brother, I can’t just sit back and watch,” Yang Kai chuckled.</p>
<p>He Miao looked at Yang Kai in pleasant surprise, and the pale, bloodless complexion on her face was replaced with a shy blush.</p>
<p>“Come out!” Yang Kai suddenly called, and in the next moment, a stream of fiery red energy burst from his body before quickly condensing into a human figure.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, a glamorous woman with an exotic figure appeared strangely in front of He Zao and He Miao.</p>
<p>This glamorous woman had fiery red hair which looked like the most gorgeous of burning flames and her clothes were all crimson red in colour. At such a close distance, both He Zao and He Miao felt an astonishing and dangerous energy fluctuation coming from this woman.</p>
<p>This was an aura of pure destructive power!</p>
<p>“Master, what are your orders?” As soon as the woman appeared, she asked Yang Kai respectfully, without even looking at He Zao or He Miao, as if in her eyes, the two women were like air and could be ignored.</p>
<p>“Accompany and protect them!” Yang Kai pointed to He Zao and He Miao.</p>
<p>The woman finally glanced towards the two sisters and nodded lightly.</p>
<p>“Yang Kai, she is…” He Zao asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>“My friend, you can call her Liu Yan!” Yang Kai replied.</p>
<p>Even Yang Kai did not notice that when he introduced Liu Yan to the two sisters this way, her beautiful eyes flashed with a subtle but extremely bright light.</p>
<p>“So it is Elder Sister Liu Yan. We will be imposing on Elder Sister then,” Although He Zao saw that Liu Yan didn’t have a physical form, the other party’s sentience was clearly quite high, so she did not dare act negligently.</p>
<p>“Liu Yan will obey Master’s orders!” Liu Yan didn’t say much, replying promptly and concisely.</p>
<p>“En, go,” Yang Kai nodded faintly at Liu Yan. Liu Yan nodded back before her body transformed back into a stream of fiery light and dove into He Zao’s body before she could even react.</p>
<p>He Zao exclaimed in shock, but soon, a look of pleasant surprise appeared on her face.</p>
<p>Because she felt that there was a terrifying power now hidden within her body. Although this power was not under her control, and even brought her some discomfort from its heat, with this power, she was confident she could save her Honoured Master!</p>
<p>Turning a look filled with gratitude to Yang Kai she bowed her head, “Thank you!”</p>
<p>“Be careful!” Yang Kai smiled lightly.</p>
<p>The He Zao and He Miao sisters looked at each other quickly before turning around and flying towards the battlefield.</p>
<p>With Liu Yan’s assistance, the safety of the two sisters was assured. Since she swallowed and refined the Heavenly Thunder Fire in Brilliant Flame Sect, not only had Liu Yan’s sentience evolved greatly, her strength had also soared!</p>
<p>Before swallowing the Heavenly Thunder Fire, she was able to fight against Third-Order Origin Realm masters.</p>
<p>After swallowing it, she was now capable of competing with an ordinary First-Order Origin King.</p>
<p>On the battlefield, there was only one Origin King, Li Ming Hai, so no one else was Liu Yan’s opponent. It was conceivable that once He Zao and He Miao returned with Liu Yan, the entire course of the battle would shift dramatically, flipping which side was overwhelming the other.</p>
<p>Collecting his thoughts, Yang Kai refocused his attention on Gu Jian Xin and Li Ming Hai.</p>
<p>Their battle was the fiercest in the entire battlefield and gave off the greatest energy fluctuations, so it was easy for Yang Kai to find them at a glance.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin and his Left and Right Sword Servants were still fighting together as one, wrapping themselves in three the image of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, releasing potent Sword Qi waves towards Li Ming Hai who used his long spear to nimbly fight back against them.</p>
<p>The two sides seemed to be locked in an even battle so far!</p>
<h2>Chapter 1738, You Won’t Have The Chance</h2>
<p>After observing for a moment though, Yang Kai could tell that Gu Jian Xin’s side was starting to have difficulties.</p>
<p>When he and the two women performed this Secret Technique before, the Sun, Moon, and Star Sword Brilliances were extremely bright, with a radiant sun, bright crescent moon, and sea of stars supporting and enhancing one another, but now, these three manifestations were slowly beginning to dim and their aura had become somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Li Ming Hai’s strength had not diminished.</p>
<p>It seemed that, if nothing happened, Gu Jian Xin would ultimately lose.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the fierce fighting between them, Yang Kai also began to draw closer.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin being able to fight until now was already quite impressive, and even if at that last moment, he was unable to cause heavy losses to Li Ming Hai, he should at least be able to wear him down and draw his full attention.</p>
<p>As long as Li Ming Hai’s attention was diverted, Yang Kai could take the opportunity to attack.</p>
<p>Soon, Yang Kai had approached to within ten kilometres of the battle’s perimeter! This was the limit of how close he could get, any closer and Li Ming Hai would definitely notice him.</p>
<p>Just after Yang Kai concealed himself once again, Li Ming Hai’s shout rang out, “Young Union Master, if this is the extent of your ability then this old master will be sending you to the afterlife today!”</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin did not respond, but it was not clear whether he disdained to do so, or he did not have the spare capacity to. The sword light he and his Left and Right Sword Servants were emitting suddenly bloomed, transforming into a massive sword thousands of metres long and swiftly chopped towards Li Ming Hai’s head.</p>
<p>Li Ming Hai saw this and laughed loudly, “Paltry tricks! Even now you insist on this futile resistance, Young Union Master?”</p>
<p>As soon as these words fell, the Soul Breaker Spear in Li Ming Hai’s hand flicked and from its tip a profound dark light shot out to meet the massive sword light.</p>
<p>The white and black rays of light collided and burst into a massive explosion that sent out a wave of powerful ripples. These ripples of energy were violent enough to force all the surrounding Origin Returning Realm masters in the vicinity to retreat.</p>
<p>The two opposite energies clashed in the void, but soon, the stalemate was broken.</p>
<p>Li Ming Hai had used some kind of Secret Technique to greatly increase the intensity of his dark light and directly suppressed the sword light.</p>
<p>A loud bang resounded.</p>
<p>The sword light burst to pieces and a muffled snort echoed as three shadows shot out in different directions.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin’s face was pale and there were clear traces of blood at the corners of his lips; obviously, he had suffered some injuries.</p>
<p>His Left and Right Sword Servants were in even worse condition. These two attendants had cultivated together with Gu Jian Xin from when he was a child until now, and as auxiliaries who supported him, their cultivation had always been one step lower than for Gu Jian Xin’s.</p>
<p>As a result, the two Sword Servants suffered greater damage in this exchange. The Left and Right Sword Servants coughed up blood as their tender bodies tumbled uncontrollably, their robes dyed a dark crimson-red.</p>
<p>Li Ming Hai’s eyes flashed a ruthless light, but instead of taking this opportunity to take Gu Jian Xin’s life, his figure flickered and he thrust his spear towards the Left Sword Servant who was closest to him.</p>
<p>As an Origin King, his combat experience was naturally extremely rich, and although this might be the best time to kill Gu Jian Xin, given the latter’s extraordinary identity, and the fact that he was carrying a famous artifact like the Bright Sea Domain Dividing Mirror, there was no telling what other kinds of life-saving treasures he had on him.</p>
<p>Li Ming Hai was not confident he could kill Gu Jian Xin in a single blow.</p>
<p>As such, he chose to attack the Left Sword Servant. As long as the Left Sword Servant died, Gu Jian Xin would no longer be able to use his Sun, Moon, And Stars Three Swords Brilliance Secret Technique. Once that happened, Li Ming Hai was confident he could slowly wear down Gu Jian Xin until he died!</p>
<p>Witnessing Li Ming Hai’s actions, the Right Sword Servant’s beautiful eyes filled with determination and anxiety, hurriedly stabilizing her tumbling figure before pushing her Saint Qi and gathering her sword light again as she flew towards the Left Sword Servant.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin also let out a near-hysterical shout, “Ling Yue, watch out!”</p>
<p>As he shouted, he too desperately rushed over.</p>
<p>Three figures rapidly moved towards the Left Sword Servant, shrinking the distance between them in an instant.</p>
<p>A sardonic grin appeared at the corner of Li Ming Hai’s lips and when he felt that the timing was just right, he suddenly whirled around and threw the Soul Breaker Spear in his hand towards the Right Sword Servant.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>Only now did they understand that Li Ming Hai’s initial goal was not the Left Sword Servant, but the Right Sword Servant!</p>
<p>Or perhaps, he had reacted in the moment after discovering a better target…</p>
<p>After the Soul Breaker Spear flew out of Li Ming Hai’s hand, it transformed into a giant python which opened its blood-red mouth and bit towards the Right Sword Servant, as if wanting to swallow her whole.</p>
<p>This was a genuine Origin King Grade artifact, not something the Right Sword Servant could handle alone. If she were to take this attack head-on, death was the only possibility.</p>
<p>At that moment, Gu Jian Xin’s body released a flash of brilliance and using some kind of Secret Technique or artifact, he instantly appeared in front of his Right Sword Servant, grabbed hold of her, and placed his body between her and the incoming attack. At the same time, a cyan coloured Artifact Armour that seemed to be composed of numerous tiny scales appeared on Gu Jian Xin’s body.</p>
<p>On the Artifact Armour, flowing runes and light flashed, and at first glance, it was obviously a high-grade defensive artifact. After being activated by Gu Jian Xin’s Saint Qi, the Artifact Armour released a firm energy barrier.</p>
<p>The moment the light barrier formed; Li Ming Hai’s attack reached its target.</p>
<p>The giant python smashed up against Gu Jian Xin’s Artifact Armour.</p>
<p>The bright energy light film dimmed at a speed visible to the naked eye, only managing to persist for two breaths before bursting apart. The python’s remaining power struck Gu Jian Xin’s body at that moment, causing him to fly out while coughing up mouthfuls of blood onto his Right Sword Servant and turning his face pale and bloodless.</p>
<p>“This old master admires Young Union Master’s loving heart and righteousness, but… though you managed to save one, can you save the other as well?” Li Ming Hai’s triumphant voice sounded with a hint of sarcasm and mockery.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin, who was still tumbling flying backwards, fixed his eyes and found that Li Ming Hai was now flying towards the Left Sword Servant again and was condensing his Saint Qi onto his palm.</p>
<p>From that palm, a powerful vortex began to form!</p>
<p>With the power of this vortex, coupled with the innate pressure of an Origin King Realm master, the Left Sword Servant was suppressed to the point where she could not move or put up any resistance.</p>
<p>However, as death befell her, she did not show the slightest worry about her own safety, instead turning her beautiful, worry-filled eyes towards Gu Jian Xin. Seeing that Gu Jian Xin had not been killed and had only suffered a serious injury, her expression relaxed, and her red lips moved lightly.</p>
<p>He could not hear her voice, but Gu Jian Xin knew that she was telling him to escape!</p>
<p>“Li Ming Hai!” Gu Jian Xin roared like a wounded beast, his voice filled with hatred as he echoed through the void, his eyes going completely bloodshot.</p>
<p>“Young Master, you must go!” The Right Sword Servant, who was still being held in Gu Jian Xin’s arms, firmly grasped him, and cried out pleadingly, “Sister Ling Yue would not want you to throw your life away here. As long as you can escape, Sister Ling Yue’s death won’t be in vain!”</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin froze in place as he hesitated about what to do, but in the next instant, the rage-filled expression on his face changed to one of utter astonishment. Immediately, a burst of pleasant surprise flashed across his eyes as his gaze landed behind Li Ming Hai.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin had suddenly discovered that a figure had appeared behind Li Ming Hai at some unknown point. This person was like a ghost, approaching to within ten metres of Li Ming Hai without the old dog Li even noticing.</p>
<p>Immediately, this mysterious young man waved his hand through the air rapidly, sending out a series of pitch-black, crescent-shaped blades that flew towards Li Ming Hai.</p>
<p>Each of these attacks gave off a profound and mysterious power that even from a great distance, Gu Jian Xin was able to clearly sense it.</p>
<p>As soon as this attack was launched, Li Ming Hai noticed and he roared, “Who!”</p>
<p>Hurriedly turning around, Li Ming Hai pushed his palm out towards this unknown assailant.</p>
<p>Shock and excitement filled Gu Jian Xin’s face when he saw Li Ming Hai’s palm fail to fully disperse this wave of attacks, allowing several the black crescent blades to reach his arm.</p>
<p>Suddenly, little pieces of the old dog surnamed Li’s arm vanished!</p>
<p>As if they never existed, they were swallowed by The Void…</p>
<p>When the pain of losing his arm finally registered, Li Ming Hai roared madly as he stretched out his undamaged arm and drew the Soul Breaker Spear back to him. His eyes practically spitting fire, he glared at the young man who attacked him and shouted, “Junior, I’ll make you pay for this!”</p>
<p>“You won’t have the chance!” The young man coldly snorted as he summoned a bladeless, green long sword with a flip of his wrist. The long sword trembled and twisted slightly as it transformed into a giant dark-green dragon that pounced towards Li Ming Hai.</p>
<p>A mighty dragon roar shook the sky as thick Dragon Pressure descended from above, causing Li Ming Hai to let out a strange cry as he quickly pushed the Soul Breaker Spear’s power, transforming it into its giant python form.</p>
<p>The two transformed artifact monsters collided with each other violently, but how could a mere python ever defeat a dragon? After only a brief resistance, the python was destroyed by the dragon!</p>
<p>Li Ming Hai finally showed a look of horror in his eyes as he hurriedly searched for the young man who attacked him, but to his shock, he was unable to find him anywhere! Just as he mysteriously appeared, after summoning this terrifying dragon artifact, the young man had vanished like a ghost.</p>
<p>A thick murderous intent suddenly appeared behind him, causing Li Ming Hai heart to jump and he instinctually released his Domain in an attempt to regain the initiative.</p>
<p>Although their confrontation had been brief, Li Ming Hai had keenly noticed that the young man who attacked him was only a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator. To deal with an Origin Realm cultivator, Domain was undoubtedly the best choice!</p>
<p>Not everyone was like Gu Jian Xin, possessing an extraordinary treasure like the Bright Sea Domain Dividing Mirror that could resist Domain.</p>
<p>Li Ming Hai’s had made the best response possible, but to his shock, the moment his Domain spread out, it was met by a potent Shi, one that was not only unsuppressed by his Domain, but was even able to confront it head-on.</p>
<p>There was a mysterious power integrated into this Shi.</p>
<p>The surrounding space began to collapse, and innumerable tiny Void Cracks began to fill Li Ming Hai’s surroundings, enveloping him in an airtight field!</p>
<p>“Space Force!” Li Ming Hai exclaimed.</p>
<p>At that moment, the giant dark-green dragon that destroyed the giant python rushed over and opened its giant maw to bite towards Li Ming Hai.</p>
<p>Behind him, an icy chill struck Li Ming Hai as an intense murderous washed over him like a tidal wave.</p>
<p>He was completely surrounded, with no way out!</p>
<h2>Chapter 1739, Origin King Displays His Might</h2>
<p>“Old dog Li!” Gu Jian Xin rushed over and released a dazzling sun-like sword light towards Li Ming Hai.</p>
<p>At the same time, the surrounding burst with golden light as hundreds of golden threads slashed through space.</p>
<p>The Void Cracks around Li Ming Hai’s body also rapidly enlarged and traversed towards him.</p>
<p>In that instant, Li Ming Hai was submerged by a myriad of different deadly attacks.</p>
<p>The place where Li Ming Hai stood was instantly enveloped by a dazzling burst of light, blinding all who were nearby and releasing a Heaven destroying and Earth-shattering energy fluctuation.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin flew out again even faster than before, but fortunately, the Right Sword Servant, having anticipated this moment, was there to catch him.</p>
<p>With a loud cough, Gu Jian Xin slumped over into the arms of his Right Sword Servant and sprayed out a thick blood mist.</p>
<p>“Young Master!” The Right Sword Servant cried out as her beautiful eyes filled with worry.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin did not have the luxury to answer as his eyes fixed straight ahead.</p>
<p>He did not know if Li Ming Hai was dead, but the piercing feedback he felt from his sword just now was a clear indication that he had managed to stab Li Ming Hai’s vitals.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his opponent was an Origin King! This was the first time Gu Jian Xin had truly fought an Origin King in a life or death battle, so he was naturally somewhat inexperienced. Before seeing Li Ming Hai’s corpse with his own eyes, he dared not act carelessly.</p>
<p>The brilliant flash of light gradually dissipated, and a figure emerged.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin’s eyes shrank suddenly.</p>
<p>Li Ming Hai!</p>
<p>Even after suffering such a terrifying attack, Li Ming Hai had not died. However, having been struck by such a powerful wave of attacks, Li Ming Hai had been reduced to a dishevelled and embarrassing appearance. His clothes were ragged and the Artifact Armour he had summoned in the nick of time was also clearly destroyed.</p>
<p>What made Gu Jian Xin overjoyed though was that Li Ming Hai’s injuries were obviously not light, with blood leaking from many places and numerous wounds so deep that his bones were showing.</p>
<p>On Li Ming Hai’s face, an expression filled with anger and fear had appeared.</p>
<p>He was truly frightened as he felt the threat of death just now!</p>
<p>Unable to calm his nerves, Li Ming Hai looked around, his gaze only staying on Gu Jian Xin and the Right Sword Servant for a moment before it continued scanning the surrounding void.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Li Ming Hai was not able to achieve anything as he couldn’t discover a single trace of the mysterious young man who attacked him before.</p>
<p>“Junior, this old master will make you pay the price one day!” Li Ming Hai tried to put up a strong front as he shouted before turning into a stream of light and fleeing towards the distance, leaving behind a trail of blood as he flew.</p>
<p>“He must not escape!” Gu Jian Xin shouted towards the void as he gasped for breath.</p>
<p>Just as his voice fell, from somewhere in the void, a multi-coloured burst of light appeared, and a five coloured Sword Qi formed into a giant blade that flashed towards the fleeing Li Ming Hai.</p>
<p>Li Ming Hai was horrified when he felt this approaching attack and hurriedly used a Secret Technique to protect himself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was strong in will but weak in strength, and the method he used was only able to block the five coloured Sword Qi for an instant before it was shattered. The sword wave sliced through Li Ming Hai’s body before disappearing into the distance like a shining comet.</p>
<p>Li Ming Hai’s body froze in place, his eyes wide and unmoving.</p>
<p>The vitality of his body and the light in his eyes quickly dissipated.</p>
<p>A dignified Origin King Realm master died here!</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin, who was watching from a distance, could not figure out the situation. After being severely wounded, he did not dare to act rashly and just continued to stare at Li Ming Hai’s body vigilantly. Soon though, the still-shaken Left Sword Servant flew over and inspected Li Ming Hai before happily flying over to rendezvous with Gu Jian Xin.</p>
<p>When his Left Sword Servant returned, Gu Jian Xin asked eagerly, “How is it?”</p>
<p>“Li Ming Hai is dead!” Left Sword Servant replied.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin exhaled a long breath, his whole figure relaxing as he limply fell into the Right Sword Servant’s embrace as he said with some lingering fear, “Good, good, as long as he’s dead it’s good!”</p>
<p>“Young Master, that person just now…” The Left Sword Servant wore a suspicious look on her face.</p>
<p>“He’s not from our Sword Union,” Gu Jian Xin shook his head, took out some pills from his Space Ring, stuffed them into his mouth, and said, “We can figure it out later, but we need to go support the others first. Old Dog Li brought a lot of masters with him, I am afraid they won’t… huh…”</p>
<p>While Gu Jian Xin spoke, he turned his head and looked towards the distant battlefield and was greeted by a strange scene.</p>
<p>Many of the cultivators from his side were still alive while, on the contrary, Li Ming Hai’s subordinates were almost all dead or severely injured. Gu Jian Xin had been fighting Li Ming Hai just now, so he did not have the time to pay attention to anything else, so this scene came as quite a surprise to him.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin was naturally well aware of the gap in strength between the two sides and knew his side was far weaker than Li Ming Hai’s.</p>
<p>After all, Li Ming Hai had laid an ambush for him here, so how could he not have made appropriate preparations?</p>
<p>This time, Gu Jian Xin was lucky enough to kill Li Ming Hai and keep his life thanks to the help of that noble stranger, but how were his subordinates also able to emerge victoriously?</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin could not believe his eyes.</p>
<p>However, after watching for a while, he finally understood what was happening.</p>
<p>It turned out to be because of Yue Xi and her two Disciples!</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin had met Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Miao before. In any case, the Master and Disciple trio were cultivators who followed him, so although Yue Xi was only a First-Order, she was still an Origin Realm master. Gu Jian Xin naturally had some impression of them.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Master and Disciple trio were leading the charge against the enemy who should be far stronger than them, but it was actually the three of them who were in complete control of the battle.</p>
<p>Whenever a battle erupted, a red light would burst from He Zao’s body and the enemy would inexplicably fall…</p>
<p>[What is that red light?] Gu Jian Xin could not understand it at all. He never knew that there was such an astonishing cultivator hidden amongst his subordinates who was capable of such an incredible feat!</p>
<p>The overall situation had been determined over there, with Li Ming Hai’s side’s defeat being inevitable. The few survivors from the original ambushers were now fleeing while Gu Jian Xin’s subordinates were in pursuit.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin felt relieved and took a deep breath before cupping his fists and calling out to the void, “Dare I ask honoured friend’s name? For this life saving kindness, this Gu is extremely grateful. If it is convenient, could friend come out and meet with me?”</p>
<p>“Haha, Young Union Master is too polite,” A hearty laughter came from nearby and Gu Jian Xin turned his head to find a familiar young man, who he might have met before but could not put his finger on it, was now slowly walking over to him.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin’s eyes flashed as his Left and Right Sword Servants looked at Yang Kai with curiosity and gratitude.</p>
<p>If it were not for Yang Kai’s sudden appearance, while it didn’t matter if they had died, it was certain their Young Master would have perished as well. As such, the Left and Right Sword Servants were extremely grateful towards Yang Kai, who had turned the tide of the battle, and their eyes reflected a kind light as they observed him.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin also observed Yang Kai carefully and confirmed that the other part was truly just a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator as he had detected before. But the combat power this young man had shown before was clearly far beyond his realm.</p>
<p>Perhaps, even if he were to join forces with his Left and Right Sword Servants, they would not necessarily be this young man’s opponents! Gu Jian Xin was thoroughly shocked.</p>
<p>As Sword Union’s Young Union Master, from infancy until now, he had received resources and training beyond anything ordinary people could dream of. He also wasn’t a second-generation child with no ambition, he had lofty ideals and a broad future before him, so he had never slacked in his cultivation over the years.</p>
<p>He thought that there were few of his generation in the Star Field worthy to be his opponent within the Origin Returning Realm!</p>
<p>But today, he saw one! A cultivator of the same generation who made him feel intense pressure.</p>
<p>“Third Young Master Xue Yue?” Gu Jian Xin asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face twitched visibly as he spat, “Do I look like such a womanly boy?”</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin smiled awkwardly as his Left and Right Sword Servants also couldn’t help tittering lightly, the more playful looking Left Sword Servant even giggling out loud, but feeling that she was acting indiscreetly she quickly used her jade hand to cover her mouth.</p>
<p>“Sorry, this Gu and Third Young Master Xue Yue have not met for many, many years,” Gu Jian Xin explained. “Then is Your Excellency Zi Dong?”</p>
<p>“Who?” Yang Kai asked in confusion.</p>
<p>“Purple Star’s Young Master…” Gu Jian Xin was at a loss.</p>
<p>“Ho, it seems Young Union Master believes only Young Masters from other great forces are qualified to speak with you?” Yang Kai looked at Gu Jian Xin with a smile.</p>
<p>“This Gu meant no such thing,” Gu Jian Xin said solemnly, “It’s just that this Gu finds it difficult to imagine that someone could become so strong without the support of such a great force! If I have shown any impropriety, please forgive me.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” Yang Kai smiled lightly, “I am not a person from any great force. My name is Yang Kai.”</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin was taken aback as he truly had never heard the name Yang Kai before. What was certain was that he was definitely not from any great force, but this reality only shocked Gu Jian Xin even more.</p>
<p>Cupping his fists solemnly again, he politely called, “So it is Brother Yang.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded lightly before glancing towards the distance where the other battlefield had settled down. With Liu Yan’s help, how could Li Ming Hai subordinates have any chance to escape? All of them were executed without a single one being able to escape.</p>
<p>“Brother Yang, this Gu has a question, but I don’t know if it’s appropriate to ask,” Gu Jian Xin suddenly spoke.</p>
<p>“When I passed by here before, Li Ming Hai attacked me by surprise, so I decided to lie in ambush here to return the favour,” Yang Kai glanced at him and answered before the question was asked.</p>
<p>“Brother Yang is brave, bold, and strong!” Gu Jian Xin brow jumped.</p>
<p>An ordinary Origin Returning Realm cultivator who was sneak attacked by an Origin King and managed to survive would normally run as far away as possible. They may gnash their teeth and curse violently to vent their anger, but very few would dare do what Yang Kai did, daring to come back and launch his own sneak attack.</p>
<p>Those who acted this way either didn’t fear the Heavens or had something to rely on that gave them confidence in success.</p>
<p>And from the results, it was obviously Yang Kai belonged to the latter category!</p>
<p>It seemed he had not used his full strength in the previous battle.</p>
<p>Moreover, this Yang Kai was obviously a man who sought revenge for any grievance he suffered!</p>
<h2>Chapter 1740, Travel Together</h2>
<p>“Since it was supposed to be a sneak attack, why didn’t Brother Yang wait for a better opportunity? For example, when old dog Li killed me and relaxed his guard? Brother Yang could have chosen to take action at that time and saved himself some effort,” Gu Jian Xin asked.</p>
<p>“Needing to put in more effort doesn’t mean I couldn’t kill him,” Yang Kai smiled confidently. “What Young Union Master wants to ask is why I saved you, yes?”</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin nodded.</p>
<p>“It would be a pity for a man who is willing to sacrifice himself for his woman to die just like that,” Yang Kai replied.</p>
<p>Earlier, Gu Jian Xin had personally resisted Li Ming Hai’s blow for his Right Sword Servant, and Yang Kai was clear on how dangerous that was. If anything had gone wrong, Gu Jian Xin and his Right Sword Servant would have both died together.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had also fought side by side with Su Yan before against a master like Luo Hai, so he very much approved of Gu Jian Xin’s approach.</p>
<p>A man who was willing to go so far for his beloved was definitely not a cunning and sinister character.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin was stunned.</p>
<p>The Left and Right Sword Servants also blushed slightly as they glanced towards Gu Jian Xin with clear affection reflected in their beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>Soon though, Gu Jian Xin let out a hearty laugh and the last traces of vigilance in his eyes finally dissipated, saying with great heroic spirit, “It seems that Brother Yang is also a man among men. En, this Gu being able to encounter Brother Yang here is truly an honour!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai touched his nose and said, “The other reason is… I am acquainted with someone from your Sword Union.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Brother Yang knows someone from our Sword Union?” Gu Jian Xin asked with joy.</p>
<p>Without even mentioning that he now owed Yang Kai a live-saving grace, Gu Jian Xin felt it quite enthusiastic about Yang Kai and wanted to make friends with him. As such, hearing that Yang Kai had some contact with Sword Union already naturally made Gu Jian Xin incredibly happy.</p>
<p>“Who is it that Brother Yang knows?”</p>
<p>“They’re coming over now,” Yang Kai gestured.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin turned his head and soon found that the Yue Xi Master and Disciple trio, who had shined so brightly in battle, were flying over.</p>
<p>“So it’s them!” Gu Jian Xin was genuinely surprised.</p>
<p>He thought that the one Yang Kai knew was some top master among his subordinates, but it actually turned out to be these three.</p>
<p>Soon after, Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Miao crossed the short distance separating them and saluted Gu Jian Xin before asking about his situation. After learning that the Young Union Master was fine, they all visibly relaxed.</p>
<p>“Big Brother Yang,” He Zao and He Miao turned to Yang Kai next. This time, they had relied on Yang Kai’s help to turn danger into safety, so they did not treat him as an outsider and called out to him charmingly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded slightly, stretched out his hand, and took back a brilliant red light from He Zao’s body, sucking it into his palm.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Yang Kai. If not for your help, we would all have perished here. This Mistress and her Disciples are eternally grateful!” Yue Xi sincerely thanked him.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not stand on ceremony and calmly accepted the other side’s gratitude.</p>
<p>“Brother Yang is actually acquainted with Lady Yue and her disciples, it seems all of this was truly predestined,” Gu Jian Xin laughed loudly. “If Brother Yang doesn’t object, why not come aboard this Gu’s Starship to rest? This Gu will offer the finest entertainment.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai heard this but did not immediately agree.</p>
<p>The reason why he stayed here was mainly because he wanted to launch a sneak attack on Li Ming Hai, so now that the latter was dead, he had no particular reason to remain.</p>
<p>Seeing him go silent, Gu Jian Xin did not try to urge him, but He Zao and He Miao both stared at Yang Kai pleadingly, as if hoping he would agree.</p>
<p>“Might I ask what Young Union Master’s destination is for this trip?” After a while, Yang Kai looked up and asked.</p>
<p>“Brother Yang can just call me Brother Gu, being referred to as Young Union Master seems a bit stiff,” Gu Jian Xin smiled. “As for Brother Yang’s question, this Gu is heading towards Azure Tree Star this time.”</p>
<p>“Azure Tree Star?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it is one of the Cultivation Stars under the jurisdiction of my Sword Union and about a month’s journey away from here.”</p>
<p>“Is that so….” Yang Kai thought for a while before coming to a conclusion and nodding, “Since Brother Gu has made such a generous invitation, then this Yang will be imposing on you.”</p>
<p>Seeing Yang Kai agree, Gu Jian Xin’s eyes brightened, and he seemed to be extremely happy. Walking forward, he put his arm around Yang Kai’s shoulder and led him towards the Starship, acting like old friends who had just reunited.</p>
<p>Under the attack of Li Ming Hai and his group, one of the three Starships had been destroyed while another had been crippled, leaving just the largest Starship Gu Jian Xin was sailing aboard intact. Although this Starship was also somewhat damaged, it only needed some minor repairs before it was able to get underway.</p>
<p>Aboard the Starship, Gu Jian Xin arranged for quarters for Yang Kai before excusing himself so he could heal his injuries. Gu Jian Xin had just fought an intense battle against Li Ming Hai, and although he had not suffered any fatal injuries, he had several heavy wounds. This damage needed to be addressed quickly with pills and meditation.</p>
<p>Yang Kai naturally understood this and did not mind.</p>
<p>After a day of repairs, the Starship got underway again.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was given an extremely luxurious room by Gu Jian Xin, one that was not only large but ornately decorated, with hundreds of luminous stones providing a soft and warm light not inferior to natural sunlight.</p>
<p>There was also an incense burner in the room which a calming fragrance wafted from.</p>
<p>Yang Kai also had his reasons for accepting Gu Jian Xin’s invitation.</p>
<p>He had travelled quite a distance on his own while arranging Space Arrays on a few Dead Stars as transfer points. Now, he needed to connect this network to a real Cultivation Star, otherwise, the cultivators from Shadowed Star would have no end destination.</p>
<p>According to Yang Kai’s own observations from his Star Chart, this Azure Tree Star was quite a good Cultivation Star.</p>
<p>If Ye Xi Yun and the others could travel through the Space Array network to Azure Tree Star, they could take advantage of the World Energy and World Principles there to attempt to break through to the Origin King Realm.</p>
<p>Another reason was that he did not have many Space Spirit Crystals left.</p>
<p>Although Ye Xi Yun and the others had collected almost the entire supply of Space Spirit Crystals available on Shadowed Star for him before he left, the amount required to arrange a Cross-Cultivation Star Space Array was simply too great.</p>
<p>The Space Spirit Crystal he had on hand was only enough to arrange one more Space Array!</p>
<p>He needed to find a way to acquire more.</p>
<p>Azure Tree Star was a Cultivation Star under the jurisdiction of Sword Union, and Yang Kai now had a friendly relationship with Gu Jian Xin, the Young Union Master, so he could use this opportunity to acquire more Space Spirit Crystals.</p>
<p>Before doing so though, Yang Kai could take a trip back to the Ore Star to see if Qian Tong, Ye Xi Yun and the others had found a Space Spirit Crystal mineral lode. If so, it would save him some trouble.</p>
<p>Sitting down in his room, Yang Kai took inventory of his gains.</p>
<p>He had not actually acquired much though; after all, he had only killed three people in the conflict. Needless to say, Zhang Fu and Liu Dong’s Space Ring basically had nothing of interest to Yang Kai, all of their items would likely wind up in High Heaven Sect’s storehouse.</p>
<p>As for Li Ming Hai’s Space Ring, there was a lot of wealth stored inside.</p>
<p>Of note was the Origin King Grade Soul Breaker Spear artifact which had now fallen into Yang Kai’s hands.</p>
<p>Even considering the entire Star Field, Origin King Grade artifacts were rare things that could not be purchased at will! However, Yang Kai was not too excited about this artifact as among the people he knew, there wasn’t anyone suited to using it.</p>
<p>For now, he could only set it aside.</p>
<p>While taking inventory, a knock suddenly came from his door and after a moment of surprise, Yang Kai called out casually, “Come in.”</p>
<p>The door opened and two beautiful figures walked in one after the other.</p>
<p>“Big Brother Yang!” He Miao greeted him crisply before setting down a few trays on a nearby table together with He Zao.</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced over and found that these trays were filled with exquisite delicacies and wine, but he did not pay these things too much mind. At his level of strength, even the finest of foods and wines were nothing but luxuries to stimulate the palate without much practical purpose. Only some special dishes were capable of improving his strength directly.</p>
<p>“Are we disturbing you?” He Zao was a little more mature and when she saw Yang Kai wearing such a casual appearance, she asked worriedly.</p>
<p>“No,” Yang Kai smiled lightly before motioning, “Have a seat.”</p>
<p>“We couldn’t,” He Zao waved her hands, “We are here to serve you, standing is more appropriate. If you have any instructions, please don’t hesitate to tell us.”</p>
<p>“Gu Jian Xin asked you to come?” Yang Kai raised his brow.</p>
<p>“En,” He Zao lowered her eyes respectfully, while on the other hand, He Miao looked around curiously.</p>
<p>Obviously, she had never entered this type of luxurious room before.</p>
<p>“Then first sit down, this is an order,” Yang Kai smiled.</p>
<p>He Zao hesitated for a moment before nodding lightly and taking a seat with her sister. After assuming an extremely respectful posture, however, He Zao saw He Miao’s restless appearance and shot her a vicious glance.</p>
<p>He Miao spat out her delicate tongue before finally settling down as well.</p>
<p>“It seems that every time I meet you, your situation is quite bad,” Yang Kai said with a smile.</p>
<p>The first time he met these two sisters in the Star Field, they were being chased by Purple Star’s cultivator. Just now, they had been ambushed by Li Ming Hai here. Although the situation was different, the circumstances were quite similar.</p>
<p>Hearing Yang Kai’s joke, He Zao’s face flushed while He Miao muttered, “We should be the ones saying that.”</p>
<p>“He Miao!” He Zao glared at her little sister immediately, causing He Miao to pout in dissatisfaction, “What’s wrong, Big Brother Yang won’t care.”</p>
<p>He Zao’s expression became helpless as she looked at Yang Kai apologetically, “Please forgive my little sister, Big Brother Yang, she grew up a bit spoiled.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, there’s no need to be so nervous,” Yang Kai waved his hand. When he met the two sisters back then, because everyone had similar strength, with their cultivation being higher than his own, they were able to interact as members of the same generation. Now though, with such a massive gap in strength appearing between them, He Zao was having some difficulty adapting.</p>
<p>After all, even their Honoured Master was only a First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, while Yang Kai had become a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master and was even on good terms with their Young Union Master.</p>
<p>Seeing her like this, Yang Kai could only change the subject and promptly asked about how they had been these past years.</p>
<p>With nothing to hide, He Zao immediately explained.</p>
<p>After escaping from the floating continent all those years ago, they had gone their separate ways. Yue Xi took the two sisters back to Sword Union, but because such massive losses were incurred during this operation, with a Starship destroyed and many Sword Union cultivators dying, as the leader at the time, Yue Xi almost suffered a disaster. In the end, though, a high-level Elder from Sword Union stepped forward to put in a good word for her, allowing Yue Xi to escape heavy sanction.</p>
<p>For this reason, Yue Xi and her two disciples began to follow Gu Jian Xin, because that Senior who spoke for them was one of the Young Union Master’s supporters.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1741, Arriving One After Another</h2>
<p>This time, Gu Jian Xin had set off from Sword Union’s Home Star for Azure Tree Star on some kind of business, and Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Miao had followed along. Never had they imagined they would get involved in such a battle and almost lose their lives.</p>
<p>After finishing her story, He Zao did not ask Yang Kai about his experiences over the years as she was aware her status and identity were not high enough to know.</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded faintly and said, “By the way, how much do you know about your Young Union Master, Gu Jian Xin?”</p>
<p>“Young Union Master?” He Zao was startled, “Does Big Brother Yang want to know more about the Young Union Master?”</p>
<p>“En,” Yang Kai was satisfied seeing her understand his intent. “Tell me whatever is convenient for you to disclose.”</p>
<p>He Zao smiled lightly, “I don’t know much actually, so there’s nothing inconvenient to talk about. Young Union Master can be said to be the most talented genius in Sword Union in the past thousand years. He is currently less than sixty but has already reached the peak of the Origin Realm. There are also rumours that he will be able to break through to the Origin King Realm within three to five years!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded while sipping his tea, motioning her to continue speaking with his eyes.</p>
<p>He had already learned this information from Liu Dong before.</p>
<p>“Young Union Master is humble, respectful, and righteous. He is the successor Union Master has placed his hopes on. Not only is his cultivation high, but his combat strength is also excellent as well. It seems that only Xue Yue, Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce’s Third Young Master, and Purple Star’s Zi Dong are able to compete with him among the younger generation of the Star Field.”</p>
<p>“Is that so…” Hearing this, another person suddenly appeared in Yang Kai’s mind.</p>
<p>Xu Bin Bai!</p>
<p>The interesting young man Yang Kai met outside Green Mountains Star’s Blood Prison that day! It was said that he was the Disciple of an Origin King Realm master named Wu Dao. This Wu Dao’s cultivation was so profound that even Green Mountains Star’s Star Master Luo Hai was extremely respectful of him, addressing him as Senior Wu Dao!</p>
<p>Wu Dao was no doubt a genuine Third-Order Origin King and one of the divine dragons who one could never catch sight of.</p>
<p>The disciple of such a person could not be worse than Gu Jian Xin, Xue Yue, or Zi Dong, perhaps even slightly stronger, but this thought lingered in Yang Kai’s mind for just a second, and he did not annunciate it.</p>
<p>He Zao had lived in Sword Union for a long time and her strength was not very high, so the things she had come into contact with were quite limited, making her vision somewhat narrow.</p>
<p>“Young Union Master’s reputation in Sword Union is also excellent. If not, Honoured Master would not have chosen to follow him. En, Young Union Master is always accompanied by his Left and Right Sword Servants. I’ve heard that they have cultivated together since childhood and are like brother and sisters.”</p>
<p>“Probably not just brother and sisters,” Yang Kai chuckled.</p>
<p>When the Left and Right Sword Servants looked at Gu Jian Xin, there was clearly more than just friendship in their eyes.</p>
<p>He Zao pursed her lips as a trace of crimson filled her cheeks. Squeezing her dress slightly, she didn’t respond to Yang Kai’s comment and instead continued, “The Left Sword Servant is called Ling Yue while the Right Sword Servant is called An Xing. Young Union Master and his Left and Right Sword Servants have cultivated a profound method together known as the Sun, Moon, and Stars Secret Techniques. Combined, the three of them can exert a combat power far beyond their own cultivation level. However, even without the assistance of his Left and Right Sword Servants, the personal combat power of the Young Union Master alone is very strong, and an ordinary Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cannot possibly be his opponent.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Whether a cultivator was powerful or not was often discernable at a glance. Gu Jian Xin gave Yang Kai a powerful feeling.</p>
<p>Clearly, Gu Jian Xin belonged to the elite of the elite!</p>
<p>“This is everything I know,” After He Zao finished speaking, she looked towards Yang Kai respectfully, as if waiting for his next instructions.</p>
<p>“Then Gu Jian Xin’s trip to Azure Tree Star this time, do you know what its purpose is?”</p>
<p>“I don’t, we were simply following orders. We didn’t even know where we were sailing to until Young Union Master mentioned it,” He Zao shook her head.</p>
<p>“Big Brother Yang, you are asking so many questions, so are you planning on being enemies with Young Union Master?” He Miao asked with some worry.</p>
<p>Yang Kai laughed and shook his head, “Why would I? There’s no grudge between us so how could I become Gu Jian Xin’s enemy? Besides, Gu Jian Xin should be a good person. However, since I have boarded his Starship, I naturally want to learn more about him. You don’t need to be so nervous.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” He Miao relaxed greatly while her little hand patted her rather well-endowed peaks, a relieved expression filling her face.</p>
<p>He Zao and He Miao were only Third-Order Saint Kings, and although they were somewhat young, they had a chance of becoming pillars of Sword Union in the years to come, but that was a matter for the future. With their current cultivation and status, they naturally did not have access to much high-level information.</p>
<p>To them, their current lives could be summed up in two words.</p>
<p>Follow orders!</p>
<p>There was no need to ask anything or even think too much, they simply needed to follow orders from above. Even if it was a task which would cost them their lives, they had no choice but to obey.</p>
<p>This was the sorrowful fate of cultivators at the bottom of great forces. These cultivators seemed to receive excellent shelter, but they lost some of their freedom in exchange. If Yang Kai really wanted to be an enemy of Gu Jian Xin, He Zao and He Miao would be put in a difficult position.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Yang Kai continued his conversation with He Zao and He Miao before asking them to leave.</p>
<p>“Big Brother Yang…” Before leaving though, He Zao suddenly turned around and called out.</p>
<p>“Is there something else?” Yang Kai looked at her.</p>
<p>He Zao bit her red lips lightly for a moment before shaking her head, “It’s nothing, please have a good rest. If you need anything, just summon us. We live in the fiftieth room of this wing.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Yang Kai nodded suspiciously.</p>
<p>After sending the sisters off, Yang Kai stood there and pondered for a moment. He Zao must have wanted to say something to him just now, but ultimately decided not to.</p>
<p>Although he had only met these two sisters twice, after the experience back on the floating continent a couple dozen years ago, sharing adversity together, they could be considered quite close.</p>
<p>The encounter this time had reaffirmed their bond of friendship.</p>
<p>If He Zao really asked him for help, Yang Kai would not refuse, unfortunately, it seemed she had concerns of her own and decided not to say anything, making it tricky for Yang Kai to ask as well.</p>
<p>“Big sister, did you want Big Brother Yang to speak on our behalf?” He Miao asked He Zao when they returned to their own room.</p>
<p>“En,” He Zao nodded lightly as she said quietly. “Now, only Big Brother Yang can help us. Even Honoured Master is unable to solve this problem.”</p>
<p>“So why didn’t you say anything? Big Brother Yang is a good person, so he would definitely not sit back and watch if you asked.”</p>
<p>“I believe so too…” He Zao sat down on the edge of the bed. “But this matter has nothing to do with him; it’s our own affair.”</p>
<p>“Elder Sister…” He Miao lay down and rested her head on He Zao’s lap while whispering sadly. “If we don’t do something, we’ll really have to… with that person…”</p>
<p>He Zao reached out her hand a brushed He Miao’s hair, a trace of sorrow also appearing on her pretty face, “En, if it weren’t for Senior Qin’s shelter all those years ago, we and Honoured Master would not have escaped punishment and would perhaps not even be alive today. He is Senior Qin’s son, and it is precisely because of this that Honoured Master was unable to refuse Senior Qin’s proposal. It should be… our turn to repay him. Over the years, Senior Qin has done much for us after all.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to!” He Miao stood up suddenly and displayed a fit of fierce anger as she clenched her fists and said firmly, “If that day comes, I’ll butcher that Qin Qi Yang brat first!”</p>
<p>He Zao was startled as she stared at He Miao in shock, quickly shouting, “You’re not allowed to talk such nonsense!”</p>
<p>He Miao pouted but did not speak anymore, sinking back down to the bed and falling into her big sister’s lap again.</p>
<p>Inside his room, Yang Kai had just sat down to meditate again when he heard another knock at the door.</p>
<p>This made him frown as he stood up slightly displeased and opened the door only to be met with a glamorous but slightly flustered face.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was stunned.</p>
<p>“Can I come in?” The visitor asked in a low voice as she looked around, seemingly afraid she would be discovered.</p>
<p>[What’s happening?] Yang Kai was even more at a loss; however, seeing the anxious look on the other party’s face, he did not refuse, moved to the side, and allowed this visitor to rush into the room, bringing with her a fragrant burst of wind.</p>
<p>After closing the door, Yang Kai turned to look at this beautiful woman and asked suspiciously, “Lady Yue, is there something you need to discuss with me?”</p>
<p>The person who had come was surprisingly the Honoured Master of He Zao and He Miao: Yue Xi!</p>
<p>Yang Kai was quite confused. The two sisters had only just left but now their Honoured Master had followed on their heels. What was happening here? If outsiders noticed this scene, it would certainly generate rumours about something unspeakable and shameful happening between him and these three.</p>
<p>“This Mistress greets Young Master Yang,” Yue Xi elegantly bowed and lightly opened her lips, saying, “This Mistress thanks Young Master Yang for his life-saving grace…”</p>
<p>“Speak frankly,” Yang Kai looked at her lightly.</p>
<p>Yue Xi’s face became stiff but soon she wore a bitter smile, bit her lips and hesitated for a moment before bluntly saying, “This Mistress wants to ask Young Master Yang to show mercy and save He Zao and He Miao from a miserable fate.”</p>
<p>“What’s happening to them?” Yang Kai frowned, “From what I can tell, they seem quite well without any signs of illness or injury. Is there some matter they need saving from?”</p>
<p>“It is true they are not ill or injured,” Yue Xi shook her head. “It’s just that they… one of them must marry a strange man, one who is not normal!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai squinted and stared straight at Yue Xi.</p>
<p>The force behind his gaze caused Yue Xi to feel quite pressured and her expression gradually became tense, a look of embarrassment and guilt flashing across her face, but soon, she raised her eyes again and stared straight at Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Have a seat first, then we can talk,” To Yue Xi’s surprise, Yang Kai motioned to her to sit down then poured her a cup of tea.</p>
<p>“Many thanks,” Yue Xi took a deep breath and took a seat.</p>
<p>“I’ll need you to explain in more detail,” Yang Kai sat on the other side and asked.</p>
<p>Yue Xi nodded, “I should have made myself clearer. It’s like this.”</p>
<p>After listening to her speak, Yang Kai understood the whole story.</p>
<p>This matter was related to the events of that year. When Yang Kai had first met Yue Xi, she was a Third-Order Saint King and commanded a Saint King Grade Starship charged with performing some low-risk tasks in the Star Field.</p>
<p>During the events of that year, Sword Union had suffered huge losses. In the end, only Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao had survived. After returning to Sword Union’s Home Star, they faced a disaster they were unable to resolve.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1741, Arriving One After Another</h2>

<p>Inside his room, Yang Kai had just sat down to meditate again when he heard another knock at the door.</p>
<p>This made him frown as he stood up slightly displeased and opened the door only to be met with a glamorous but slightly flustered face.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was stunned.</p>
<p>“Can I come in?” The visitor asked in a low voice as she looked around, seemingly afraid she would be discovered.</p>
<p>[What’s happening?] Yang Kai was even more at a loss; however, seeing the anxious look on the other party’s face, he did not refuse, moved to the side, and allowed this visitor to rush into the room, bringing with her a fragrant burst of wind.</p>
<p>After closing the door, Yang Kai turned to look at this beautiful woman and asked suspiciously, “Lady Yue, is there something you need to discuss with me?”</p>
<p>The person who had come was surprisingly the Honoured Master of He Zao and He Miao: Yue Xi!</p>
<p>Yang Kai was quite confused. The two sisters had only just left but now their Honoured Master had followed on their heels. What was happening here? If outsiders noticed this scene, it would certainly generate rumours about something unspeakable and shameful happening between him and these three.</p>
<p>“This Mistress greets Young Master Yang,” Yue Xi elegantly bowed and lightly opened her lips, saying, “This Mistress thanks Young Master Yang for his life-saving grace…”</p>
<p>“Speak frankly,” Yang Kai looked at her lightly.</p>
<p>Yue Xi’s face became stiff but soon she wore a bitter smile, bit her lips and hesitated for a moment before bluntly saying, “This Mistress wants to ask Young Master Yang to show mercy and save He Zao and He Miao from a miserable fate.”</p>
<p>“What’s happening to them?” Yang Kai frowned, “From what I can tell, they seem quite well without any signs of illness or injury. Is there some matter they need saving from?”</p>
<p>“It is true they are not ill or injured,” Yue Xi shook her head. “It’s just that they… one of them must marry a strange man, one who is not normal!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai squinted and stared straight at Yue Xi.</p>
<p>The force behind his gaze caused Yue Xi to feel quite pressured and her expression gradually became tense, a look of embarrassment and guilt flashing across her face, but soon, she raised her eyes again and stared straight at Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Have a seat first, then we can talk,” To Yue Xi’s surprise, Yang Kai motioned to her to sit down then poured her a cup of tea.</p>
<p>“Many thanks,” Yue Xi took a deep breath and took a seat.</p>
<p>“I’ll need you to explain in more detail,” Yang Kai sat on the other side and asked.</p>
<p>Yue Xi nodded, “I should have made myself clearer. It’s like this.”</p>
<p>After listening to her speak, Yang Kai understood the whole story.</p>
<p>This matter was related to the events of that year. When Yang Kai had first met Yue Xi, she was a Third-Order Saint King and commanded a Saint King Grade Starship charged with performing some low-risk tasks in the Star Field.</p>
<p>During the events of that year, Sword Union had suffered huge losses. In the end, only Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao had survived. After returning to Sword Union’s Home Star, they faced a disaster they were unable to resolve.</p>

<p>The cultivators gathered in the hall were constantly making toasts, and Yang Kai did not refuse any of them. With a gentle smile and a calm expression, he had created a particularly good impression of himself after exchanging drinks with everyone.</p>
<p>From time to time, he would chat and laugh with Gu Jian Xin while occasionally glancing at the beautiful dancers.</p>
<p>Time flew by, the wine flowed freely, and the atmosphere in the hall became more and more lively.</p>
<p>Most cultivators were bold and unrestrained people, so this kind of free banquet naturally became a good place for them to let down their guard and express themselves. The cultivators who followed Gu Jian Xin each drank and laughed heartily.</p>
<p>Although Gu Jian Xin drank a lot, he never became drunk. During this time, he was observing Yang Kai.</p>
<p>A dazzling star like Yang Kai suddenly appearing in the Star Field naturally drew Gu Jian Xin’s curiosity, and he naturally wanted to use this banquet to try to learn some more about him.</p>
<p>To his disappointment though, Gu Jian Xin was not able to learn much.</p>
<p>When Yang Kai looked at the young women below who were dancing and singing, his vision remained clear without any obscene desire, and when he drank and chatted with his subordinates, he always behaved following proper decorum.</p>
<p>All in all, Yang Kai was mysterious, but worth making friends with.</p>
<p>After drinking three rounds, Gu Jian Xin suddenly said, “Brother Yang, this Gu has an awkward request to make. I wonder if you’d be willing to listen?”</p>
<p>As soon as this remark came out, the noise in the hall suddenly decreased and although the cultivators present seemed to be drinking and chatting amongst themselves, all of them undoubtedly heard Gu Jian Xin’s words and diverted part of their attention to listen.</p>
<p>“Brother Gu can speak frankly,” Yang Kai put down his glass and smiled lightly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was actually somewhat surprised. Throughout the banquet, he had been looking for a suitable opportunity to discuss He Zao and He Mao’s situation with Gu Jian Xin, but before he could find one, Gu Jian Xin had spoken up first.</p>
<p>He wondered what this ‘awkward request’ would be.</p>
<p>“It’s like this,” Gu Jian Xin wore a solemn expression, “This Gu was ambushed by Old Dog Li and suffered great losses. Although Old Dog Li deserved his death, he was still one of my Sword Union’s Elders in the end, and the Soul Breaker Spear he wielded is a treasure my Sword Union spent countless materials and hired a renowned Origin King Grade Artifact Refiner to refine. Rather than Old Dog Li’s personal property, it is more appropriate to say it belongs to my Sword Union. Now that he is dead, however, it is this Gu’s responsibility to bring the Soul Breaker Spear back to the Home Star and inform the Union Master about what has transpired.”</p>
<p>Having said that, he looked at Yang Kai with some embarrassment.</p>
<p>Yang Kai immediately understood what he meant.</p>
<p>“Brother Gu wants to take back the Soul Breaker Spear?”</p>
<p>“En,” An awkward smile appeared on Gu Jian Xin’s face. “This Gu knows that this request is truly somewhat shameless. Since Old Dog Li was killed by Brother Yang, the Soul Breaker Spear should belong to you, but… without the Soul Breaker Spear, things will be difficult for this Gu upon his return, which is why I must ask for it back. Of course, this Gu guarantees he will compensate Brother Yang appropriately, so he does not suffer a loss in exchange for the Soul Breaker Spear. As for everything else Old Dog Li had on him, Brother Yang is free to keep them. Those things don’t belong to my Sword Union.”</p>
<p>“So that’s it,” Yang Kai gently nodded as he wore a look of contemplation.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin did not urge him and simply waited quietly.</p>
<p>Inside the hall, at some point silence had fallen as everyone paid full attention to what was happening at the head of the table.</p>
<p>After a while, Yang Kai nodded, “Good, the Soul Breaker Spear is an Origin King Grade artifact, and its value is not low. Brother Gu, if I return the Soul Breaker Spear to Sword Union, what compensation can I expect?”</p>
<p>“As long as the value does not exceed the value of the Soul Breaker Spear itself, this Gu will definitely acquire it for you!” Gu Jian Xin replied solemnly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai chuckled, “Since Brother Gu is so sincere, then this Yang will oblige. In any case, this artifact is of no use to me.”</p>
<p>He did not use a spear and there was no one among his close acquaintances who did, so Yang Kai didn’t feel much loss returning the Soul Breaker Spear.</p>
<p>Saying so, Yang Kai took the Soul Breaker Spear out of his Space Ring and placed it in front of Gu Jian Xin.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin gestured lightly, and the Left Sword Servant Ling Yue immediately stepped forward and collected this Origin King Grade artifact.</p>
<p>“For Brother Yang’s righteousness, this Gu is grateful. I wonder what kind of compensation Brother Yang wants in return? Although my Sword Union is not the strongest force in the Star Field, it is also not weak and possesses many rare cultivation resources and materials, pills and herbs. Even if Brother Yang wants some kind of profound Secret Art or Secret Technique, this Gu can find a way to acquire it for you!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai returning the Soul Breaker Spear without any hesitation was a great relief to Gu Jian Xin, so he was prepared to compensate him for his loss as much as possible.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled lightly and said, “There’s no need to rush this discussion of compensation, Brother Gu.”</p>
<p>“No rush?” Gu Jian Xin was taken aback.</p>
<p>“En, this Yang wants to ask: Who here is Senior Qin Wu Hui?”</p>
<p><em>Shua Shua Shua…</em></p>
<p>In the hall, almost everyone’s eyes turned towards a certain direction. Following these eyes, Yang Kai’s gaze landed on a thin old man wearing unremarkable grey robes who was sitting only a seat below Gu Jian Xin.</p>
<p>Being able to sit in such a position showed how high this man’s status was amongst this group.</p>
<p>Yang Kai suddenly calling his name caused Qin Wu Hui to show a puzzled look and he quickly stood up. Cupping his fists, this old man said, “This old master is Qin Wu Hui; there is no need for Young Master Yang to address this old master as Senior. What advice does Young Master Yang have?”</p>
<p>“Senior is too modest,” Yang Kai smiled. “Actually, I have something I wish to give Senior, and I hope you will not refuse!”</p>
<p>“You wish to give this old master something?” Qin Wu Hui was now completely confused.</p>
<p>He was certain he had never greeted or even met Yang Kai before today, and had no relationship with him, yet this young man suddenly wanted to give him something. Despite Qin Wu Hui’s vast knowledge and experience, Yang Kai’s actions left him baffled.</p>
<p>Before Qin Wu Hui could comprehend the situation though, Yang Kai tossed a jade bottle over to him.</p>
<p>There was no sign of any Saint Qi being used to send this jade bottle, so Qin Wu Hui simply caught it and asked in surprise, “Young Master Yang, this is…”</p>
<p>“Senior might as well open it,” Yang Kai smiled, “Naturally, you will know what is inside once you do.”</p>
<p>Qin Wu Hui furrowed his brow and turned his eyes towards Gu Jian Xin, but the latter just laughed loudly, “Since it was delivered to Elder Qin by Brother Yang, Elder Qin might as well take a look. This Young Master is also very curious about what Brother Yang is trying to peddle.”</p>
<p>Qin Wu Hui nodded and opened the bottle before everyone’s eyes before pouring out a pill onto his palm.</p>
<p>This pill was snow-white and only about the size of a bean, but when it appeared before his eyes, Qin Wu Hui’s suspicious expression suddenly became rosy, filled with surprise, excitement, and disbelief…</p>
<p>Immediately, he brought the pill to his nose, sniffed it carefully, and even licked it with his tongue.</p>
<p>He soon exclaimed, “This is… a Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill?”</p>
<p>“What?” Inside the hall, all the gathered cultivators called out in alarm as if an explosion had gone off, all of them gazing towards the pill in Qin Wu Hui’s hand in surprise before shifting to Yang Kai, seemingly eagerly waiting for him to answer.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin’s eyes flashed as well as he glanced towards Yang Kai thoughtfully and hesitantly asked, “Brother Yang, is this really a Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill?”</p>
<p>“Senior Qin’s vision is quite sharp; this is indeed a Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill!”</p>
<p>Receiving confirmation from Yang Kai, Qin Wu Hui was so excited that he almost jumped for joy.</p>
<p>Even Gu Jian Xin drew a deep breath and quickly said, “Brother Yang’s means are truly shocking!”</p>
<p>“It’s a mere pill,” Yang Kai smiled lightly.</p>
<p>“Young Master Yang, why would you…” Qin Wu Hui came back to his senses and held the jade bottle tightly in his hand as he looked towards Yang Kai with a puzzled expression, wondering why this unknown young man had suddenly given him this Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill.</p>
<p>“I heard that during a battle against a powerful opponent, Senior Qin’s son suffered a severe injury to his Soul. This Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill should be the appropriate medicine for this situation. Although I dare not say it is a miracle cure, if used in conjunction with appropriate treatment, it should be able to fully restore Young Lord Qin’s Soul over time,” Yang Kai looked at Qin Wu Hui with a smile.</p>
<p>Qin Wu Hui looked at Yang Kai with a face full of excitement.</p>
<p>What happened to Qin Qi Yang had become something of a heart demon to him, and he had been searching for a pill to treat his good-for-nothing son over the years. Unfortunately, even with his capabilities and Gu Jian Xin’s backing, Qin Wu Hui had been unsuccessful in his attempts so far.</p>
<p>Injuries to the Soul were far more difficult to treat than those to the body, and only some extremely special pills would be effective. If it was only a minor injury, things wouldn’t be quite so difficult, but Qin Qi Yang had been wounded so badly that he had degenerated into an idiot, which was a grave injury.</p>
<p>According to Qin Wu Hui’s research, there were only a few pills in existence that could completely heal this kind of injury, but most of those pills were extinct, with either their recipe having been lost to history or the materials required to refine them having disappeared.</p>
<p>The Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill was one such pill. Qin Wu Hui was able to recognize this pill immediately because he had been constantly searching through ancient books these past few years. He also knew that in order to refine this kind of pill, one needed to use the Monster Core of a Seven Coloured Elk!</p>
<p>The Seven Coloured Elk was an ancient exotic Monster Beast that had long ago gone extinct in the Star Field; it was now impossible to find one anywhere.</p>
<p>Even if the Monster Core of a Seven Coloured Elk could somehow be found, it was also an essential component in refining treasures like the Ten Thousand Year Incense, so who would use it to refine a mere Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill?</p>
<p>Yet now, Yang Kai had suddenly taken one out!</p>
<p>Qin Wu Hui gripped the jade bottle tightly as his lips trembled, now knowing what to say.</p>
<p>“Brother Yang, I heard that this Seven Orifices Cleansing Pill is an ancient pill which can even enhance a cultivator’s comprehension and aptitude if taken. Is this true?” Gu Jian Xin suddenly asked.</p>
<p>Enhancing comprehension and aptitude would classify this pill as a Heaven defying treasure.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, qualities like aptitude and talent were innate and could not be changed by external forces unless one had some kind of extraordinary opportunity.</p>
<p>As such, after hearing Gu Jian Xin’s words, all the cultivators in the room were thoroughly shocked as they realized that the true value of this pill was actually far higher than the Origin King Grade Soul Breaker Spear!</p>
<p>An artifact was only an external tool and could not fundamentally change a cultivator’s ability like their aptitude or talent could. The more valuable item was obvious.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1745, Azure Tree Star</h2>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain &amp;Dhael Ligerkeys</p>
<p>In the Star Field, each Cultivation Star had its own World Principles, so there were inevitably differences between them.</p>
<p>Whether it was in terms of World Energy or materials produced, or the number of cultivators living on it and the heights they could reach, there was a huge contrast between different Cultivation Stars.</p>
<p>For example, Tong Xuan Realm’s World Energy was extremely thin, so cultivators were limited to reaching the Saint Realm.</p>
<p>On some Cultivation Stars, the limit was the Saint King Realm, Origin Returning Realm…</p>
<p>Although Shadowed Star had rich World Energy, enough to support cultivators reaching the Origin King Realm, because of the World Principle suppression, it was impossible for cultivators to spy on the mysteries of the Origin King Realm.</p>
<p>Among the many Cultivation Stars, the most bountiful ones would be taken as Home Stars of great forces.</p>
<p>For example, Water Moon Star of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, Sword Star of Sword Union, Purple Star of Purple Star…</p>
<p>These Home Stars surpassed other Cultivation Stars in almost all aspects.</p>
<p>Azure Tree Star could only be regarded as an ordinary Cultivation Star with World Energy on par with Shadowed Star’s but with less than half the area.</p>
<p>In front of the Azure Tree Palace, Gu Jian Xin’s Starship descended slowly towards a square where a group of Sword Union cultivators were waiting to receive him.</p>
<p>The leader of this group was a beautiful woman with a stunning face and graceful figure. She was wearing a long black dress and had such abundant peaks that they nearly burst from their restraints. Her waist was slim while her legs were long and slender. On her face, she wore a warm smile that paired perfectly with her bright eyes while a mature aura lingered about her.</p>
<p>As soon as Gu Jian Xin disembarked from the Starship, he greeted this woman enthusiastically, “Aunt Lan, it’s been a long time.”</p>
<p>The beautiful woman called Aunt Lan smiled and said, “Greetings, Young Union Master. Subordinate has been anticipating your arrival.”</p>
<p>Saying so, she gave an elegant salute while the cultivators behind her also bowed in greeting.</p>
<p>“There are no outsiders here, so why must Aunt Lan act so politely?” Gu Jian Xin smiled and spoke. It was obvious that he had a good relationship with this beautiful woman.</p>
<p>“Courtesy cannot be abandoned!” Aunt Lan smiled sweetly before her pair of beautiful eyes swept the figures behind Gu Jian Xin, greeting Qin Wu Hui with a gentle nod then fixing on Yang Kai for a moment, a hint of suspicion flashing across her face.</p>
<p>She was naturally familiar with all of Gu Jian Xin’s important subordinates, but Yang Kai was a new face, which she found strange. Using her Divine Sense, she swept Yang Kai and discovered that he was actually a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, confusing her slightly more.</p>
<p>“It’s windy outside, let’s go inside before we talk further,” Gu Jian Xin did not immediately introduce Yang Kai to this beautiful woman and instead made such a proposal.</p>
<p>A gleam flitted across Aunt Lan’s eyes before she smiled and nodded, “Alright. This way, Young Union Master.”</p>
<p>Saying so, she led the way.</p>
<p>Azure Tree Palace was a symbolic building of Azure Tree Star, the headquarters established by Sword Union on Azure Tree Star to manage Azure Tree Star.</p>
<p>Yang Kai followed quietly while observing this beautiful woman named Aunt Lan.</p>
<p>Although he did not release his Divine Sense to investigate carefully, judging from the aura he felt from this beautiful woman, he was certain that she was an Origin King!</p>
<p>Thinking about it though, this was appropriate. Azure Tree Star was a critical Cultivation Star to Sword Union, so it was only natural that an Origin King Realm would be stationed here to preside over it. This beautiful woman named Aunt Lan should be a First-Order Origin King cultivator, because her aura had similar power to Li Ming Hai’s while it a far cry from Luo Hai’s.</p>
<p>The Azure Tree Palace occupied a wide area and after entering it and dispersing the miscellaneous people, Gu Jian Xin finally made introductions.</p>
<p>Through Gu Jian Xin’s introduction, Yang Kai learned that this beautiful woman was named Luo Lan, and she was indeed a First-Order Origin King as he suspected.</p>
<p>“Aunt Lan is the Star Master of Azure Tree Star and is responsible for all of Sword Union’s matters here!” Gu Jian Xin said.</p>
<p>“Star Master?” Yang Kai’s face changed slightly.</p>
<p>“Haha, it’s not what Brother Yang thinks,” Gu Jian Xin seemed to already know what Yang Kai was reacting to and explained with a smile, “This Star Master is not the kind of Star Master you imagine, it’s just a title.”</p>
<p>“So, it’s just a title,” Yang Kai felt relieved; after all, from what he knew, essentially all Star Masters were Third-Order Origin Kings, as only they seemed capable of refining a Star Source somewhat safely.</p>
<p>Luo Hai becoming Star Master of Green Mountains Star was entirely thanks to luck, and Yang Yan was the one who helped Yang Kai become Star Master of Shadowed Star.</p>
<p>Luo Lan was just a First-Order Origin King, so if she had managed to become a genuine Star Master, it could only be said that she obtained the greatest of opportunities!</p>
<p>However, if it was just a title given to her, it was not such a big deal. Any Origin King sent by Sword Union to oversee Azure Tree Star would receive the title of Star Master.</p>
<p>This Star Master was nothing more than a status indicator and did not come with the conveniences and advantages a true Star Master should have.</p>
<p>“Little brother seems quite surprised, could it be you’ve met a Star Master before?” Luo Lan was a woman with keen intuition and immediately inferred something from the changes in Yang Kai’s expression.</p>
<p>“En… I had the honour of meeting Sir Luo Hai on Green Mountains Star a few years ago,” Yang Kai casually explained.</p>
<p>“Sir Luo Hai…” Luo Lan murmured, “A few years ago? It seems that this brother had participated in the Blood Prison Trial.”</p>
<p>“En.”</p>
<p>“Brother Yang also participated in the Blood Prison Trial?” Gu Jian Xin was shocked as he looked at Yang Kai in amazement.</p>
<p>It seemed that Yang Kai having his current achievements was not simply a matter of luck. Gu Jian Xin learned from Yang Kai that he had explored the Emperor Garden, and now it seems he also underwent the Blood Prison Trial.</p>
<p>Surviving and returning from the two fierce lands one after another with just luck was not enough. It took true ability.</p>
<p>“Impressive!” Gu Jian Xin expressed his sincere admiration, cupping his fists in respect.</p>
<p>“Haha,” Yang Kai chuckled slightly awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, it seems that less than two years after the Blood Prison Trial, Luo Hai was killed. This incident shocked the entire Star Field,” Luo Lan muttered quietly.</p>
<p>“This Young Master also heard about that incident. Unexpectedly, someone like Luo Hai could be killed; who could have been responsible??</p>
<p>Yang Kai remained silent, his expression calm.</p>
<p>“By the way, Aunt Lan, I was ambushed by Li Ming Hai on my way here this time,” Gu Jian Xin changed the subject abruptly.</p>
<p>“What?” Luo Lan’s beautiful face paled, “Were you hurt?”</p>
<p>“My injuries have already healed. It was all thanks to Brother Yang’s help though, otherwise, I’m afraid I would have met disaster.”</p>
<p>“Him?” Luo Lan glanced at Yang Kai suspiciously. Although she was not sure what happened, since Gu Jian Xin said that Yang Kai helped him escape danger, she naturally would not question him and said with a serious expression, “Many thanks for offering your aid, little brother. This Queen will certainly repay you for your efforts.”</p>
<p>“Senior is too polite, Brother Gu and I are like old friends. It was just some trivial assistance, nothing worth mentioning,” Yang Kai said modestly.</p>
<p>“Trivial…” Luo Lan’s expression became extremely weird.</p>
<p>Being ambushed by an Origin King was no trivial matter, and she could almost imagine the great risks involved. If one thing had gone wrong, Gu Jian Xin would likely not be standing in front of her right now, already buried in a remote corner of the Star Field.</p>
<p>“Where is that bastard Li Ming Hai now?” Luo Lan turned her gaze to Gu Jian Xin again as a cold murderous intent flashed across her beautiful eyes, “Daring to do such a thing, there will be no place for him in the Star Field again!”</p>
<p>“He’s dead!” Gu Jian Xin quickly said.</p>
<p>Luo Lan’s jaw dropped and only after a short silence did she ask, “How did he die?”</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin only glanced over at Yang Kai as a response.</p>
<p>Luo Lan once again turned a suspicious gaze towards him.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled harmlessly and said, “I only gave him a sneak attack while he was concentrated on fighting Brother Gu.”</p>
<p>Luo Lan was again a little speechless but soon smiled and said, “Little brother conceals himself quite well.”</p>
<p>“He simply let success get to his head at the time,” Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>Seeing his casual expression, Luo Lan immediately knew that Yang Kai did not want to talk about this topic anymore, so she smartly advanced the conversation, “Since even Li Ming Hai died, the situation can be considered closed; however, Young Master being able to escape this time was only thanks to a fortunate encounter with a noble person who provided assistance. You cannot act so recklessly in the future.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Gu Jian Xin nodded solemnly, “Oh yeah, Aunt Lan, I brought Brother Yang here this time mainly to consult with you about something.”</p>
<p>“Oh, what?”</p>
<p>“Brother Yang wants to build a palace on Azure Tree Star and needs a plot of land about a hundred thousand kilometres across, does Aunt Lan have any appropriate locations?”</p>
<p>“A hundred thousand kilometres…” Luo Lan pondered for a moment before saying, “There are many options, but I do not know what kind of location little brother would prefer, so why don’t we discuss this matter while consulting Azure Tree Star’s map tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Sound good. I shall trouble you, Senior.”</p>
<p>“Little brother need not be so polite. You saved Young Master’s life, so a hundred-thousand-kilometre territory is nothing to Sword Union.”</p>
<p>“Junior will take his leave first then. I look forward to meeting you again tomorrow, Senior,” Yang Kai knew that Gu Jian Xin brought him over to meet Luo Lan and discuss his request for a piece of land, but now that introductions were finished these two certainly had other confidential matters to discuss which were not appropriate for him to overhear.</p>
<p>“I’ll see you out,” Gu Jian Xin gestured before leading Yang Kai out.</p>
<p>Outside, a maidservant was assigned to lead Yang Kai to a guest room in the Azure Tree Palace to rest.</p>
<p>After Yang Kai left, Luo Lan released her Divine Sense and opened the many barriers around the room to ensure no one could spy on this place before asking solemnly, “Young Master, that Yang Kai… is he credible?”</p>
<p>“En, according to my observations along the way, he has nothing to do with Sword Union and him appearing where Li Ming Hai was lying in ambush for me was simply a coincidence. It was Li Ming Hai who launched a sneak attack on him first.”</p>
<p>“He managed to survive a sneak attack from Li Ming Hai?” Luo Lan’s expression changed slightly.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how he managed that,” Gu Jian Xin slowly shook his head, “However, there is no doubt about his strength. What he said before was simply giving me face. Li Ming Hai dying was almost entirely thanks to him, and although part of the reason was him successfully launching a sneak attack…. Aunt Lan, you’ve lived many years, but have you ever heard of an Origin Realm cultivator killing an Origin King before?”</p>
<h2>Chapter 1746, Topographical Map</h2>
<p>“No!” Luo Lan shook her head solemnly before glaring at Gu Jian Xin suddenly, “Oh? You said your ‘Aunt Lan has lived many years’? Are you saying your Aunt Lan is old?”</p>
<p>“Uh…” Gu Jian Xin scratched his head awkwardly and quickly wore a serious face as he tried to change the subject. “Moreover, according to my observations, he actually used Space Force to sneak attack Li Ming Hai!”</p>
<p>Luo Lan’s attention was on something important, so it took a while to process the additional information and asked, “Space Force? He’s able to use such a strange power in battle?”</p>
<p>“It’s more than that!” Gu Jian Xin recalled the scene at the time and his expression constantly fluctuated as he said solemnly, “His accomplishments in the Dao of Space seem to have reached an unprecedented level. He was able to condense his Space Force into a coherent blade that cut and exiled part of Li Ming Hai’s body to The Void!”</p>
<p>Luo Lan could not help gasping when she heard this.</p>
<p>“Suffice it to say, I only want to make friends with him, and definitely not become enemies, so I will have to ask Aunt Lan to pay some more attention to him in the future.”</p>
<p>“Rest assured, since he wants a hundred-thousand-kilometre territory here, there will always be opportunities for us to come into contact in the future,” Luo Lan’s beautiful eyes glowed with a strange light, as if she had become interested in Yang Kai, and continued. “Good, tell me in detail about the fight between you and Li Ming Hai. Aunt Lan is very curious.”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Either Sword Union always moved quickly, or Luo Lan was simply an efficient administrator, but Yang Kai had only stayed in the Azure Tree Palace for a single day before he was summoned by Luo Lan to discuss something.</p>
<p>Yang Kai naturally understood this was about the territory he asked for and did not delay.</p>
<p>Following the messenger who had come to summon him, Yang Kai made his way through the halls of the Azure Tree Palace for a short time before meeting a casually-dressed Gu Jian Xin in a certain corridor. The latter saw Yang Kai and beckoned to him with a smile.</p>
<p>The Left Sword Servant Ling Yue and Right Sword Servant An Xing were standing together with him.</p>
<p>“Brother Gu!” Yang Kai stepped forward and cupped his fists.</p>
<p>“How is Brother Yang’s accommodation?” Gu Jian Xin asked enthusiastically.</p>
<p>“Extremely comfortable!” Yang Kai replied.</p>
<p>“That’s good, this Gu was worried he was not offering good enough hospitality, but since Brother Yang says he is comfortable, I can feel relieved.”</p>
<p>“En, Senior Luo asked me to see her…”</p>
<p>“It’s as you think,” Gu Jian Xin grinned at Yang Kai before drawing him along with him. “Follow me.”</p>
<p>Walking down this corridor, the group of four soon came to a light curtain which shrouded the way forward, making it impossible for anyone to see past it. This light curtain was like a waterfall that flickered with countless tiny flowing runes which swam about like small fish, giving it a mysterious and complex appearance.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin did not even spare the light curtain a glance and walked straight forward, only pausing for a moment to tell his Left and Right Sword Servants, “You remain here. Execute anyone who dares try to intrude.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Ling Yue and An Xing nodded firmly as they stood outside.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin then led Yang Kai directly past the light curtain.</p>
<p>After experiencing a flash of light, Yang Kai found himself in a seemingly entirely different world.</p>
<p>The whole place was silent and there was nothing of note except for a huge spherical object positioned in the middle of the space.</p>
<p>This sphere was almost two dozen metres in diameter and had irregular patterns covering it, some of which were yellow, some blue, some green, all of them occupying different areas on the sphere’s surface.</p>
<p>As Yang Kai got close, he noticed the sphere was spinning clockwise at a subtle speed.</p>
<p>Luo Lan was standing nearby and greeted with a smile, “Little Brother!”</p>
<p>“Senior Luo!” Yang Kai hurriedly returned the courtesy, but soon his attention was attracted to the sphere in front of him again.</p>
<p>Luo Lan and Gu Jian Xin did not seem like they intended to explain and simply observed the changes in Yang Kai’s expression with interest.</p>
<p>Soon though, Yang Kai showed a look of understanding, turned to Luo Lan and Gu Jian Xin, and said in surprise, “Is this a model of Azure Tree Star shrunk down countless times?”</p>
<p>“Little Brother’s intuition is sharp!” Luo Lan smiled and nodded, “This is indeed a tiny replica of Azure Tree Star. It took many cultivators from our Sword Union a hundred years to survey all of Azure Tree Star’s environments, measuring each region and categorizing them to complete this design.”</p>
<p>“Is this the map Senior mentioned yesterday?” Yang Kai asked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Exactly!” Gu Jian Xin smiled and nodded, “The map that Aunt Lan was talking about yesterday refers to this thing, which was why we had to wait until today to let Brother Yang see it.”</p>
<p>“There are many conveniences to this thing,” Yang Kai muttered in surprise as he circled the sphere, soon understanding what the different colours represented.</p>
<p>The yellow colours represented plains, while the blue was water and the green was forest.</p>
<p>There were a small number of other colours also present which obviously corresponded to rarer areas like swamps and deserts.</p>
<p>Sword Union’s methods were impressive, but… taking a hundred years to complete a project like this was something only a super force could afford.</p>
<p>Looking closer, there were many large and small city-like signs on this sphere, which were obviously settlements where cultivators on Azure Tree Star gathered.</p>
<p>With this, Luo Lan would find it much easier to manage Azure Tree Star.</p>
<p>While Yang Kai observed, Luo Lan took the initiative to explain to him. As Yang Kai expected, the different colours really did correspond to different geographical environments, and depending on the colour’s depth, one could tell the richness of the ambient World Energy in those areas.</p>
<p>The lighter the colour, the thinner the World Energy and vice versa.</p>
<p>After briefly explaining to Yang Kai about this map, Luo Lan said, “The piece of land Little Brother wants, a piece of land a hundred thousand kilometres is neither big nor small, so this Queen has selected a few locations for you to choose from. Of course, these are just areas this Queen thinks are suitable. If Little Brother is not satisfied, he is free to choose any other spot on Azure Tree Star!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai was grateful and cupped his fists, “Junior will be accepting Senior’s good intentions then. Please advise me.”</p>
<p>“Little Brother need not be so polite,” Luo Lan smiled, stretched out her hand towards the large spherical map in front of her, spun it slightly then halted it at a certain position. Luo Lan pointed to a certain place and said, “This is the first place this Queen selected. This area is surrounded by mountains and rivers and is rich in materials as well as World Energy. There is also a city nearby, which would fall under Little Brother’s jurisdiction.”</p>
<p>“A city? Is that alright?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.</p>
<p>He only wanted a piece of land that was not too barren and never expected he would actually be given an entire city to control.</p>
<p>“It’s no big deal, it’s just a single city,” Gu Jian Xin grinned.</p>
<p>“Indeed, on Azure Tree Star, even if there aren’t ten thousand such cities, there are at least eight thousand. Having Little Brother assume command of it would be this place’s blessing,” Luo Lan also added with a smile. Yang Kai did not know what Gu Jian Xin had told her yesterday, but he could tell that Luo Lan’s attitude towards him had changed subtly and was much more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>“If Little Brother is not satisfied with this place, then how about here,” Luo Lan waved her hand and spun the map again, pointing to another spot and explaining, “This place is also quite good. This Queen has been here before and can attest to its beautiful scenery and numerous great beauties…”</p>
<p>Seeing Yang Kai remain indifferent, Luo Lan immediately introduced him to the next place.</p>
<p>After introducing seven places in a row, Yang Kai still had nothing to say.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the places Luo Lan selected for Yang Kai were indeed quite good, with rich World Energy and numerous other advantageous conditions, each one an extremely generous proposal.</p>
<p>But Yang Kai did not seem to be satisfied with any of them, causing Luo Lan to be a little puzzled, not knowing exactly what he was looking for.</p>
<p>“Senior Luo, is there a suitable place on the sea?” Yang Kai saw that she was about to introduce the next place and quickly asked.</p>
<p>“On the sea?” Luo Lan raised her brow before smiling, “So Little Brother would like to live next to the sea! What do you think about this position?”</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>Half an hour later, Yang Kai walked out of the mysterious space with a content look upon his face.</p>
<p>After making a few comparisons, he finally chose a place called Twin Shark Island.</p>
<p>It was difficult to classify Twin Shark Island as a single island or two, because if one looked from above, they would see that, although narrow and shallow, there was a connection between them. When viewed from the side, this island, or islands rather looked like two sharks advancing side by side through the sea, a very vivid image.</p>
<p>Hence the name, Twin Shark Island!</p>
<p>The area was very in line with Yang Kai’s requirements, no more, no less, exactly one hundred thousand kilometres in total.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was a medium-sized sea-side city five hundred thousand kilometres away from Twin Shark Island!</p>
<p>This island was relatively remote on Azure Tree Star, and Luo Lan and Gu Jian Xin could not understand why he chose such a place; after all, compared with the locations Luo Lan introduced to him before, Twin Shark Island’s only advantage was its rich World Energy aura.</p>
<p>It seemed like Yang Kai was going around the sun to reach the moon and intentionally took a bad deal.</p>
<p>But since Yang Kai had already decided, they did not try to persuade him otherwise.</p>
<p>And so, Twin Shark Island became Yang Kai’s territory from now on. As long as the faction Gu Jian Xin led still controlled Sword Union, no one would be able to take Twin Shark Island away from him.</p>
<p>This was also Gu Jian Xin’s commitment to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not care too much though; now that this site belonged to him, if someone dared try to take it from him in the future, they would first have to weigh the consequences.</p>
<p>The next day, Yang Kai bid farewell to Luo Lan and Gu Jian Xin and prepared to leave for Twin Shark Island.</p>
<p>Outside the Azure Tree Palace, Gu Jian Xin wore a slightly guilty expression as he said, “Brother Yang, unfortunately, this Gu cannot take you there in person. I have come to Azure Tree Star on important business, so my time is quite limited.”</p>
<p>“Brother Gu doesn’t need to pay it any mind, I can find my way to Twin Shark Island. Moreover, with this token given to me by Senior Luo, travelling and making arrangements will be convenient,” Yang Kai smiled lightly.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin nodded, “Indeed.”</p>
<p>Then, making a mysterious smile, he added, “But Brother Yang, there are a few people here who would like to travel with you to Twin Shark Island. I hope you won’t refuse.”</p>

<p>“Someone wants to go with me? Who?” Yang Kai frowned. He hadn’t heard anything about this beforehand.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin glanced to the side and after following his line of sight, Yang Kai saw three familiar faces.</p>
<p>“Young Master Yang!” Yue Xi walked over slowly and stood not far away.</p>
<p>“Big Brother Yang,” He Zao and He Miao also called out cheerfully.</p>
<p>Yang Kai looked at Gu Jian Xin, who shrugged his shoulders and smiled, “I’ve expelled them from Sword Union. As the Young Union Master, I have such rights.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression changed.</p>
<p>“Then, I asked them what they plan to do in the future, and they all said they wanted to follow you. I wonder if you’d be willing to take them in?” Gu Jian Xin added with a grin.</p>
<p>“Many thanks for your kindness, Brother Gu,” Yang Kai said seriously.</p>
<p>With his shrewdness, how could Yang Kai not notice that Gu Jian Xin was doing him a favour? After all, he was just a lone wanderer on Azure Tree Star, and although he was strong, there were always some matters that would be inconvenient for Yang Kai to handle in person, so having competent assistants was a necessity.</p>
<p>With Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao following him, the situation would be different. Some of the trivial matters that needed to be attended to could be left to them, and if it was ever inconvenient for Yang Kai to handle something personally, he could ask one of these three to manage it.</p>
<p>This move also spared Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao from enduring some awkward situations in Sword Union in the future. As Yang Kai said before, after the matter regarding Qin Qi Yang was dealt with in such a manner, Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao would find it difficult to remain in Sword Union. No matter where they went, they would be accused of ingratitude.</p>
<p>Now that they had been expelled from Sword Union though, this would no longer be an issue.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin was a sharp individual and was trying to make the best impression he could on Yang Kai, so he had not hesitated to make this move.</p>
<p>This was a kindness to him, so Yang Kai naturally had no reason to refuse.</p>
<p>Turning to Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao, Yang Kai asked solemnly, “Are you willing to follow me?”</p>
<p>“As long as the Young Lord is willing to give us shelter, this Yue Xi is willing to do her best to serve him!” Yue Xi quickly replied.</p>
<p>“We are willing!” The two sisters said in unison.</p>
<p>“Good, then from now on, you will follow me,” Yang Kai nodded.</p>
<p>“Many thanks, Young Lord!” Yue Xi elegant bowed, her face overflowing with joy.</p>
<p>“Little brother…” Luo Lan, who was standing next to him, only spoke up now and said, “As for the Space Spirit Crystals you need, for the time being, this Queen is unable to gather much, but she will do her best to collect some and have them sent to you later. Would that be acceptable?”</p>
<p>“En, I’ll have to trouble Senior with this matter then.”</p>
<p>After Yang Kai chose Twin Shark Island as his site, he asked Gu Jian Xin and Luo Lan to acquire a large amount of Space Spirit Crystals for him, but these things were too scarce, so Luo Lan was unable to acquire a large quantity of them in such a short span of time. However, with her promise, Yang Kai was assured he would get some sooner or later.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Yang Kai took Yue Xi, He Mao, and He Zao, summoned his Star Shuttle, and left the Azure Tree Palace.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin and the others watched Yang Kai leave before returning to the palace.</p>
<p>Going to Twin Shark Island would take half a month despite using the Space Arrays on Azure Tree Star.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Yang Kai had the token given to him by Luo Lan, and with it, all the Space Arrays of the major cities on Azure Tree Star were open to him.</p>
<p>Following the route given to him by Luo Lan, Yang Kai travelled through various Space Arrays for half a month before arriving at Twin Shark Island.</p>
<p>Although Twin Shark Island was remote, it still had a Space Array used to connect with the outside world, and when the figures of Yang Kai and his group appeared on the platform, the cultivator responsible for guarding this place immediately came forward and swept his eyes over them before performing his routine duties, “Travelers, what business do you have here on Twin Shark Island?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced at him and found that this person was only a Third-Order Saint King while the other cultivators responsible for guarding this place also were not very strong.</p>
<p>From the level of these cultivators, it could be inferred that the total strength of Twin Shark Island was not very high.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not answer directly and instead took out the token given to him and showed it to this guard.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” The cultivator’s eyes narrowed slightly as a blank expression appeared on his face.</p>
<p>“You don’t know?” Yang Kai frowned, “Well, it doesn’t matter if you don’t know what it is, what is your Island Master’s name and where is he? Take me to see him.”</p>
<p>The cultivator was shocked by Yang Kai’s aggressive questioning and domineering attitude. Although he did not recognize what this token represented, he could faintly guess that Yang Kai had a powerful background.</p>
<p>Immediately fixing his previous careless attitude, he replied suspiciously, “Island Master’s name is Zhu Liang. Dare I ask where these friends come from and how they know Sir Island Master?”</p>
<p>Before Yang Kai could answer, Yue Xi coldly snorted, “Are you qualified to ask about my Young Lord’s identity? Hurry up and lead the way!”</p>
<p>As she spoke, she intentionally released a bit of her Shi, causing the guard to change in complexion and realize that this man and three women were not people he could contend with. As such, he quickly bowed and guided them.</p>
<p>This was another advantage of having confident subordinates. Yue Xi speaking up there would raise Yang Kai’s identity and status and avoid some troublesome inquiries.</p>
<p>Yang Kai shot Yue Xi an approving look, to which the latter responded with a smile.</p>
<p>The strength of Twin Shark Island’s Island Master Zhu Liang was not very high, only First-Order Origin Returning Realm. On such a remote island, it was quite rare for powerful cultivators to appear.</p>
<p>After Yang Kai showed him the token and Luo Lan’s handwritten note, Zhu Liang immediately acknowledged Yang Kai as this place’s new master.</p>
<p>Being able to assume command of Twin Shark Island so smoothly satisfied Yang Kai greatly.</p>
<p>“En, you will remain as Island Master in the future, and you will manage Twin Shark Island as before. I will not interfere in any of your affairs. If there are any problems you cannot handle, you can inform Lady Yue and she will convey it to me.”</p>
<p>“I understand!” Seemingly realizing Yang Kai was easy to get along with, Zhu Liang gradually became less nervous.</p>
<p>“Island Master Zhu…”</p>
<p>“I am just a subordinate,” Zhu Liang responded quickly, “Sir should simply call this Zhu Liang by his name.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently nodded, “Okay, tell me about the situation on Twin Shark Island.”</p>
<p>“Understood!” Zhu Liang gathered his thoughts for a moment before explaining, “Twin Shark Island is approximately one hundred thousand kilometres across and has fairly rich World Energy; however, it doesn’t produce any notable resources, making supplies a slight problem. Currently, there are roughly two hundred thousand residents on the island. The average cultivation level here is not high. Despite his lack of talent, your subordinate here is actually the strongest master on Twin Shark Island at the First-Order Origin Returning Realm. In addition to me, there are three other First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators on the island who serve as the Deputy Island Master and Elders. This lowly one has set up an Elder Council to manage the matters of Twin Shark Island with several elders…”</p>
<p>“Five hundred thousand kilometres east of Twin Shark Island there is a city which is connected via Space Array. In the surrounding million-kilometre region, there are many other islands with similar situations to Twin Shark Island, and the relationship between the islands is fairly peaceful with only occasional contact. The biggest danger here comes from sea beasts. Every year, sea beasts will attack the island, resulting in much damage and loss of life; however, Twin Shark Island will certainly be much safer and more peaceful in the future with Sir here!”</p>
<p>While explaining, Zhu Liang also took the opportunity to flatter Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai paid this no mind though.</p>
<p>Zhu Liang continued, “The biggest output of Twin Shark Island and the nearby islands are the Monster Cores from sea beasts. Every year, many foreign cultivators come to Twin Shark Island to hunt these sea beasts…”</p>
<p>After half an hour of questioning, Yang Kai had a cursory understanding of the situation on Twin Shark Island.</p>
<p>Overall, he was quite satisfied with this place and found it very suitable for his next plan.</p>
<p>However, he needed to find an appropriate location before implementing that plan.</p>
<p>Yang Kai decided to handle this personally.</p>
<p>After dismissing Zhu Liang, Yang Kai assigned Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao some tasks before flying off on his Star Shuttle alone to investigate the terrain of Twin Shark Island.</p>
<p>This survey took Yang Kai eight days to complete.</p>
<p>In the end, Yang Kai chose an area in the southeast that was close to the sea and had excellent scenery. Most importantly though, there was a large amount of open space here with few traces of cultivators ever visiting.</p>
<p>Yang Kai found Zhu Liang again and asked him to recruit some cultivators from Twin Shark Island to build a palace there.</p>
<p>Yang Kai naturally was not going to let others work in vain and offered Saint Crystals as payment.</p>
<p>Would Zhu Liang refuse this golden opportunity? Even if Yang Kai did not pay, he would still do his best to fulfil Yang Kai’s request.</p>
<p>There were two hundred thousand people on Twin Shark Island, so Zhu Liang casually gave an order to recruit a thousand people and had them begin constructing a large palace at the place Yang Kai designated.</p>
<p>The cultivators began immediately and worked at an incredibly fast pace. Within half a month, a magnificent palace was built that stretched across a more than ten-kilometre-wide area.</p>
<p>Zhu Liang even paid out of his own pocket to add some furniture and decorations to the palace.</p>
<p>Once it was finished, Yang Kai moved in with Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao.</p>
<p>The palace was huge and seemed quite quiet and lonely with only four people inside of it.</p>
<p>Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao did not understand why Yang Kai had built such a huge palace here, but knowing it wasn’t their place to ask, they simply obeyed his instructions and served him with dedication.</p>
<p>That night, Yang Kai called them into his room.</p>
<p>“What orders does Young Lord have for us?” Yue Xi asked curiously.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing so serious. Have a seat first,” Yang Kai motioned to them.</p>
<p>After the three women were seated, Yang Kai continued, “Since you have chosen to follow me in the future, then I will not mistreat you. Having said so, I will inform you now that I have a Sect called High Heaven Sect, of which I am the Sect Master. The Sect’s headquarters is on a very remote Cultivation Star. Would you like to join High Heaven Sect?”</p>
<p>The Master and Disciples glanced at each other before looking at Yang Kai and without hesitation nodding together, “Of course we would.”</p>
<p>“En, then from now on, you are members of High Heaven Sect,” Yang Kai smiled and said, “The Sect headquarters is a long way away, so you won’t have an opportunity to visit it in the short term, but rest assured, a day will come when I bring you to see it. High Heaven Sect… in the future, it will not be weak.”</p>

<p>“Someone wants to go with me? Who?” Yang Kai frowned. He hadn’t heard anything about this beforehand.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin glanced to the side and after following his line of sight, Yang Kai saw three familiar faces.</p>
<p>“Young Master Yang!” Yue Xi walked over slowly and stood not far away.</p>
<p>“Big Brother Yang,” He Zao and He Miao also called out cheerfully.</p>
<p>Yang Kai looked at Gu Jian Xin, who shrugged his shoulders and smiled, “I’ve expelled them from Sword Union. As the Young Union Master, I have such rights.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression changed.</p>
<p>“Then, I asked them what they plan to do in the future, and they all said they wanted to follow you. I wonder if you’d be willing to take them in?” Gu Jian Xin added with a grin.</p>
<p>“Many thanks for your kindness, Brother Gu,” Yang Kai said seriously.</p>
<p>With his shrewdness, how could Yang Kai not notice that Gu Jian Xin was doing him a favour? After all, he was just a lone wanderer on Azure Tree Star, and although he was strong, there were always some matters that would be inconvenient for Yang Kai to handle in person, so having competent assistants was a necessity.</p>
<p>With Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao following him, the situation would be different. Some of the trivial matters that needed to be attended to could be left to them, and if it was ever inconvenient for Yang Kai to handle something personally, he could ask one of these three to manage it.</p>
<p>This move also spared Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao from enduring some awkward situations in Sword Union in the future. As Yang Kai said before, after the matter regarding Qin Qi Yang was dealt with in such a manner, Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao would find it difficult to remain in Sword Union. No matter where they went, they would be accused of ingratitude.</p>
<p>Now that they had been expelled from Sword Union though, this would no longer be an issue.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin was a sharp individual and was trying to make the best impression he could on Yang Kai, so he had not hesitated to make this move.</p>
<p>This was a kindness to him, so Yang Kai naturally had no reason to refuse.</p>
<p>Turning to Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao, Yang Kai asked solemnly, “Are you willing to follow me?”</p>
<p>“As long as the Young Lord is willing to give us shelter, this Yue Xi is willing to do her best to serve him!” Yue Xi quickly replied.</p>
<p>“We are willing!” The two sisters said in unison.</p>
<p>“Good, then from now on, you will follow me,” Yang Kai nodded.</p>
<p>“Many thanks, Young Lord!” Yue Xi elegant bowed, her face overflowing with joy.</p>
<p>“Little brother…” Luo Lan, who was standing next to him, only spoke up now and said, “As for the Space Spirit Crystals you need, for the time being, this Queen is unable to gather much, but she will do her best to collect some and have them sent to you later. Would that be acceptable?”</p>
<p>“En, I’ll have to trouble Senior with this matter then.”</p>
<p>After Yang Kai chose Twin Shark Island as his site, he asked Gu Jian Xin and Luo Lan to acquire a large amount of Space Spirit Crystals for him, but these things were too scarce, so Luo Lan was unable to acquire a large quantity of them in such a short span of time. However, with her promise, Yang Kai was assured he would get some sooner or later.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Yang Kai took Yue Xi, He Mao, and He Zao, summoned his Star Shuttle, and left the Azure Tree Palace.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin and the others watched Yang Kai leave before returning to the palace.</p>
<p>Going to Twin Shark Island would take half a month despite using the Space Arrays on Azure Tree Star.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Yang Kai had the token given to him by Luo Lan, and with it, all the Space Arrays of the major cities on Azure Tree Star were open to him.</p>
<p>Following the route given to him by Luo Lan, Yang Kai travelled through various Space Arrays for half a month before arriving at Twin Shark Island.</p>
<p>Although Twin Shark Island was remote, it still had a Space Array used to connect with the outside world, and when the figures of Yang Kai and his group appeared on the platform, the cultivator responsible for guarding this place immediately came forward and swept his eyes over them before performing his routine duties, “Travelers, what business do you have here on Twin Shark Island?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced at him and found that this person was only a Third-Order Saint King while the other cultivators responsible for guarding this place also were not very strong.</p>
<p>From the level of these cultivators, it could be inferred that the total strength of Twin Shark Island was not very high.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not answer directly and instead took out the token given to him and showed it to this guard.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” The cultivator’s eyes narrowed slightly as a blank expression appeared on his face.</p>
<p>“You don’t know?” Yang Kai frowned, “Well, it doesn’t matter if you don’t know what it is, what is your Island Master’s name and where is he? Take me to see him.”</p>
<p>The cultivator was shocked by Yang Kai’s aggressive questioning and domineering attitude. Although he did not recognize what this token represented, he could faintly guess that Yang Kai had a powerful background.</p>
<p>Immediately fixing his previous careless attitude, he replied suspiciously, “Island Master’s name is Zhu Liang. Dare I ask where these friends come from and how they know Sir Island Master?”</p>
<p>Before Yang Kai could answer, Yue Xi coldly snorted, “Are you qualified to ask about my Young Lord’s identity? Hurry up and lead the way!”</p>
<p>As she spoke, she intentionally released a bit of her Shi, causing the guard to change in complexion and realize that this man and three women were not people he could contend with. As such, he quickly bowed and guided them.</p>
<p>This was another advantage of having confident subordinates. Yue Xi speaking up there would raise Yang Kai’s identity and status and avoid some troublesome inquiries.</p>
<p>Yang Kai shot Yue Xi an approving look, to which the latter responded with a smile.</p>
<p>The strength of Twin Shark Island’s Island Master Zhu Liang was not very high, only First-Order Origin Returning Realm. On such a remote island, it was quite rare for powerful cultivators to appear.</p>
<p>After Yang Kai showed him the token and Luo Lan’s handwritten note, Zhu Liang immediately acknowledged Yang Kai as this place’s new master.</p>
<p>Being able to assume command of Twin Shark Island so smoothly satisfied Yang Kai greatly.</p>
<p>“En, you will remain as Island Master in the future, and you will manage Twin Shark Island as before. I will not interfere in any of your affairs. If there are any problems you cannot handle, you can inform Lady Yue and she will convey it to me.”</p>
<p>“I understand!” Seemingly realizing Yang Kai was easy to get along with, Zhu Liang gradually became less nervous.</p>
<p>“Island Master Zhu…”</p>
<p>“I am just a subordinate,” Zhu Liang responded quickly, “Sir should simply call this Zhu Liang by his name.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently nodded, “Okay, tell me about the situation on Twin Shark Island.”</p>
<p>“Understood!” Zhu Liang gathered his thoughts for a moment before explaining, “Twin Shark Island is approximately one hundred thousand kilometres across and has fairly rich World Energy; however, it doesn’t produce any notable resources, making supplies a slight problem. Currently, there are roughly two hundred thousand residents on the island. The average cultivation level here is not high. Despite his lack of talent, your subordinate here is actually the strongest master on Twin Shark Island at the First-Order Origin Returning Realm. In addition to me, there are three other First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators on the island who serve as the Deputy Island Master and Elders. This lowly one has set up an Elder Council to manage the matters of Twin Shark Island with several elders…”</p>
<p>“Five hundred thousand kilometres east of Twin Shark Island there is a city which is connected via Space Array. In the surrounding million-kilometre region, there are many other islands with similar situations to Twin Shark Island, and the relationship between the islands is fairly peaceful with only occasional contact. The biggest danger here comes from sea beasts. Every year, sea beasts will attack the island, resulting in much damage and loss of life; however, Twin Shark Island will certainly be much safer and more peaceful in the future with Sir here!”</p>
<p>While explaining, Zhu Liang also took the opportunity to flatter Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai paid this no mind though.</p>
<p>Zhu Liang continued, “The biggest output of Twin Shark Island and the nearby islands are the Monster Cores from sea beasts. Every year, many foreign cultivators come to Twin Shark Island to hunt these sea beasts…”</p>
<p>After half an hour of questioning, Yang Kai had a cursory understanding of the situation on Twin Shark Island.</p>
<p>Overall, he was quite satisfied with this place and found it very suitable for his next plan.</p>
<p>However, he needed to find an appropriate location before implementing that plan.</p>
<p>Yang Kai decided to handle this personally.</p>
<p>After dismissing Zhu Liang, Yang Kai assigned Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao some tasks before flying off on his Star Shuttle alone to investigate the terrain of Twin Shark Island.</p>
<p>This survey took Yang Kai eight days to complete.</p>
<p>In the end, Yang Kai chose an area in the southeast that was close to the sea and had excellent scenery. Most importantly though, there was a large amount of open space here with few traces of cultivators ever visiting.</p>
<p>Yang Kai found Zhu Liang again and asked him to recruit some cultivators from Twin Shark Island to build a palace there.</p>
<p>Yang Kai naturally was not going to let others work in vain and offered Saint Crystals as payment.</p>
<p>Would Zhu Liang refuse this golden opportunity? Even if Yang Kai did not pay, he would still do his best to fulfil Yang Kai’s request.</p>
<p>There were two hundred thousand people on Twin Shark Island, so Zhu Liang casually gave an order to recruit a thousand people and had them begin constructing a large palace at the place Yang Kai designated.</p>
<p>The cultivators began immediately and worked at an incredibly fast pace. Within half a month, a magnificent palace was built that stretched across a more than ten-kilometre-wide area.</p>
<p>Zhu Liang even paid out of his own pocket to add some furniture and decorations to the palace.</p>
<p>Once it was finished, Yang Kai moved in with Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao.</p>
<p>The palace was huge and seemed quite quiet and lonely with only four people inside of it.</p>
<p>Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao did not understand why Yang Kai had built such a huge palace here, but knowing it wasn’t their place to ask, they simply obeyed his instructions and served him with dedication.</p>
<p>That night, Yang Kai called them into his room.</p>
<p>“What orders does Young Lord have for us?” Yue Xi asked curiously.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing so serious. Have a seat first,” Yang Kai motioned to them.</p>
<p>After the three women were seated, Yang Kai continued, “Since you have chosen to follow me in the future, then I will not mistreat you. Having said so, I will inform you now that I have a Sect called High Heaven Sect, of which I am the Sect Master. The Sect’s headquarters is on a very remote Cultivation Star. Would you like to join High Heaven Sect?”</p>
<p>The Master and Disciples glanced at each other before looking at Yang Kai and without hesitation nodding together, “Of course we would.”</p>
<p>“En, then from now on, you are members of High Heaven Sect,” Yang Kai smiled and said, “The Sect headquarters is a long way away, so you won’t have an opportunity to visit it in the short term, but rest assured, a day will come when I bring you to see it. High Heaven Sect… in the future, it will not be weak.”</p>

<p>“Someone wants to go with me? Who?” Yang Kai frowned. He hadn’t heard anything about this beforehand.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin glanced to the side and after following his line of sight, Yang Kai saw three familiar faces.</p>
<p>“Young Master Yang!” Yue Xi walked over slowly and stood not far away.</p>
<p>“Big Brother Yang,” He Zao and He Miao also called out cheerfully.</p>
<p>Yang Kai looked at Gu Jian Xin, who shrugged his shoulders and smiled, “I’ve expelled them from Sword Union. As the Young Union Master, I have such rights.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression changed.</p>
<p>“Then, I asked them what they plan to do in the future, and they all said they wanted to follow you. I wonder if you’d be willing to take them in?” Gu Jian Xin added with a grin.</p>

<p>Overall, he was quite satisfied with this place and found it very suitable for his next plan.</p>
<p>However, he needed to find an appropriate location before implementing that plan.</p>
<p>Yang Kai decided to handle this personally.</p>
<p>After dismissing Zhu Liang, Yang Kai assigned Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao some tasks before flying off on his Star Shuttle alone to investigate the terrain of Twin Shark Island.</p>
<p>This survey took Yang Kai eight days to complete.</p>
<p>In the end, Yang Kai chose an area in the southeast that was close to the sea and had excellent scenery. Most importantly though, there was a large amount of open space here with few traces of cultivators ever visiting.</p>
<p>Yang Kai found Zhu Liang again and asked him to recruit some cultivators from Twin Shark Island to build a palace there.</p>
<p>Yang Kai naturally was not going to let others work in vain and offered Saint Crystals as payment.</p>
<p>Would Zhu Liang refuse this golden opportunity? Even if Yang Kai did not pay, he would still do his best to fulfil Yang Kai’s request.</p>
<p>There were two hundred thousand people on Twin Shark Island, so Zhu Liang casually gave an order to recruit a thousand people and had them begin constructing a large palace at the place Yang Kai designated.</p>
<p>The cultivators began immediately and worked at an incredibly fast pace. Within half a month, a magnificent palace was built that stretched across a more than ten-kilometre-wide area.</p>
<p>Zhu Liang even paid out of his own pocket to add some furniture and decorations to the palace.</p>
<p>Once it was finished, Yang Kai moved in with Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao.</p>
<p>The palace was huge and seemed quite quiet and lonely with only four people inside of it.</p>
<p>Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao did not understand why Yang Kai had built such a huge palace here, but knowing it wasn’t their place to ask, they simply obeyed his instructions and served him with dedication.</p>
<p>That night, Yang Kai called them into his room.</p>
<p>“What orders does Young Lord have for us?” Yue Xi asked curiously.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing so serious. Have a seat first,” Yang Kai motioned to them.</p>
<p>After the three women were seated, Yang Kai continued, “Since you have chosen to follow me in the future, then I will not mistreat you. Having said so, I will inform you now that I have a Sect called High Heaven Sect, of which I am the Sect Master. The Sect’s headquarters is on a very remote Cultivation Star. Would you like to join High Heaven Sect?”</p>
<p>The Master and Disciples glanced at each other before looking at Yang Kai and without hesitation nodding together, “Of course we would.”</p>
<p>“En, then from now on, you are members of High Heaven Sect,” Yang Kai smiled and said, “The Sect headquarters is a long way away, so you won’t have an opportunity to visit it in the short term, but rest assured, a day will come when I bring you to see it. High Heaven Sect… in the future, it will not be weak.”</p>

<p>“Someone wants to go with me? Who?” Yang Kai frowned. He hadn’t heard anything about this beforehand.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin glanced to the side and after following his line of sight, Yang Kai saw three familiar faces.</p>
<p>“Young Master Yang!” Yue Xi walked over slowly and stood not far away.</p>
<p>“Big Brother Yang,” He Zao and He Miao also called out cheerfully.</p>
<p>Yang Kai looked at Gu Jian Xin, who shrugged his shoulders and smiled, “I’ve expelled them from Sword Union. As the Young Union Master, I have such rights.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression changed.</p>
<p>“Then, I asked them what they plan to do in the future, and they all said they wanted to follow you. I wonder if you’d be willing to take them in?” Gu Jian Xin added with a grin.</p>
<p>“Many thanks for your kindness, Brother Gu,” Yang Kai said seriously.</p>
<p>With his shrewdness, how could Yang Kai not notice that Gu Jian Xin was doing him a favour? After all, he was just a lone wanderer on Azure Tree Star, and although he was strong, there were always some matters that would be inconvenient for Yang Kai to handle in person, so having competent assistants was a necessity.</p>
<p>With Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao following him, the situation would be different. Some of the trivial matters that needed to be attended to could be left to them, and if it was ever inconvenient for Yang Kai to handle something personally, he could ask one of these three to manage it.</p>
<p>This move also spared Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao from enduring some awkward situations in Sword Union in the future. As Yang Kai said before, after the matter regarding Qin Qi Yang was dealt with in such a manner, Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao would find it difficult to remain in Sword Union. No matter where they went, they would be accused of ingratitude.</p>
<p>Now that they had been expelled from Sword Union though, this would no longer be an issue.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin was a sharp individual and was trying to make the best impression he could on Yang Kai, so he had not hesitated to make this move.</p>
<p>This was a kindness to him, so Yang Kai naturally had no reason to refuse.</p>
<p>Turning to Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao, Yang Kai asked solemnly, “Are you willing to follow me?”</p>
<p>“As long as the Young Lord is willing to give us shelter, this Yue Xi is willing to do her best to serve him!” Yue Xi quickly replied.</p>
<p>“We are willing!” The two sisters said in unison.</p>
<p>“Good, then from now on, you will follow me,” Yang Kai nodded.</p>
<p>“Many thanks, Young Lord!” Yue Xi elegant bowed, her face overflowing with joy.</p>
<p>“Little brother…” Luo Lan, who was standing next to him, only spoke up now and said, “As for the Space Spirit Crystals you need, for the time being, this Queen is unable to gather much, but she will do her best to collect some and have them sent to you later. Would that be acceptable?”</p>
<p>“En, I’ll have to trouble Senior with this matter then.”</p>
<p>After Yang Kai chose Twin Shark Island as his site, he asked Gu Jian Xin and Luo Lan to acquire a large amount of Space Spirit Crystals for him, but these things were too scarce, so Luo Lan was unable to acquire a large quantity of them in such a short span of time. However, with her promise, Yang Kai was assured he would get some sooner or later.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Yang Kai took Yue Xi, He Mao, and He Zao, summoned his Star Shuttle, and left the Azure Tree Palace.</p>
<p>Gu Jian Xin and the others watched Yang Kai leave before returning to the palace.</p>
<p>Going to Twin Shark Island would take half a month despite using the Space Arrays on Azure Tree Star.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Yang Kai had the token given to him by Luo Lan, and with it, all the Space Arrays of the major cities on Azure Tree Star were open to him.</p>
<p>Following the route given to him by Luo Lan, Yang Kai travelled through various Space Arrays for half a month before arriving at Twin Shark Island.</p>
<p>Although Twin Shark Island was remote, it still had a Space Array used to connect with the outside world, and when the figures of Yang Kai and his group appeared on the platform, the cultivator responsible for guarding this place immediately came forward and swept his eyes over them before performing his routine duties, “Travelers, what business do you have here on Twin Shark Island?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced at him and found that this person was only a Third-Order Saint King while the other cultivators responsible for guarding this place also were not very strong.</p>
<p>From the level of these cultivators, it could be inferred that the total strength of Twin Shark Island was not very high.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not answer directly and instead took out the token given to him and showed it to this guard.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” The cultivator’s eyes narrowed slightly as a blank expression appeared on his face.</p>
<p>“You don’t know?” Yang Kai frowned, “Well, it doesn’t matter if you don’t know what it is, what is your Island Master’s name and where is he? Take me to see him.”</p>
<p>The cultivator was shocked by Yang Kai’s aggressive questioning and domineering attitude. Although he did not recognize what this token represented, he could faintly guess that Yang Kai had a powerful background.</p>
<p>Immediately fixing his previous careless attitude, he replied suspiciously, “Island Master’s name is Zhu Liang. Dare I ask where these friends come from and how they know Sir Island Master?”</p>
<p>Before Yang Kai could answer, Yue Xi coldly snorted, “Are you qualified to ask about my Young Lord’s identity? Hurry up and lead the way!”</p>
<p>As she spoke, she intentionally released a bit of her Shi, causing the guard to change in complexion and realize that this man and three women were not people he could contend with. As such, he quickly bowed and guided them.</p>
<p>This was another advantage of having confident subordinates. Yue Xi speaking up there would raise Yang Kai’s identity and status and avoid some troublesome inquiries.</p>
<p>Yang Kai shot Yue Xi an approving look, to which the latter responded with a smile.</p>
<p>The strength of Twin Shark Island’s Island Master Zhu Liang was not very high, only First-Order Origin Returning Realm. On such a remote island, it was quite rare for powerful cultivators to appear.</p>
<p>After Yang Kai showed him the token and Luo Lan’s handwritten note, Zhu Liang immediately acknowledged Yang Kai as this place’s new master.</p>
<p>Being able to assume command of Twin Shark Island so smoothly satisfied Yang Kai greatly.</p>
<p>“En, you will remain as Island Master in the future, and you will manage Twin Shark Island as before. I will not interfere in any of your affairs. If there are any problems you cannot handle, you can inform Lady Yue and she will convey it to me.”</p>
<p>“I understand!” Seemingly realizing Yang Kai was easy to get along with, Zhu Liang gradually became less nervous.</p>
<p>“Island Master Zhu…”</p>
<p>“I am just a subordinate,” Zhu Liang responded quickly, “Sir should simply call this Zhu Liang by his name.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently nodded, “Okay, tell me about the situation on Twin Shark Island.”</p>
<p>“Understood!” Zhu Liang gathered his thoughts for a moment before explaining, “Twin Shark Island is approximately one hundred thousand kilometres across and has fairly rich World Energy; however, it doesn’t produce any notable resources, making supplies a slight problem. Currently, there are roughly two hundred thousand residents on the island. The average cultivation level here is not high. Despite his lack of talent, your subordinate here is actually the strongest master on Twin Shark Island at the First-Order Origin Returning Realm. In addition to me, there are three other First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators on the island who serve as the Deputy Island Master and Elders. This lowly one has set up an Elder Council to manage the matters of Twin Shark Island with several elders…”</p>
<p>“Five hundred thousand kilometres east of Twin Shark Island there is a city which is connected via Space Array. In the surrounding million-kilometre region, there are many other islands with similar situations to Twin Shark Island, and the relationship between the islands is fairly peaceful with only occasional contact. The biggest danger here comes from sea beasts. Every year, sea beasts will attack the island, resulting in much damage and loss of life; however, Twin Shark Island will certainly be much safer and more peaceful in the future with Sir here!”</p>
<p>While explaining, Zhu Liang also took the opportunity to flatter Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai paid this no mind though.</p>
<p>Zhu Liang continued, “The biggest output of Twin Shark Island and the nearby islands are the Monster Cores from sea beasts. Every year, many foreign cultivators come to Twin Shark Island to hunt these sea beasts…”</p>

<h2>Chapter 1753, Masters Floating About Like Clouds</h2>
<p>“Deal?” Yang Kai frowned, “What deal?”</p>
<p>“You really forgot?” Xue Yue looked at him and sneered dismissively, “So that’s how it is, it looks like you were too busy flirting with that enchantress from Monster Emperor Star and completely forgot about what I said.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai grinned as he said, “Is that jealousy I hear…”</p>
<p>“Don’t flatter yourself!” Xue Yue yelled angrily.</p>
<p>“However, how did you know that she came from Monster Emperor Star? Did you investigate her later?” Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at her.</p>
<p>“Did I even need to?” Xue Yue raised her chin slightly and coldly snorted, “Where else but Monster Emperor Star could you find that kind of shameless enchantress?”</p>
<p>“Seems you did inquire about her…” Yang Kai muttered to himself. “Forget it, enough about that. I remember the deal you mentioned.”</p>
<p>“Took you long enough, where is it now then?”</p>
<p>“You mean the Stone Tablet which came out of the Stone Monument?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned slightly. Naturally, he remembered the scene from that time and about the transaction between himself and Xue Yue. Xue Yue had said at the time that as long as he handed over the stone tablet, the grievances between her and Yang Kai would be wiped clean and she would never trouble him again.</p>
<p>At that time, Yang Kai had also agreed, but before he could hand the stone tablet over to Xue Yue, the Emperor Garden closed without warning, resulting in them being unable to complete the exchange.</p>
<p>Later, Yang Kai learned that what was hidden in the stone tablet was the shocking Star Refining Art Secret Technique!</p>
<p>This was a supreme Secret Technique which allowed one to refine a Star Source, thus becoming a Star Master. Little Senior Sister Xia Ning Chang had been able to refine Tong Xuan Realm’s Star Source at the Saint King Realm for two reasons, one was because Tong Xuan Realm had grown incredibly weak and second because of the Star Refining Art.</p>
<p>If either of these two factors had been missing, with Xia Ning Chang’s cultivation at the time, she would not have been able to successfully refine Tong Xuan Realm’s Star Source and become its Star Master.</p>
<p>This was undoubtedly a Secret Technique that could shake the very foundation of the Star Field and set off a massive, bloody war. Its value was simply immeasurable.</p>
<p>Knowing nothing about the Star Refining Art, Yang Kai had not had any qualms about exchanging it for his peace of mind, but now that he did, it was, of course, impossible for him to hand it over easily, even if the other party was Xue Yue.</p>
<p>The relationship between the two of them was still somewhat unclear, so how could Yang Kai just give her such an incredible Secret Technique casually?</p>
<p>“Do you know what is recorded on that stone tablet?” Yang Kai asked seriously.</p>
<p>“I don’t know!” Xue Yue shook her head.</p>
<p>“You don’t know but you still want it?”</p>
<p>“Although I do not know what is recorded on it, I know it is the key to allowing my father to break through to the Third-Order Origin King! So, I have to obtain it!”</p>
<p>“President Ai Ou?” Yang Kai raised his brow.</p>
<p>Xue Yue’s father was naturally President Ai Ou of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce. Yang Kai had heard about this famous character before but had never met him. Currently, what Yang Kai knew was that Ai Ou was a Second-Order Origin King that had been unable to break through to the Third-Order for many years. Even so, with the backing of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, Ai Ou was not an existence that could be underestimated.</p>
<p>“Yes, so I hope you can give me that stone tablet so I can give it to my father!” Xue Yue looked at Yang Kai sincerely.</p>
<p>“How can you be so certain of what is recorded on it? Why are you confident that your father can break through to the Third-Order after obtaining it? You don’t even know what it is.”</p>
<p>Xue Yue smiled and said, “My Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce has a glorious inheritance stretching back over ten thousand years, so we possess some information that is not known to the public. This is something you should understand.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded as he pondered to himself.</p>
<p>In a sense, Xue Yue was right. The Star Refining Art may really be the key to Ai Ou’s breakthrough to the Third Order; after all, with the identity and heritage of Ai Ou, a veteran Origin King, and the Star Refining Art, it would not be impossible for him to refine a Star Source, and once he succeeded, he would surely be able to successfully break through after receiving the blessings from that Star Source.</p>
<p>Of course, there would be some unavoidable risks involved in this process, risks that could result in his very Soul being extinguished.</p>
<p>After understanding this though, Yang Kai was also secretly surprised by the information held by Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce. The Star Refining Art was sealed in a Stone Monument deep inside the Emperor Garden, and before the Stone Monument was smashed, Yang Kai had not noticed anything out of the ordinary about it, but it seemed Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce knew about it in advance.</p>
<p>“I hope you can give me that thing!” Xue Yue looked at Yang Kai sincerely, “Even if it’s just a copy, it doesn’t matter. That stone tablet recorded some kind of Secret Technique or Secret Art, right? If that is the case, I don’t need the original stone tablet ontology, a copy will be enough.”</p>
<p>“I need to think about this,” Yang Kai thought for a while before saying.</p>
<p>“No problem,” Xue Yue readily agreed. “But before you make a decision, you’ll have to act together with me.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai chuckled, “With Ni Guang watching, I think it’s impossible for me to get away from you.”</p>
<p>“Who knows, your strongest talent is definitely escaping from trouble, so if I’m not careful, you’ll certainly try to flee,” Xue Yue snorted softly, “That’s why I let Uncle Ni invite you.”</p>
<p>This was Xue Yue’s main purpose in having Ni Guang invite Yang Kai to travel with them! When she saw Yang Kai arrive, Xue Yue knew that it was the perfect opportunity for her to finish the business between them.</p>
<p>“Since we have reached an agreement, let’s go back. The entrance to that place will open soon. Once we enter, do not run around aimlessly,” Yue Xue warned sternly.</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Soon after, the pair returned to the vicinity of the entrance again. Ni Guang still had his eyes closed while Luo Lan also stood aside and waited quietly. Seeing the two reappear, Luo Lan just gently nodded and did not ask anything.</p>
<p>“Xue Yue,” Yang Kai suddenly approached Xue Yue and called out softly.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Xue Yue asked slightly nervously, frowning as she asked, “Can you not get so close?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced at her strangely before asking, “Who are the people here. Do you know?”</p>
<p>Xue Yue said, “Some I know, some I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Then that person… do you know who he is?” Yang Kai said while glancing towards a certain direction.</p>
<p>Xue Yue quietly glanced over in the direction Yang Kai had looked and found an Origin King Realm master covered in thick black Qi with his face completely concealed. The black Qi around this man was like a living creature, twisting and churning in indistinct patterns, giving off an uncomfortable aura that made those nearby shudder.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen or heard of him,” Xue Yue shivered involuntarily, and whispered back, “Why? Is there something wrong with him?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I’m thinking too much, but I’ve felt like he was paying attention to me for a while now,” Yang Kai frowned.</p>
<p>Xue Yue was stunned. Naturally, she didn’t think Yang Kai was imagining things. Yang Kai’s strength was not weak, and if someone was spying on him, he would definitely sense something, so since he had said so, it was very likely the master wrapped in black Qi was paying attention to him.</p>
<p>As if to confirm Yang Kai’s statement, when Xue Yue secretly stole a glance towards the other party, from the thick black Qi a strange, grating cackle rang out.</p>
<p>Xue Yue’s face turned pale.</p>
<p>“This person… is very dangerous. Don’t provoke him,” Ni Guang suddenly opened his eyes and whispered in a serious tone.</p>
<p>“Uncle Ni, what is his background?” Xue Yue asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Ni Guang shook his head, “Of all the Origin Kings I know and know of, none of them are similar to this person, but… this old master can tell he is very strong, possibly not weaker than me.”</p>
<p>“So, he’s also a Second-Order Origin King?”</p>
<p>“I can’t say for certain if he is a Second-Order, only if I fought with him would I be able to confirm it,” Ni Guang said slowly, “Regardless, don’t provoke him. This person’s aura is filled with cold, evil energy, so he must have cultivated some kind of demonic Secret Art.”</p>
<p>“I understand,” Xue Yue nodded obediently.</p>
<p>Next, in order to prevent Yang Kai from provoking someone who he shouldn’t, Xue Yue carefully introduced him to the origins and identities of the Origin Kings present. There were more than ten people present and Xue Yue knew eight of them. The rest she was not certain about but was able to make some guesses.</p>
<p>Yang Kai made sure to remember the appearances and identities of these masters in mind, in case of emergencies.</p>
<p>Outside the entrance, everyone continued to wait quietly.</p>
<p>From time to time, a new Origin King would rush over, find an open spot, and close their eyes to rest.</p>
<p>About three days later, a bright stream of purple light, which was particularly eye-catching, suddenly appeared from the distant Starry Sky.</p>
<p>When this purple light appeared, Ni Guang suddenly opened his eyes and stared deeply towards it, a slight frown appearing on his face as he coldly muttered, “That old dog also came…”</p>
<p>He seemed to know the identity of this person at a glance.</p>
<p>“Oh well, since he’s come, we can get started,” Ni Guang muttered again.</p>
<p>The aura which radiated from this purple stream of light was extremely powerful, not at all under Ni Guang’s, so it was apparent that whoever had arrived was a master at the Second-Order Origin King Realm. Aware of this, the faces of the First-Order Origin Kings who had already arrived changed slightly. Only the figure wrapped in black Qi let out a strange laugh, not caring at all about this new arrival.</p>
<p>Soon, the purple light arrived nearby and came to a stop before rapidly dissipating, revealing two figures.</p>
<p>Both of these two had a similar body shape, strong and burly, as if they had been carved from the same mould. On top of that, they both shared the same long purple hair which draped down over their shoulders, giving them a free and unrestrained appearance.</p>
<p>The two looked like brothers.</p>
<p>However, if one looked closely, they would realize this was not the case, because the cultivation gap between the two was quite large. One of them was a Second-Order Origin King while the other was just a Third-Order Origin Realm cultivator, the same as Xue Yue and Yang Kai.</p>
<p>After these two appeared, their eyes swept around the crowd and soon fixed on the pair from Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Ni Guang and the Second-Order Origin King master exchanged looks…</p>
<p>Xue Yue’s gaze collided with the Third-Order Origin Realm cultivator…</p>
<p>Neither side showed weakness, not even flinching, their expressions remaining calm.</p>
<p>“Hahaha!” A loud burst of laughter sounded soon after as the purple-haired Second-Order Origin King boldly called out, “It seems this old master has come a little late and made everyone wait.”</p>
<p>“No one was waiting for you, Zi Long. Stop flattering yourself!” Ni Guang sneered.</p>
<p>“Oh, I thought Brother Ni would have wished I had come here sooner,” Zi Long grinned meaningfully.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1754, Severed World</h2>
<p>“Even without you, this entrance can be opened, it would only take a few more people,” Ni Guang said lightly, “But since you are here, there’s no point in waiting any longer.”</p>
<p>“En. In that case, let’s proceed,” Zi Long smiled.</p>
<p>Hearing the conversation between the two, Yang Kai immediately realized who this man was.</p>
<p>The purple-haired Second-Order Origin King was none other than the Sect Master of Purple Star, Zi Long!</p>
<p>Realizing this, Yang Kai also understood that the Third-Order Origin Realm cultivator beside him was Purple Star’s Young Master, Zi Dong.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was not surprised that Zi Dong was here, because Gu Jian Xin had mentioned that Zi Dong and Xue Yue could be placed on equal footing with him, which meant Gu Jian Xin had acknowledged Zi Dong’s strength.</p>
<p>These three young ‘men’ were the most famous talents in the entire Star Field! Because the three of them represented the three different super forces and were considered future successors to them.</p>
<p>Under these three, there were also many other famous rising stars.</p>
<p>Such as the disciple of Senior Wu Dao, Xu Bin Bai, Shan Qing Luo of Monster Emperor Star and the heirs to the several Monster Race Tribal Lords; however, none had reputations as loud as these three.</p>
<p>It was undeniable that the future of the Star Field would be dominated by these people.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t know if there was some kind of grievances between Zi Dong and Xue Yue, or if it was just the competitive spirit of the younger generation, but as soon as these two met, both of them seemed eager to fight one another, creating some tension in the air.</p>
<p>But now was not a good time for such things.</p>
<p>The arrival of Zi Long allowed the entrance to be opened, so with Ni Guang and Zi Long taking charge, all of the gathered Origin Kings began preparing.</p>
<p>After a brief discussion, the Origin Kings on the scene scattered around, each assuming a position near the entrance, waiting intently.</p>
<p>“Then… shall we begin?” Zi Long cast his gaze over to Ni Guang and asked inquisitively.</p>
<p>Ni Guang nodded lightly, and in the next moment, a majestic Saint Qi burst out of his body as he formed a complex series of signs with his hands before pushing his hands forward.</p>
<p>A beam of energy visible to the naked eye shot out from his palms and poured into the white circular entrance.</p>
<p>Zi Long let out a hearty laugh and also began pouring his Saint Qi into the entrance.</p>
<p>The other Origin Kings present followed suit one after another, even the man wrapped in black Qi who had yet to reveal his face, and appeared incredibly suspicious, did not slack off and cooperated with everyone else in this act.</p>
<p>Soon, a humming sound rang out from the white entrance and the Void Cracks which had originally been freely flowing about seemed to be restrained by an invisible power, freezing in place.</p>
<p>As for the entrance itself, it seemed to have become a bottomless pit, devouring all the Saint Qi poured into it by the many Origin Kings present without showing any signs of stopping.</p>
<p>Among all the people present, only Yang Kai, Xue Yue, and Zi Dong, who were Origin Realm cultivators, did not participate and simply watched from the sidelines.</p>
<p>This was not a surprise though, as they were still incomparable to true Origin Kings no matter how good their aptitude was, or how profound their heritage was. What they could contribute to this kind of forceful opening of the entrance to the Severed World was like a drop of water in the ocean, so instead of wasting their energy, it was better for them to retain their strength to deal with any possible dangers they faced after entering the Severed World.</p>
<p>Time passed slowly.</p>
<p>The expressions of each Origin King became difficult as they continued to pour their Saint Qi into the entrance, causing them a great deal of consumption.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they had prepared a lot of pills to restore their Saint Qi in advance and were taking them regularly to supplement their losses.</p>
<p>The difference in cultivation also became apparent.</p>
<p>For First-Order Origin Kings such as Luo Lan and Cui Hong, their faces now had fine beads of sweat dripping down them and their bodies were trembling slightly. Only the Second-Order masters such as Ni Guang and Zi Long were able to retain a calm image.</p>
<p>More and more Void Cracks became fixed at the entrance, and with the infusion of Saint Qi, the unstable fluctuations of these Void Crack gradually dissipated, leaving behind only stable Void Cracks.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai realized how everyone would enter the Severed World.</p>
<p>Soon after, Yang Kai’s conjectures were proven correct. When the number of stable Void Cracks reached a certain number around the primary white entrance, Ni Guang suddenly shouted, “Good!”</p>
<p>As soon as these words fell, all the Origin Kings stopped pouring in their Saint Qi into the void, picked one of the stable Void Cracks, and dashed inside.</p>
<p>After someone passed through one of the stabilized Void Cracks, the Void Crack started to destabilize and begin flitting about again.</p>
<p>Ni Guang and Luo Lan stood side by side, beckoned to Yang Kai and Xue Yue, and after converging together, released their Saint Qi and rushed towards the biggest Void Crack.</p>
<p>From a short distance away, a purple streak of light flew past and Zi Long’s laughter rang out, “Brother Ni, this old master will be going on ahead. Make sure you don’t die inside!”</p>
<p>As soon as these words came out, Zi Long took Zi Dong and disappeared into one of the entrances.</p>
<p>Ni Guang coldly snorted and rushed into the largest Void Crack.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the surrounding space became silent and empty.</p>
<p>After everyone disappeared, the entrances began to warp and distort, with more and more Void Cracks constantly emerging, turning the temporarily stable region into one filled with even more danger than before. It was conceivable that even if just as many Origin Kings gathered here, they would be unable to open the entrance again.</p>
<p>If one wanted to enter this place, they could only wait for the next opportunity, and when that would be was completely unknown.</p>
<p>After Yang Kai followed Luo Lan into the Void Crack, he felt a sense of weightlessness, as if he was falling towards an endless abyss and his Soul felt a great deal of pressure. These were all telltale signs of a substantial spatial transmission.</p>
<p>Yang Kai could perceive that Luo Lan was working hard to resist the pressure coming at her from all directions, but such a transmission was really nothing to him; after all, he was proficient in Space Force. So he had long adapted to this kind of Space Force pressure.</p>
<p>The entire transmission process was extremely fast, almost feeling like a single flash before Yang Kai’s eyes were greeted by a completely different world’s scenery.</p>
<p>The sky was dim, and chaotic energy fluctuations abounded. There was no sun, nor moon, nor stars. The land was dry and desolate, without a single blade of grass and only dried up, cracked ravines.</p>
<p>The place where everyone appeared was in midair, so as soon as they entered, they immediately descended to the ground.</p>
<p>Yang Kai turned his head around and found that Ni Guang, Xue Yue, and Luo Lan were all there.</p>
<p>However, no one else seemed to be around.</p>
<p>This was also easy to understand; after all, each group entered this place through different Void Cracks, and for each Void Crack, there would naturally be a different teleportation location.</p>
<p>Circulating their Saint Qi, the four descended lightly, with Ni Guang and Luo Lan both showing relieved expressions.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, we didn’t appear somewhere dangerous,” Luo Lan said softly while Ni Guang nodded in agreement, feeling their luck was already quite good.</p>
<p>It was not always a smooth process for Origin Kings to enter the Severed World. Without even mentioning the many crises that could not be resolved by Origin Kings in this place, it was even said that there were dangers one could encounter upon entering this place that would pose a threat to ordinary Origin Kings.</p>
<p>Other than encountering an extremely powerful Monster Beast, it was entirely possible to fall as soon as one entered this place.</p>
<p>There were many Ninth-Order Monster Beasts here, with a few Tenth-Order Monster Beasts as well. There were even rumours about legendary Eleventh-Order and Twelfth-Order Monster Beasts existing here…</p>
<p>But luck seemed to be on their side for now.</p>
<p>After landing, Yang Kai noticed that this place was quite different from the Star Field.</p>
<p>The World Principles here seemed to be extremely powerful, and while his Saint Qi and Spiritual Energy did not seem to be affected… his Shi was quite heavily suppressed.</p>
<p>Trying to release his Shi, Yang Kai found that it was less than half as powerful as normal.</p>
<p>Perceiving his movements, Xue Yue said to the side, “Don’t bother, everyone is like this. Not only our Shi, but even Uncle Ni’s Domain is suppressed here. The World Principles here are powerful and profound, having a strong impact on both Shi and Domain.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded lightly; his expression slightly relaxed.</p>
<p>Ni Guang looked around and released his Divine Sense. Only after confirming that there was nothing that could threaten him nearby, he turned his head to Luo Lan and said, “Elder Luo, what are you planning to do next?”</p>
<p>Luo Lan was startled and asked suspiciously, “Senior Ni means…”</p>
<p>Ni Guang pondered for a while before saying, “Let me be blunt, the reason this old master invited you was because Third Young Master wanted the young man accompanying us. As for Elder Luo, you were not part of this consideration. Before we entered this place, this old master did not have anything to say, but now that we are inside, this old master would like to clarify if you intend to act together with us or alone? Let me say this first though, this young man must accompany this old master.”</p>
<p>Although he did not know why Xue Yue insisted on having Yang Kai come with them, he knew that Xue Yue never did anything without a purpose.</p>
<p>Since Xue Yue wanted to keep Yang Kai close, she must have a good reason.</p>
<p>Seeing Luo Lan sink in contemplation, Ni Guang said, “If you come with this old master, it will be much safer for you, but this old master won’t guarantee you will gain any benefits. If you separate from this old master, although the risks will be higher, if you can obtain some rare opportunity here, it will be worthwhile.”</p>
<p>What Ni Guang meant was that even if they found something good here, he would not give anything to Luo Lan unless she contributed enough strength to help obtain it.</p>
<p>“I understand,” Luo Lan nodded, “But… I still want to travel with you; after all, Yang Kai was brought here by me, so this Mistress cannot just abandon him here.”</p>
<p>She did not dare act alone without Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Before learning that Yang Kai was proficient in Space Force, Luo Lan had not even planned on coming to the Severed World. She had received word of this place’s opening some time ago, but since she could not guarantee her own safety, she had not thought about entering.</p>
<p>Her coming here was a decision she made almost entirely based on knowing Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space.</p>
<p>As such, she did not want to be separated from Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Seeing her make this choice, Ni Guang didn’t show any change in expression, “If that is the case, we’ll go together. Just curious, Elder Luo: What is the main goal of your trip?”</p>
<p>Luo Lan glanced over at Yang Kai, pursed her lips, and smiled, “I have no special goal in mind, I simply planned to explore at will.”</p>
<p>She did not dare to say she was after a Shocking Void Beast, otherwise, with Ni Guang’s shrewdness, he would definitely be able to infer something.</p>

<p>The group of four people decided to find a nearby place to adjust their breathing after some discussions; after all, the process of opening the entrance to the Severed World had caused both Ni Guang and Luo Lan to consume a great deal of their Saint Qi just now. In a place like this, which was filled with crisis, they needed to maintain their peak condition in order to cope with whatever they may encounter next.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was not any obvious danger nearby, so Ni Guang simply led the group to the bottom of a ravine to conceal themselves.</p>
<p>The ravines here were quite deep and narrow, spreading out in all directions like a series of long canyons. After flying down and looking up, only a faint light could be seen, indicating they were at least a couple thousand metres below the surface.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the ravine, a chilly wind gusted continuously.</p>
<p>Yang Kai and Xue Yue were still at full strength, and although they were not Origin Kings, their strength wasn’t weak, so they were responsible for standing guard.</p>
<p>Ni Guang and Luo Lan each chose a location not far apart, took some pills, and sat down cross-legged to meditate.</p>
<p>Yang Kai guarded Luo Lan while Xue Yue guarded Ni Guang, each side performing their own duties.</p>
<p>The world seemed silent, with only the noise of the blustering wind echoing through the gully adding to the eerie stillness.</p>
<p>Xue Yue glanced around from time to time, seeming a little nervous.</p>
<p>Regardless of how high her cultivation was or how strong she was, she was still a woman. So, in such a gloomy environment, she instinctually became more vigilant.</p>
<p>Yang Kai wore an indifferent look as he simply closed his eyes and released his Divine Sense to monitor the surroundings to avoid any accidents.</p>
<p>Time passed slowly, and after an unknown period, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes…</p>
<p>He found himself lying on a bed, one that was wooden and quite uncomfortable. Looking up, he saw a simple roof which had holes in it and was leaking air everywhere. Turning around, the furnishings in this house were extremely sparse, with only a simple table and a chair, nothing else.</p>
<p>The scene felt quite familiar. Yang Kai could not help showing some doubt on his face as his mind felt hazy, making it impossible for him to think straight.</p>
<p>He instinctively felt that something was wrong, as if he had forgotten something important, and tried hard to remember, but this only caused a sharp pain in his head.</p>
<p>He could not even remember what he was doing before.</p>
<p>Shaking his head, Yang Kai got up from the simple wooden bed before opening the door and walking out. Standing in front of the small house, he took a look around…</p>
<p>Memories suddenly flooded back to him like a tide, and Yang Kai immediately recalled that he was currently a Trial Disciple of High Heaven Pavilion, but because he had been here for almost three years yet failed to meet the requirements of the Sect to become a formal disciple, he could only do odd jobs to earn a living while doing his best to cultivate at the same time.</p>
<p>There was a broom outside the house, and at this moment, the sky was not yet bright. It seemed to be the darkest hour before dawn.</p>
<p>Yang Kai could not help chuckling before stepping forward, picking up the broom, and beginning his day’s work.</p>
<p>The Sect had various roads which lead from the Contribution Hall, to the Training Hall, the Martial Skills Hall, and so on. All of which had the shadow of Yang Kai’s busy figure. All the roads were cleaned by him as he was the lowest-level disciple of High Heaven Pavilion, little more than a labourer.</p>
<p>As the sun rose and the day became light, many of Yang Kai’s fellow brothers gathered around, ready to challenge him.</p>
<p>In the end, a Junior Brother who only had a Fourth Stage Tempered Body cultivation won the right to challenge him, proceeded to trounce Yang Kai, then left.</p>
<p>Lying on the ground, breathing heavily, feeling his weakness and physical pain, Yang Kai slowly clenched his fists.</p>
<p>Subconsciously, his gaze shifted towards a big tree not far away.</p>
<p>Atop the big tree, there was a figure standing quietly, her face difficult to see because it was covered by a thin veil. Her figure was slim and there was a small sapphire which adorned her brow, giving her a pure and flawless appearance.</p>
<p>Yang Kai looked at her quietly, inexplicably feeling that this woman was incredibly important to him, but unable to understand why he felt this way.</p>
<p>Their eyes only met for a moment before the veiled woman’s body flickered and disappeared.</p>
<p>The disappearance of this woman caused Yang Kai to feel a little pain in his heart, as if it was being gripped by a strong hand, making it difficult for him to breath. Yang Kai shook his head and picked himself up off the ground with difficulty, collected his broom off the ground, then step by step returned to his little cabin.</p>
<p>In the end, he failed to meet the Sect’s requirements before the time limit and ultimately failed to become a true disciple of High Heaven Pavilion…</p>
<p>Having been expelled from High Heaven Pavilion, Yang Kai quietly packed up his things into a small sack then descended the mountain road he had walked countless times before.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the mountain gate, Yang Kai looked back at the plaque engraved with the three words ‘High Heaven Pavilion’ and paused, as his thoughts fluttered.</p>
<p>He was only fifteen years old now, but his future had already been lost.</p>
<p>At the base of the mountain, a group of Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters were walking over, headed by a certain person holding a sword in her hand, her temperament as cold and clear as ice jade. She was like an ice fairy, exquisite and unblemished. She wore a pure white dress which was unstained by even the slightest bit of dust and was like the bright moon around which the stars gathered. Standing in the middle of her group, which was laughing and chatting, she soon arrived near Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Perceiving his abnormal state, the lead woman stopped, turned to Yang Kai, and lightly opened her lips, “Junior Brother, are you descending the mountain?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai turned his head and looked towards the source of the voice, but after seeing the other person’s face, he could not help feeling startled and blurting out, “Su Yan…”</p>
<p>As soon as he spoke this name though, Yang Kai became startled. Although he had been in High Heaven Pavilion for three years now and was familiar with this Eldest Senior Sister, even witnessing her heroic posture many times, the two of them had never exchanged a single word.</p>
<p>After all, the Eldest Senior Sister of High Heaven Pavilion was a lofty, aloof existence while Yang Kai was just a Trial Disciple, there was too much of a difference in strength and identity between them to simply casually chat.</p>
<p>He did not know why he would suddenly call out the other party’s name, and with such familiarity, as if he had called it countless times. It was as if he had done so in a state of dream-like reverie.</p>
<p>Su Yan’s brow furrowed, but her expression did not change much; however, the few Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters who were accompanying her, who were all not weak, immediately cast contemptuous eyes towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>One of the more hot-tempered Senior Brothers even coldly snorted and without the slightest trace of politeness snapped, “Eldest Senior Sister’s name is not one you are qualified to call out!”</p>
<p>As soon as these words fell, a palm slapped towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>A residual palm wind blew past him as Yang Kai was lifted up and thrown through the air, tumbling a few times before hitting the ground, blood overflowing from his mouth, his clothes covered in dust, making him look quite dishevelled.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was indifferent to the physical pain though and continued to frown as he fell to the ground, as if he had fallen into deep thought.</p>
<p>He did not understand why things were like this, all so familiar yet at the same time completely unfamiliar to him…</p>
<p>A fragrant wind brushed past Yang Kai’s nose in the next second as he saw a pair of jade feet land not far away. Looking up, he could see the beautiful and awe-inspiring image of Su Yan standing before him, like an immortal fairy.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Sister, don’t bother with him!” The Senior Brother who hit Yang Kai before coldly snorted with an unhappy look on his face.</p>
<p>Su Yan did not respond to him though and instead stretched out her hand to Yang Kai, as if she wanted to help him up.</p>
<p>Yang Kai hesitated for a moment before reaching out, taking Su Yan’s palm gently, and picking himself up.</p>
<p>The Senior Brother who already had a low opinion of Yang Kai now wore a twisted face as he glared at him with clear rage and hatred. Never had he expected that he had allowed Yang Kai to touch Eldest Senior Sister’s hand because of a simple beating.</p>
<p>Yang Kai stood dumbly on the spot while Su Yan stretched out her hand and patted the dust off his body, the seemingly eternal coldness on her face giving way to a slight warmth.</p>
<p>This gentle appearance stunned Yang Kai into a kind of trance.</p>
<p>“The outside world is extremely dangerous. After Junior Brother descends the mountain, he should set off as early as possible and be careful on the road. The sooner you depart, the earlier you will return,” Su Yan exhorted lightly before taking a deep look at Yang Kai then turning around and continuing on towards High Heaven Pavilion.</p>
<p>Yang Kai just stood in place and watched her leave, his heart feeling inexplicably empty as her figure slowly faded.</p>
<p>From the distance, the ridicule of the Senior Brother who had hit Yang Kai drifted over vaguely, “Eldest Senior Sister, that guy is just a Trial Disciple who was expelled from Sect and will never return, there’s no need to worry about him…”</p>
<p>“Is that so…” Su Yan’s voice sounded lightly. “He should be back.”</p>
<p>The beautiful woman’s figure continued into the distance until it finally disappeared.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s gaze turned towards a different spot next, and in a remote corner, he saw another familiar Senior Sister wearing a green dress and a white veil covering her face standing there quietly.</p>
<p>A sudden gust of wind blew past at that moment, moving her veil and allowing Yang Kai to see her red lips moving slightly, as if she was saying something to him.</p>
<p>However, they were too far apart and Yang Kai was unable to hear what she said clearly. Before he could ask though, this Senior Sister disappeared.</p>
<p>In the end… all he ever learned about this Senior Sister was her name.</p>
<p>Xia Ning Chang!</p>
<p>For some reason, this was a name he felt he would remember for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Yang Kai picked up his bag which had fallen to the ground, turned around, and strode away.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not take part in the Yang Family Inheritance War in the Central Capital because he wasn’t strong enough and was unable to win over any support. Even participating would have been pointless.</p>
<p>His Eldest Brother Yang Wei successfully became the next candidate for Yang Family Patriarch with his own extraordinary strength and prestige, earning him the hopes of the family and their vigorous training.</p>
<p>Time flew by and soon, Yang Kai turned eighteen.</p>
<p>His father, Yang Ying Feng, and his mother, Dong Su Zhu, arranged a marriage for him. The other party was a woman from his mother’s family, and they were considered a good match.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not have much choice in the matter of course. His persistent pursuit of the Martial Dao had yielded almost no gains, and as a member of the Yang Family, he had to at least contribute something to the Yang Family by leaving behind descendants.</p>
<p>He married the woman smoothly and fathered a few children.</p>
<p>During the day, he would work hard in one of the Yang Family’s businesses and at night he would return to his home and spend a pleasant time with his family. His wife and children were always obedient and respectful to him.</p>
<p>He lived a very happy family life.</p>
<p>But… somewhere in Yang Kai’s heart, he could not help feeling something was wrong.</p>
<p>He felt that his life shouldn’t be like this, that he should have had some kind of Heaven defying opportunity which set him on a completely different path.</p>
<p>He tried to dispel such absurd thoughts but found that, like wine, the longer they fermented, the stronger they became, not dispersing but instead threatening to burst out at any moment.</p>

In a place like this, which was filled with crisis, they needed to maintain their peak condition in order to cope with whatever they may encounter next.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was not any obvious danger nearby, so Ni Guang simply led the group to the bottom of a ravine to conceal themselves.</p>
<p>The ravines here were quite deep and narrow, spreading out in all directions like a series of long canyons. After flying down and looking up, only a faint light could be seen, indicating they were at least a couple thousand metres below the surface.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the ravine, a chilly wind gusted continuously.</p>
<p>Yang Kai and Xue Yue were still at full strength, and although they were not Origin Kings, their strength wasn’t weak, so they were responsible for standing guard.</p>
<p>Ni Guang and Luo Lan each chose a location not far apart, took some pills, and sat down cross-legged to meditate.</p>
<p>Yang Kai guarded Luo Lan while Xue Yue guarded Ni Guang, each side performing their own duties.</p>
<p>The world seemed silent, with only the noise of the blustering wind echoing through the gully adding to the eerie stillness.</p>
<p>Xue Yue glanced around from time to time, seeming a little nervous.</p>
<p>Regardless of how high her cultivation was or how strong she was, she was still a woman. So, in such a gloomy environment, she instinctually became more vigilant.</p>
<p>Yang Kai wore an indifferent look as he simply closed his eyes and released his Divine Sense to monitor the surroundings to avoid any accidents.</p>
<p>Time passed slowly, and after an unknown period, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes…</p>
<p>He found himself lying on a bed, one that was wooden and quite uncomfortable. Looking up, he saw a simple roof which had holes in it and was leaking air everywhere. Turning around, the furnishings in this house were extremely sparse, with only a simple table and a chair, nothing else.</p>
<p>The scene felt quite familiar. Yang Kai could not help showing some doubt on his face as his mind felt hazy, making it impossible for him to think straight.</p>
<p>He instinctively felt that something was wrong, as if he had forgotten something important, and tried hard to remember, but this only caused a sharp pain in his head.</p>
<p>He could not even remember what he was doing before.</p>
<p>Shaking his head, Yang Kai got up from the simple wooden bed before opening the door and walking out. Standing in front of the small house, he took a look around…</p>
<p>Memories suddenly flooded back to him like a tide, and Yang Kai immediately recalled that he was currently a Trial Disciple of High Heaven Pavilion, but because he had been here for almost three years yet failed to meet the requirements of the Sect to become a formal disciple, he could only do odd jobs to earn a living while doing his best to cultivate at the same time.</p>
<p>There was a broom outside the house, and at this moment, the sky was not yet bright. It seemed to be the darkest hour before dawn.</p>
<p>Yang Kai could not help chuckling before stepping forward, picking up the broom, and beginning his day’s work.</p>
<p>The Sect had various roads which lead from the Contribution Hall, to the Training Hall, the Martial Skills Hall, and so on. All of which had the shadow of Yang Kai’s busy figure. All the roads were cleaned by him as he was the lowest-level disciple of High Heaven Pavilion, little more than a labourer.</p>
<p>As the sun rose and the day became light, many of Yang Kai’s fellow brothers gathered around, ready to challenge him.</p>
<p>In the end, a Junior Brother who only had a Fourth Stage Tempered Body cultivation won the right to challenge him, proceeded to trounce Yang Kai, then left.</p>
<p>Lying on the ground, breathing heavily, feeling his weakness and physical pain, Yang Kai slowly clenched his fists.</p>
<p>Subconsciously, his gaze shifted towards a big tree not far away.</p>
<p>Atop the big tree, there was a figure standing quietly, her face difficult to see because it was covered by a thin veil. Her figure was slim and there was a small sapphire which adorned her brow, giving her a pure and flawless appearance.</p>
<p>Yang Kai looked at her quietly, inexplicably feeling that this woman was incredibly important to him, but unable to understand why he felt this way.</p>
<p>Their eyes only met for a moment before the veiled woman’s body flickered and disappeared.</p>
<p>The disappearance of this woman caused Yang Kai to feel a little pain in his heart, as if it was being gripped by a strong hand, making it difficult for him to breath. Yang Kai shook his head and picked himself up off the ground with difficulty, collected his broom off the ground, then step by step returned to his little cabin.</p>
<p>In the end, he failed to meet the Sect’s requirements before the time limit and ultimately failed to become a true disciple of High Heaven Pavilion…</p>
<p>Having been expelled from High Heaven Pavilion, Yang Kai quietly packed up his things into a small sack then descended the mountain road he had walked countless times before.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the mountain gate, Yang Kai looked back at the plaque engraved with the three words ‘High Heaven Pavilion’ and paused, as his thoughts fluttered.</p>
<p>He was only fifteen years old now, but his future had already been lost.</p>
<p>At the base of the mountain, a group of Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters were walking over, headed by a certain person holding a sword in her hand, her temperament as cold and clear as ice jade. She was like an ice fairy, exquisite and unblemished. She wore a pure white dress which was unstained by even the slightest bit of dust and was like the bright moon around which the stars gathered. Standing in the middle of her group, which was laughing and chatting, she soon arrived near Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Perceiving his abnormal state, the lead woman stopped, turned to Yang Kai, and lightly opened her lips, “Junior Brother, are you descending the mountain?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai turned his head and looked towards the source of the voice, but after seeing the other person’s face, he could not help feeling startled and blurting out, “Su Yan…”</p>
<p>As soon as he spoke this name though, Yang Kai became startled. Although he had been in High Heaven Pavilion for three years now and was familiar with this Eldest Senior Sister, even witnessing her heroic posture many times, the two of them had never exchanged a single word.</p>
<p>After all, the Eldest Senior Sister of High Heaven Pavilion was a lofty, aloof existence while Yang Kai was just a Trial Disciple, there was too much of a difference in strength and identity between them to simply casually chat.</p>
<p>He did not know why he would suddenly call out the other party’s name, and with such familiarity, as if he had called it countless times. It was as if he had done so in a state of dream-like reverie.</p>
<p>Su Yan’s brow furrowed, but her expression did not change much; however, the few Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters who were accompanying her, who were all not weak, immediately cast contemptuous eyes towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>One of the more hot-tempered Senior Brothers even coldly snorted and without the slightest trace of politeness snapped, “Eldest Senior Sister’s name is not one you are qualified to call out!”</p>
<p>As soon as these words fell, a palm slapped towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>A residual palm wind blew past him as Yang Kai was lifted up and thrown through the air, tumbling a few times before hitting the ground, blood overflowing from his mouth, his clothes covered in dust, making him look quite dishevelled.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was indifferent to the physical pain though and continued to frown as he fell to the ground, as if he had fallen into deep thought.</p>
<p>He did not understand why things were like this, all so familiar yet at the same time completely unfamiliar to him…</p>
<p>A fragrant wind brushed past Yang Kai’s nose in the next second as he saw a pair of jade feet land not far away. Looking up, he could see the beautiful and awe-inspiring image of Su Yan standing before him, like an immortal fairy.</p>
<p>“Eldest Senior Sister, don’t bother with him!” The Senior Brother who hit Yang Kai before coldly snorted with an unhappy look on his face.</p>
<p>Su Yan did not respond to him though and instead stretched out her hand to Yang Kai, as if she wanted to help him up.</p>
<p>Yang Kai hesitated for a moment before reaching out, taking Su Yan’s palm gently, and picking himself up.</p>
<p>The Senior Brother who already had a low opinion of Yang Kai now wore a twisted face as he glared at him with clear rage and hatred. Never had he expected that he had allowed Yang Kai to touch Eldest Senior Sister’s hand because of a simple beating.</p>
<p>Yang Kai stood dumbly on the spot while Su Yan stretched out her hand and patted the dust off his body, the seemingly eternal coldness on her face giving way to a slight warmth.</p>
<p>This gentle appearance stunned Yang Kai into a kind of trance.</p>
<p>“The outside world is extremely dangerous. After Junior Brother descends the mountain, he should set off as early as possible and be careful on the road. The sooner you depart, the earlier you will return,” Su Yan exhorted lightly before taking a deep look at Yang Kai then turning around and continuing on towards High Heaven Pavilion.</p>
<p>Yang Kai just stood in place and watched her leave, his heart feeling inexplicably empty as her figure slowly faded.</p>
<p>From the distance, the ridicule of the Senior Brother who had hit Yang Kai drifted over vaguely, “Eldest Senior Sister, that guy is just a Trial Disciple who was expelled from Sect and will never return, there’s no need to worry about him…”</p>
<p>“Is that so…” Su Yan’s voice sounded lightly. “He should be back.”</p>
<p>The beautiful woman’s figure continued into the distance until it finally disappeared.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s gaze turned towards a different spot next, and in a remote corner, he saw another familiar Senior Sister wearing a green dress and a white veil covering her face standing there quietly.</p>
<p>A sudden gust of wind blew past at that moment, moving her veil and allowing Yang Kai to see her red lips moving slightly, as if she was saying something to him.</p>
<p>However, they were too far apart and Yang Kai was unable to hear what she said clearly. Before he could ask though, this Senior Sister disappeared.</p>
<p>In the end… all he ever learned about this Senior Sister was her name.</p>
<p>Xia Ning Chang!</p>
<p>For some reason, this was a name he felt he would remember for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Yang Kai picked up his bag which had fallen to the ground, turned around, and strode away.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not take part in the Yang Family Inheritance War in the Central Capital because he wasn’t strong enough and was unable to win over any support. Even participating would have been pointless.</p>
<p>His Eldest Brother Yang Wei successfully became the next candidate for Yang Family Patriarch with his own extraordinary strength and prestige, earning him the hopes of the family and their vigorous training.</p>
<p>Time flew by and soon, Yang Kai turned eighteen.</p>
<p>His father, Yang Ying Feng, and his mother, Dong Su Zhu, arranged a marriage for him. The other party was a woman from his mother’s family, and they were considered a good match.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not have much choice in the matter of course. His persistent pursuit of the Martial Dao had yielded almost no gains, and as a member of the Yang Family, he had to at least contribute something to the Yang Family by leaving behind descendants.</p>
<p>He married the woman smoothly and fathered a few children.</p>
<p>During the day, he would work hard in one of the Yang Family’s businesses and at night he would return to his home and spend a pleasant time with his family. His wife and children were always obedient and respectful to him.</p>
<p>He lived a very happy family life.</p>
<p>But… somewhere in Yang Kai’s heart, he could not help feeling something was wrong.</p>
<p>He felt that his life shouldn’t be like this, that he should have had some kind of Heaven defying opportunity which set him on a completely different path.</p>
<p>He tried to dispel such absurd thoughts but found that, like wine, the longer they fermented, the stronger they became, not dispersing but instead threatening to burst out at any moment.</p>

<p>He tried to dispel such absurd thoughts but found that, like wine, the longer they fermented, the stronger they became, not dispersing but instead threatening to burst out at any moment.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1758, Unexpected</h2>
<p>As soon as the huge black shadow took shape, it extended two long arms from below like massive whips that flew fiercely through the air like bolts of black lightning.</p>
<p>Feeling the terrifying power contained in these two attacks, Luo Lan’s beautiful face paled, and without hesitation, she bit the tip of her tongue and spat out a mouthful of her Blood Essence towards her dagger before throwing it out in a powerful strike.</p>
<p>A silent collision occurred as the two black arms were temporarily stopped while Luo Lan’s dagger was sent flying.</p>
<p>The attacks that the black shadow could send out after its fusion were countless times stronger than those of its smaller, individual forms!</p>
<p>Soul type artifacts were driven by a cultivator’s Divine Sense, and although their power was immense, if they took damage, it would also damage the user’s Soul. Therefore, when her dagger was knocked through the air, Luo Lan’s pretty face went white and she could not help coughing up a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>Even with her strong First-Order Origin King cultivation, it only took a single exchange for her to be injured.</p>
<p>At this moment, everyone clearly realized the power of these strange shadows.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the group of four had already managed to rush to the top of the ravine and flew high up into the sky. Not daring to remain, they continued to escape higher.</p>
<p>From the depths of the ravine, a terrifying roar sounded at that moment and two massive pitch black arms shot out and transformed into giant claws that grabbed towards the fleeing four.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that their reach wasn’t long enough, and the two giant claws only managed to catch the air a couple of dozen metres below Luo Lan, who was the closest to the ground.</p>
<p>The next moment, the two giant palms slowly retracted and the howling which had filled everyone’s ears until now gradually subsided, the entire world becoming peaceful again.</p>
<p>Ni Guang, who was leading the way, slowed down and finally came to a halt while staring down thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“These things… don’t seem to be capable of chasing after us,” Yang Kai also noticed the situation.</p>
<p>“It would seem so,” Ni Guang nodded, agreeing with Yang Kai’s assessment, “But it’s better not to make assumptions, we’d best leave here first.”</p>
<p>The other three nodded quickly and followed after Ni Guang.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, the group of four settled down in a safe place again, and although their surroundings were still a deserted plain, at least there were no crisscrossing ravines. After confirming that there was no danger around them, the four stopped to rest and recover.</p>
<p>The crisis seemed to be resolved, but even now, everyone felt some lingering fear.</p>
<p>The attack they encountered this time was simply too unpredictable. Before entering the underground ravine, everyone had surveyed the surrounding area and even with two Origin Kings present they still had not been able to avoid being attacked, a truly shocking reality.</p>
<p>“Elder Luo, how are your injuries?” Ni Guang looked at the pale Luo Lan and asked.</p>
<p>“It’s fine, it only slightly damaged my Soul,” Luo Lan frowned and replied.</p>
<p>“That’s good,” Ni Guang felt relieved. He thought that with his cultivation at the Second-Order Origin King Realm, even if it would not be smooth sailing in this Severed World, it was impossible he would face a fatal threat, but after this experience, he didn’t dare think so anymore.</p>
<p>If it were not Yang Kai helping him break free, he didn’t know how long he would have been trapped in that illusion. Perhaps he wouldn’t have ever awoken, and his body would slowly have rotted away, leading to his death.</p>
<p>“Uncle Ni, what were those things?” Xue Yue asked with some lingering fear. The various things she experienced in the illusion before had felt completely real, and even after being awakened by Yang Kai, she still failed to adapt to the real world for some time.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, I’ve never heard of anything like them existing in the Severed World. Does Elder Luo know anything?” Ni Guang shook his head and turned to Luo Lan to ask.</p>
<p>“This Mistress doesn’t know much about the Severed World, but she is certain she has never heard of such strange creatures.”</p>
<p>“It seems that everyone who encountered these things died, so no information about them ever became known,” Ni Guang pondered thoughtfully, “But that’s not a surprise. Judging from the previous situation, those things are extremely proficient at concealing themselves; even this old master was unable to detect their existence. Fortunately, it seems they can only survive in that dark underground environment. As long as we don’t go underground, we should not encounter them again, and… we don’t seem to have been delayed by much. Inside that illusion, this old master felt like he lived many years, but judging from the condition of our bodies, I’d say only an hour or two has passed. The method those creatures possess is truly terrifying!”</p>
<p>Hearing what he said, the other three nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Elder Luo, you should heal your injuries first, once you’ve recovered, we’ll set out again,” Ni Guang turned and said to Luo Lan.</p>
<p>“Then I shall be troubling you. This Mistress will try to be as fast as possible,” Luo Lan said gratefully.</p>
<p>She did not have any kind of friendship with Ni Guang, so, Ni Guang expressing his willingness to wait for her to recover at this time made her feel grateful. This also verified Ni Guang’s character and confirmed he was a good candidate to cooperate with.</p>
<p>Ni Guang was stronger than her, so cooperating with him was naturally in Luo Lan’s interest.</p>
<p>However, this may also have been related to her being willing to cover their retreat just now. Ni Guang’s attitude towards her had obviously become more amicable than it had been when they first set out.</p>
<p>Luo Lan’s luck was quite good. She had brought Yang Kai here to the Severed World because she wanted to rely on his achievements in the Dao of Space to make exploring this place safer, but as a result, she was also able to obtain cooperation from Ni Guang. If not for Yang Kai, Ni Guang wouldn’t have ever invited her to act together.</p>
<p>Taking out some healing pills, Luo Lan sat down and began to tend to the wound on her Soul.</p>
<p>As for Yang Kai, he was currently gazing towards a spot not far away.</p>
<p>He felt that somewhere in the sky over there, was a faint Space Force fluctuation. He could even infer from these energy fluctuations that there was a hidden Void Crack at that location!</p>
<p>It seemed that Luo Lan was right, this Severed World was filled with hidden danger with many Void Cracks floating about that were invisible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>If someone were to rush through rashly, there was a good chance they would be split in half by these The Void Cracks.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at?” Xue Yue suddenly leaned over and asked softly.</p>
<p>He did not know if he was imagining things, but Yang Kai felt that Xue Yue’s attitude towards him had changed slightly since earlier. Before, Xue Yue had only paid attention to him because of their strange entanglement, causing her attitude to be somewhat bitter and sweet at the same time.</p>
<p>But now, her gaze contained a gentleness that had not been there before. Even when they were escaping just now, Xue Yue held onto Yang Kai’s arm tightly and looked completely at ease.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” Yang Kai shook his head, “What happened to you? What did you experience in that illusion just now? With your mental fortitude, it should not have affected you so deeply, right?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai had only asked casually, but to his surprise, Xue Yue turned bright red, as if she was remembering something embarrassing, and snorted loudly, “None of your business!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nearly choked seeing this and could not help sneering, “Forget it, just pretend I never asked. It definitely must have been nothing good.”</p>
<p>Xue Yue grit her teeth and glared at him, causing Yang Kai to immediately become uncomfortable and quickly look around for something to divert his attention.</p>
<p>It was then that he noticed that Ni Guang had taken out an animal skin map and was frowning as he stared at it. As if looking for something, he would release his Divine Sense from time to time while comparing his observations of the surrounding terrain with the map.</p>
<p>There did not seem to be any clear markings on the map, mostly just a series of intersecting lines as well as some specific locations marked with different symbols.</p>
<p>“Your chamber of commerce possesses a map of this place?” Yang Kai looked surprised.</p>
<p>Xue Yue grinned and said, “What’s so strange about that? It is not the first time that people from our chamber of commerce have come to this place, so having a map or two is nothing to fuss about. However, the Severed World is too big and it’s impossible to grasp its complete layout. Uncle Ni only has a map detailing a small portion of this place.”</p>
<p>“So that’s how it is,” Yang Kai nodded, “In that case, do you have a clear destination for this trip?”</p>
<p>“En, we planned to go to a medicine valley where there are spirit medicines and herbs that aren’t present in the Star Field. Legend has it that there are even herbs which are beyond the Origin King Grade and can bring back the dead, rejuvenate and prolong a person’s life, and some that can even increase the strength of a person directly…”</p>
<p>Listening to her talk, Yang Kai could not help staring at Xue Yue strangely.</p>
<p>“What?” Xue Yue asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>“You really don’t have any guard up against me at all. It’s not like you,” Yang Kai smiled. Although they were in a cooperative relationship right now, what Xue Yue revealed was undoubtedly extremely important information that should be kept confidential.</p>
<p>She was not the type of woman with a big chest but no brains, otherwise, she would never have been able to become the Young Master of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Her revealing so much to him for no apparent reason really surprised Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Hearing what he said, Xue Yue gawked for a moment before seeming to realize something and immediately turning her gaze aside and sneering, “What’s wrong with telling you? With Uncle Ni here, can you even snatch anything from us?”</p>
<p>The tone of her voice clearly indicated she wanted to move past this, so Yang Kai did not ask anymore.</p>
<p>However, upon thinking about it, Yang Kai realized that Luo Lan’s actions this time were a bit too rash. Ni Guang dared to enter this place because he had confidence in his tyrannical strength and because he had prepared thoroughly while Luo Lan, on the other hand, seemed to have simply come on a whim together with Yang Kai and didn’t understand much about the Severed World.</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>In the underground ravine where Yang Kai and the others had just been, an hour after they left, a figure fell from the sky and landed nearby.</p>
<p>His whole body was wrapped in a black Qi, exuding an evil and violent aura. It was none other than the Origin King who had been paying attention to Yang Kai outside before.</p>
<p>After this person landed, he glanced around and, after taking a deep breath, began to cackle wickedly, “Very good, he had been here recently. Yang Boy, this is truly unexpected. Who could have imagined you’d grow to this level after not seeing you for only a few dozen years.”</p>
<p>If Yang Kai heard this, he would definitely be shocked since this unknown Origin King actually seemed to know him, and know him quite well at that.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1759, Immortal Tree</h2>
<p>“Oh…” The strange Origin King stopped suddenly, as if he had just discovered something, and turned towards the underground ravine, using his Divine Sense to survey it. After a while, he let out a burst of wicked laughter and muttered to himself, “There’s actually such a thing here. Although I do not know what you are, you’re useful to this old master.”</p>
<p>Saying so, he jumped directly into the ravine.</p>
<p>As soon as he landed, countless small black shadows sprang out from the crevices lining the ground in all directions and leapt towards him like starving beasts.</p>
<p>This man wasn’t afraid though and instead excitedly shouted, “Haha, good, good. Come!”</p>
<p>Saying so, he summoned a large black flag that immediately released a series of wailing howls. These howls drowned out the scattered cries of the dark shadows and from the flag, numerous twisted, phantom-like human faces appeared.</p>
<p>Forming a series of seals with his hands, the strange master poured his Saint Qi into the black flag and shouted, “Go!”</p>
<p>In the next moment, the black flag turned into a giant black curtain that shrouded the surrounding region and, as if they had encountered their nemesis, the small black shadows were easily suppressed and swallowed up.</p>
<p>As the black flag swallowed up these black shadows, the aura it emitted became stronger and stronger while the darkness became deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>It seemed capable of swallowing everything in existence, even light.</p>
<p>The horrible suction force of the black flag obviously made the black shadows panic and soon they began to merge together, just like when Yang Kai and the others fled, in an attempt to fight off the black flag’s influence.</p>
<p>Seeing this scene, the Origin King wrapped in black Qi wasn’t afraid and instead became exhilarated, calling out, “You even have such a skill, good, good, good. This King’s Ten Thousand Soul Banner is going to have a feast today, kahahaha!”</p>
<p>As he laughed, he stretched out his hand and the black curtain twisted and condensed into a massive, terrifying human-shaped face. This face, however, had countless eyes and radiated an ominous and powerful light.</p>
<p>In addition, blood seemed to be overflowing from this face as he released violent and feral roars.</p>
<p>As the strange mouth opened, it continued to grow until it spread across and the entire face’s surface while at the same time, a vague human-shaped phantom appeared behind it.</p>
<p>The massive black shadow formed by the fusion of countless small shadows naturally didn’t sit there waiting to die and quickly lashed out with its two black whip-like hands in an attempt to block the advance of the Ten Thousand Soul Banner.</p>
<p>A huge cloud of dust and debris was kicked up from the intense shockwaves of the exchange, shaking the ravine and the surrounding earth.</p>
<p>However, it was all in vain.</p>
<p>The Ten Thousand Soul Banner did not fear the huge black shadow’s attacks at all and simply charged forward and bit down on it before raising its head up like a bird which had caught its prey and attempted to swallow it whole.</p>
<p>Vaguely, a scream came out from inside the face.</p>
<p>The terrifying face of the Ten Thousand Soul Banner flashed a look of satisfaction at that moment and its countless eyes shined with excitement.</p>
<p><em>Ge…</em></p>
<p>It even vividly belched.</p>
<p>The moment the huge black shadow was swallowed, the remaining fish that slipped through the net fled into the surrounding crevices, not daring to appear again. They seemed to have noticed that this Ten Thousand Soul Banner was their natural enemy, and they were unable to resist it!</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, the Origin King, who was still wrapped in black Qi, stretched out his hand somewhat unconsciously and summoned the Ten Thousand Soul Banner back to him.</p>
<p>On the surface, the Ten Thousand Soul Banner had not changed much compared to before, but the potency of the wicked aura it exuded was obviously greater.</p>
<p>“Heh heh heh…” The Origin King cackled lightly as he examined his artifact, nodding repeatedly, “Not bad, not bad. I just came in and already had such a harvest, worthy of the famed Severed World. This King is very much looking forward to what comes next!”</p>
<p>Clearly a bit disturbed in the mind, after talking to himself for some time, the Origin King put away his Ten Thousand Soul Banner and with a loud laugh wrapped his black Qi around himself tightly and rushed out of the ravine, chasing in the direction Yang Kai and his group had left.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Severed World, Sword Union’s Elder Cui Hong was desperately urging his artifact to fight off a Monster Beast that was nearly a hundred metres in length and resembled a winged snake.</p>
<p>His luck had been quite poor. Just after entering the Severed World, he had accidentally entered the territory of this Monster Beast, and when he was discovered, a fight broke out.</p>
<p>The greatest danger in the Severed World was the invisible Void Cracks scattered about irregularly and undetectable to both sight and Divine Sense. Even an Origin King Realm who touched such a Void Crack would not escape unharmed.</p>
<p>The second most dangerous thing, however, was the Monster Beasts that lived here.</p>
<p>The Monster Beasts here had almost all inherited the bloodlines of ancient variant species, and affected by the strong World Principles, they had all grown incredibly powerful. Even if similar Monster Beasts existed in the Star Field, the ones in the Severed World would generally be at least thirty percent stronger.</p>
<p>The one Cui Hong encountered was a genuine Tenth-Order Monster Beast, and from the looks of it, it had obviously inherited the bloodline of the Flying Feathered Python, but as time had passed and the World Principles had changed, this Monster Beast’s bloodline had diluted, and it was no longer able to display the full might of its glorious ancestors. If it had, Cui Hong would have died upon meeting it.</p>
<p>However, it was none-the-less a Tenth-Order Monster Beast, meaning it was equivalent to an Origin King in strength. A rare existence.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this Monster Beast did not seem to have broken through to its current level long ago, and as a Sword Union Elder, Cui Hong’s Artifact Armour and artifacts were all extremely high grade, so, he did not suffer much damage over the course of his battle and instead gained the upper hand by relying on various Secret Techniques.</p>
<p>This winged python was over a hundred metres in length, bat-like wings on its back and a long, sharp tongue in its mouth. It flew about in an extremely flexible manner, dodging around Cui Hong while ejecting its tongue like a steel whip from time to time, bombarding Cui Hong and causing him significant difficulties each time it landed a hit.</p>
<p>After a full three hours of fierce fighting, in exchange for taking a rather serious injury, Cui Hong managed to behead the winged python.</p>
<p>Standing in place, breathing heavily, his whole body stained red with blood, Cui Hong cursed angrily. After a short rest, he used what little strength he had left to collect the winged snake’s body into his Space Ring.</p>
<p>At this moment, he did not have the time to properly process the corpse and could only wait until after leaving the Severed World to deal with it slowly. The value of the corpse of a Tenth-Order Monster Beast was almost unimaginable, especially its Monster Core which had a huge attraction to Origin Kings.</p>
<p>When a cultivator reached the Origin King Realm, it became extremely difficult to break through because of the limitations placed on them by the Star Field’s Principles. If a cultivator wished to stride upwards, besides tortuous cultivation for an extended time while comprehending the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao, only rare treasures and powerful pills could enhance their strength.</p>
<p>An Origin King being unable to break through a single Minor Realm for centuries or even millennia was a very common occurrence.</p>
<p>Because of this, throughout the entire Star Field, Third-Order Origin Kings were extremely rare and almost all of them were old monsters who had long secluded themselves from the world…</p>
<p>After resting on the spot for a while, Cui Hong immediately left, afraid the smell of blood would attract other Monster Beasts. In his current state, he couldn’t fight another intense battle like just now.</p>
<p>In another place, Zi Long, the Sect Master of Purple Star, was bringing Zi Dong through the Severed World. He seemed to have a very clear goal and did not stop at any point along the way.</p>
<p>Their luck was also good, and they had not encountered any real danger since entering this place, so they proceeded with peace of mind.</p>
<p>“Father, does this Severed World really host an Immortal Tree?” Zi Dong, who was following Zi Long, suddenly asked.</p>
<p>Hearing the words ‘Immortal Tree’, Zi Long’s calm eyes suddenly burst with dazzling light and his long purple hair blew up even in the absence of wind. Nodding slightly, he replied, “Although your father cannot say for certain, the probability is at least eighty percent. After all, word of the Immoral Tree’s existence was sent back by your Grand Uncle. Two thousand years ago, your Grand Uncle once caught a glimpse of something very similar to the legendary Immoral Tree but when he attempted to obtain it, he was seriously injured by the Monster Beast that was guarding it and was forced to flee, ultimately dying from his wounds.”</p>
<p>Zi Dong’s face changed slightly as he whispered, “If I recall correctly, Grand Uncle was supposed to be a Second-Order Origin King, but he was still seriously injured by the guardian Monster Beast? What kind of Monster Beast was it?”</p>
<p>“A Divine Bird… an Ancient Peacock!” Zi Long took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“A Divine Bird!” Zi Dong couldn’t help paling slightly.</p>
<p>As long as a Monster Beast was classified as a Divine species, it was clear it was not to be provoked lightly. Every Divine beast had Heaven destroying and Earth-shattering means, as well as a vicious personality. If such a Monster Beast broke into the Star Field, it would likely destroy countless Cultivation Stars and become a disaster for the entire Star Field.</p>
<p>Zi Long then quickly followed up, “In the Star Field, the name ‘Three Great Divine Waters’ is widely known; one is Life Revitalizing Jade Cream, one is the Soul Cleansing Divine Water, and one is Immortal Source Liquid! Among these three, the Soul Cleansing Divine Water does occasionally appear, but not often, only once every few hundred or thousand years. As for the Life Revitalizing Jade Cream and Immortal Source Liquid, both are things of legend, lost to history, or at least your father here has never met anyone who succeeded in obtaining either of them. Each of the Three Great Divine Waters has its own unique effects which make them precious treasures that cultivators dream of. The Soul Cleansing Divine Water can wash the Soul, purifying and condensing one’s Spiritual Energy, the Life Revitalizing Jade Cream can enhance a cultivator’s physique and vitality, a single drop allowing a person to be reborn. However, neither of these two compare to the Immortal Source Liquid.”</p>
<p>“Father, does the Immortal Source Liquid have some kind of relation with the Immortal Tree?” Zi Dong asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Haha, naturally they are related,” Zi Long, as the master of one of the Star Field’s biggest forces, was normally a dignified man, but he became quite amiable when facing his son; after all, Zi Dong had never failed to live up to his expectations and was the successor he put his hopes on.</p>
<p>“Please enlighten me, Father!” Zi Dong put on a respectful look and showed an appearance of humility.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1760, Spirit Flower</h2>
<p>Zi Long pondered for a while before he continued, “En, the Immortal Source Liquid is the dew formed by the accumulation of essence over countless years on the leaves of the Immortal Tree. For the Immortal Source Liquid, regrowing lost limbs is simply a waste, it is a natural miracle elixir that can even bring people back to life!”</p>
<p>“Resurrecting the dead!?” Zi Dong looked shocked, “If just the trivial dew can have such a miraculous effect, then the Immortal Tree itself…”</p>
<p>“Hmph, if one can obtain the Immortal Tree and refine it, they can obtain an immortal and indestructible body, with longevity equal to the Heavens!”</p>
<p>“What?” Zi Dong was truly shocked when he heard this. Even as Purple Star’s Young Master, he could not help feeling astonished and would have dismissed it as nonsense if it weren’t his father who said it.</p>
<p>“If I can have an endless lifespan, your father will be able to achieve something no one has before. When that time comes, I will surpass the Origin King Realm and get a glimpse of the mysteries of the Great Emperor’s realm!” When Zi Long said this, his entire figure seemed to radiate excitement and fanaticism.</p>
<p>Zi Dong stared at his father in a daze, not having seen such an expression on his face for many, many years. One could only imagine how powerful the Immortal Tree’s temptation was to his father.</p>
<p>“Father, does only our Purple Star know about this?” Zi Dong asked again.</p>
<p>“No!” Zi Long shook his head, a look of frustration appearing on his face, “I’m not certain about others, but Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce must know about the existence of the Immortal Tree, because two thousand years ago, you Grand Uncle came here with the previous President of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce. That’s why that old fart Ni Guang came this time. He must be aiming for the Immortal Tree as well.”</p>
<p>Zi Dong frowned and asked suspiciously, “If that’s the case, why didn’t father bring more masters along?”</p>
<p>Zi Long smiled lightly, “This kind of information can’t be known by too many people; after all, there is only one Immortal Tree. Even if gathering more people leads to successfully obtaining it, who will claim ownership in the end? In front of such a supreme treasure, one can only believe in themselves, all others…. are enemies.”</p>
<p>Zi Dong pondered thoughtfully before nodding, “This child understands.”</p>
<p>“En, you are still young and the road ahead of you is still long. Father’s purpose in bringing you here this time was to hone your will and expose you to some true dangers, which will be of great benefit to your future growth. I hope you don’t disappoint me.”</p>
<p>“This child will do his best!” Zi Dong quickly declared.</p>
<p>As the Sect Master of Purple Star, Zi Long had countless children, but Zi Dong was the one he liked the most. Among his countless children, only Zi Dong stood out and was thus the only one who received his nurturing.</p>
<p>Zi Dong also understood this well, so he had not dared to slack on his cultivation all these years.</p>
<p>Entering the Severed World this time was truly dangerous, but it was also a good test. As long as he passed this test, his position in Purple Star would become unshakable.</p>
<p>Zi Dong came to clench his fist secretly as he swore to perform well this time.</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>At the same time, somewhere far away, Yang Kai and a group of four headed by Ni Guang were advancing through the Severed World.</p>
<p>They did not encounter much danger on their journey, but also did not gain many benefits, making the Severed World seem to not live up its reputation.</p>
<p>However, Ni Guang had taken out something that caught Yang Kai’s eye.</p>
<p>It was an artifact that resembled a communication artifact but was somewhat different because it had a pointer on it. Ni Guang had taken it out two hours ago and had yet to put it away, moving it from side to side as they travelled.</p>
<p>As he moved it around, the pointer would occasionally undergo some subtle changes, and each time it did, Ni Guang would slightly change direction.</p>
<p>Luo Lan was confused and wondered what kind of magical effect this artifact had, secretly guessing that Ni Guang was somehow using it to avoid dangers, but since this was related to another’s methods, she knew better than to ask and had to keep her curiosity to herself.</p>
<p>Yang Kai, on the other hand, was surprised because he noticed that this artifact was able to detect the location of some hidden Void Cracks.</p>
<p>Whenever the pointer on the artifact pointed towards a certain spot, Yang Kai would be able to sense some obscure Space Force fluctuations from that direction and Ni Guang would always avoid it in advance.</p>
<p>This was obviously a special artifact that was refined to cope with the Severed World’s environment, and whoever refined it had most likely also cultivated the Dao of Space!</p>
<p>Yang Kai was certain of his guess; after all, Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce was a massive super force so the number of talented people it possessed was immense. It was only natural to assume that some of these talents had cultivated Space Force.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai also inferred from the sensitivity of this artifact that the person who refined it was far less accomplished in the Dao of Space than he was.</p>
<p>Because this artifact was not able to detect all the hidden Void Cracks in their surrounding!</p>
<p>There were some Void Cracks that the group passed within a few dozen metres, which Yang Kai was able to perceive clearly. Obviously, the artifact had given no response to these Void Cracks. When such occurrences happened, Yang Kai was put on the edge, for fear that Ni Guang would inadvertently run into one.</p>
<p>Fortunately, nothing of the sort happened along the way so there was no need for Yang Kai to reveal his secrets to warn Ni Guang to change their route.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there would be traces of tears in the air that were clearly Void Cracks which were visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>These tears were like rips in the sky, permanent features, adding to the dangerous atmosphere of the Severed World.</p>
<p>And as the group forward, whether it was the visible Void Cracks or the ones that were hidden, their number was clearly increasing.</p>
<p>Yang Kai and the others even saw a few massive, sky crossing cracks that gave off terrifying fluctuations, making it impossible to determine what lay beyond it.</p>
<p>When he saw such Void Cracks, Yang Kai became quite eager to explore.</p>
<p>He clearly felt that this huge Void Crack very possibly had what he needed: Space Spirit Crystals bred from The Void itself. It also seemed to contain the insights he longed for regarding the Dao of Space. Either way, Yang Kai felt strongly that if he were to rush into it, he would definitely gain greatly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was currently acting together with Ni Guang and the others, so he did not dare leave the team rashly. He could only pass by this Void Crack for now. In any case, in the Severed World, there were many opportunities like this, so he was not in a hurry.</p>
<p>“Hm…” Ni Guang, who was leading the way, suddenly stopped, turned his head to look in a certain direction, and called out in surprise.</p>
<p>Following his line of sight, the other three in the group soon saw a person lying on the ground about a thousand metres away.</p>
<p>“That’s…” Luo Lan whispered, “His clothes seem familiar, was it someone who came in with us before?”</p>
<p>“It seems so,” Ni Guang said solemnly, scanning the figure with his Divine Sense carefully before his face slightly changed. “But it seems he’s already dead.”</p>
<p>Luo Lan’s pretty face went pale hearing this. Among the cultivators who entered the Severed World before, besides Yang Kai, Xue Yue, and Zi Dong, the rest were all Origin Kings, none of them weaker than herself.</p>
<p>However, after just a few hours, they came across a dead body here.</p>
<p>It was hard to imagine what kind of attack this man suffered. With his powerful Origin King cultivation, he died here, and there were also no signs of struggle in the surroundings, as if there hadn’t been a fight at all. In order words, this man had been attacked by something so powerful that he had died without being able to resist.</p>
<p>If it had been her instead, Luo Lan imagined that her fate might not have been any better.</p>
<p>She began to rejoice that her luck had been so good.</p>
<p>“Should we investigate?” Xue Yue pondered for a moment before pointing in the direction of the corpse, “There seems to be something next to his body.”</p>
<p>Even without her reminder, everyone had noticed that there was indeed something besides the body of this fallen Origin King. It was a small cockscomb-like flower that was growing straight up from the ground, and even from a thousand metres away, everyone could smell its fragrant scent.</p>
<p>This aura was calming and refreshing, causing everyone’s tight nerves to relax slightly.</p>
<p>“What kind of spirit herb is that? Do any of you know?” Ni Guang turned his head and asked.</p>
<p>Luo Lan shook her head wryly while Xue Yue also indicated she did not know. In fact, even Yang Kai, who was an Origin King Grade Alchemist, was ignorant.</p>
<p>He had never seen this kind of spirit flower before. He had obtained the True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture from the Emperor Garden, which not only recorded countless lost pill recipes, but also details about innumerable exotic flowers and plants. It was almost a comprehensive record of all herbs in existence, so in terms of pure knowledge, Yang Kai was confident no one in the Star Field was better than him.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai had not seen anything like this flower in the many records of the True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture.</p>
<p>Ni Guang frowned and after hesitating for a moment said, “I’ll go take a look, all of you stand here and don’t move.”</p>
<p>Confident in his great strength, he did not want to give up the opportunity in front of him, and regardless of what spirit flower this was, just the corpse of the Origin King next to it was a treasure trove. If he could obtain the other party’s Space Ring, it would be a good harvest.</p>
<p>“Do you want this Mistress to accompany you?” Luo Lan asked.</p>
<p>Ni Guang glanced at her and nodded, “Then, you should be careful.”</p>
<p>“This Mistress certainly will be,” Luo Lan responded with a smile before slowly approaching the spirit flower together with Ni Guang.</p>
<p>Yang Kai and Xue Yue stood back, paying attention to the movement ahead.</p>
<p>The two crossed the thousand-metre distance quickly, but to everyone’s surprise, even after Ni Guang and Luo Lan arrived next to the corpse, there were no signs of danger.</p>
<p>Ni Guang looked puzzled and scanned the corpse below him, soon whispering solemnly, “This person was attacked from behind by something and killed instantly. There are two bite marks on the back of his neck, similar to those of some snake-type Monster Beast, a venomous one at that!”</p>
<p>Luo Lan nodded as she also noticed this, because this corpse was lying face down and the back of his neck was clearly exposed.</p>
<p>It was conceivable that this person had been bitten in the back of the neck by something unsuspectingly, then fell to the ground, dying immediately, resulting in this kind of defenceless posture.</p>
<p>Obviously, the venom which entered him from his neck was something even an Origin King couldn’t resist.</p>
<p>“Elder Luo, please take this corpse with you, I’ll pick the spirit flower,” Ni Guang ordered.</p>
<p>“Understood,” Luo Lan nodded before proceeding with caution. Instead of touching the corpse with her hands directly, she used her Saint Qi to wrap it up before quickly retreating backwards.</p>
