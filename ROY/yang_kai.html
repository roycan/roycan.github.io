<h2>Chapter 1589, Good Methods</h2>
<p>The red-haired old man coldly snorted and said with a displeased expression, “A trivial human really isn’t worth making a fuss over, but Chi Yue, aren’t you making a mistake here? We’ve gathered here to deliver our Monster Race’s young talents to the Blood Prison. Is him being here because he’s going to enter the Blood Prison as well?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” Chi Yue gently nodded.</p>
<p>The red-haired old man’s face sank as a look of anger flashed across his eyes while the burly man coldly and sternly asked, “Why haven’t Brother Kuang Shi and I heard about this before?”</p>
<p>“For such a small matter, this Queen thought it wasn’t necessary to inform anyone, so she didn’t,” Chi Yue said casually before putting on a disgruntled look, “This boy and my Qing Luo are old acquaintances, they are simply using this Queen’s Space Array to go to Green Mountains Star, you two don’t need to interfere!”</p>
<p>The burly man frowned and stared at Chi Yue deeply before asking in a low tone, “Chi Yue, what are you plotting?”</p>
<p>“Since when was this Queen plotting anything? Can’t the two of you see that this boy is only a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm brat? This boy is so arrogant and overconfident that he wants to rely on his old friendship with my Qing Luo to try to taste swan meat as a mere toad. This Queen spared his life and agreed to allow him to pursue Qing Luo if he can live through the Blood Prison Trial. Since he wants to die, this Queen won’t try to stop him. I’m sure this is enough of an explanation to satisfy the two of you.”</p>
<p>The red-haired old man and the burly man exchanged a glance, neither of them daring to believe all of Chi Yue’s words, but also feeling like pressing the matter further was inappropriate.</p>
<p>The Space Array leading to the Blood Prison was created by a previous Red Moon Tribal Lord ten thousand years ago and belonged exclusively to Red Moon Territory, so only Chi Yue could open it to allow the rising stars from the other territories through.</p>
<p>Chi Yue had complete control over this Space Array!</p>
<p>If they became stubborn here, the gains wouldn’t be worth the loss. If Chi Yue became angry and refused to allow their descendants and disciples to use this Space Array next time, they wouldn’t be able to enter the Blood Prison Trial.</p>
<p>“This brat is certainly crazy enough!” The red-haired old man looked at Yang Kai disdainfully, “Such shameless boasting! Since he wants to die, naturally this old master has no objections, but Chi Yue, next time, if something like this is to happen again, please inform this old master in advance!”</p>
<p>“Indeed!” The burly man nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Chi Yue smiled winningly and said, “This Queen acted somewhat rashly this time. Fine, this Queen promises that there won’t be a second instance.”</p>
<p>With Chi Yue saying these words, the red-haired old man and the brawny man couldn’t say anymore, they could only open one eye while closing the other, pretending they saw nothing.</p>
<p>“Qing Luo, come greet Senior Kuang Shi and Senior Nu Xie, these two are prestigious figures on my Monster Emperor Star,” Chi Yue beckoned to Shan Qing Luo.</p>
<p>Shan Qing Luo responded immediately and swiftly stepped forward to offer her greetings.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression moved slightly as he immediately understood that these two Origin King Realm masters should be the Wild Lion Tribal Lord and Fierce Crab Tribal Lord, but he was still confused as to why they had appeared here.</p>
<p>Just as he was contemplating this, however, Yang Kai suddenly felt a hate-filled glare coming from nearby. When he turned to take a look at the source of this glare, Yang Kai saw Xue Lian staring at him. Yang Kai simply grinned at this sight, causing Xue Lian’s face to twitch, as if he was recalling the fight he had with Yang Kai the other day, bringing unpleasant memories up in his mind.</p>
<p>In that battle, his pride had been completely shredded.</p>
<p>“Yang Kai, over here!” Ba He greeted him enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded lightly and walked over to the chair beside him and sat down.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Ba He had come to Little Senior Sister’s palace to request Alchemy and left happily. The herbs he had worked hard to gather had not gone to waste and were successfully refined by Xia Ning Chang’s masterful hands.</p>
<p>As such, Ba He was very grateful to Xia Ning Chang and behaved even friendlier with Yang Kai in turn.</p>
<p>“Yang Kai, you must be careful during this trip to the Blood Prison. Everyone there will be a Minor Realm higher than you in cultivation. Don’t become overconfident,” Ba He whispered.</p>
<p>“Junior has always been very low-key,” Yang Kai chuckled.</p>
<p>Ba He couldn’t help rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>“By the way, Senior, who are those two?” Yang Kai cast his eyes towards a pair of Monster Race rising stars he had never met before and asked.</p>
<p>Ba He naturally wouldn’t conceal something so simple so he immediately introduced these two in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>One of the two was a well-endowed woman named Xue Sun who hailed from Fierce Crab Territory and was the most powerful subordinate of Fierce Crab Tribal Lord. The other was a sunny-looking young man named Lie Feng who came from Wild Lion Territory and was similarly one of Wild Lion Tribal Lord’s best subordinates.</p>
<p>Fierce Crab Tribal Lord and Wild Lion Tribal Lord apparently didn’t have satisfactory heirs, so they could only send their best subordinates to participate in the Blood Prison Trial. Of course, both Xue Sun and Lie Feng were talents in their respective territories.</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently nodded and kept them in mind.</p>
<p>The two Monster Race masters also seemed to be very interested in Yang Kai, glancing over at him from time to time with Lie Feng even sending Yang Kai a friendly smile.</p>
<p>[This guy should not be difficult to get along with!] Yang Kai secretly mused.</p>
<p>The hall remained relatively silent as time passed by. Everyone had their eyes closed and seemed to be in a meditative state.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s Divine Sense constantly probed the Ultra-Long Distance Space Array in the main hall, prying into its hidden subtleties. After some time, he discovered that the layout of this array was actually quite similar to the one which connected Monster Emperor Star and the Spider Mother’s Den, making him wonder if they had some kind of connection.</p>
<p>One day later, Chi Yue and the other Tribal Lords suddenly opened their eyes together and energy pulsed from their forms.</p>
<p>“It’s time!” Wild Lion Tribal Lord gave a low shout.</p>
<p>The eight Origin Returning Realm masters who were waiting to depart all stood up together.</p>
<p>Without seeing how they acted, the three Monster Race Tribal Lords all suddenly arrived at the edge of the Ultra-Long Distance Space Array and stood in a triangular pattern with solemn expressions.</p>
<p>“Begin!” Chi Yue yelled softly as she suddenly formed a complicated series of signs with her hands.</p>
<p>The same was true for Nu Xie and Kuang Shi. As these three Monster Race Tribal lords continued their actions, shocking and powerful waves of energy began condensing around their bodies.</p>
<p>The Origin Returning Realm cultivators in the hall all stared at this dazzling display while secretly dreaming about when they would be able to reach such a phenomenon height.</p>
<p>Chi Yue, Nu Xie, and Kuang Shi’s Saint Qi surged suddenly as they began pouring it madly into the Space Array, seeming going all out.</p>
<p>The array buzzed and the Saint Crystals set in it long ago burst into radiant light, filling the hall with a brightness not inferior to the mid-day sun, blinding everyone in the hall.</p>
<p>“All of you, Green Mountains Star is far from Monster Emperor Star, and although this Ultra-Long Distance Space Array can guarantee that you arrive safely inside the Blood Prison, it cannot guarantee where you will appear, so you must exercise extreme caution,” Chi Yue’s voice rang out, “All those who can enter the Blood Prison are masters with high strength. In there, try to avoid conflicts, your main objective is to comprehend the mysteries of Domain and obtain Domain Stones. This Queen hopes that all of you leaving today will arrive back together!”</p>
<p>“Is that clear?” Kuang Shi couldn’t help roaring when the crowd didn’t react much.</p>
<p>“Yes!” The Monster Race Juniors replied in unison.</p>
<p>Kuang Shi finally showed a satisfied look.</p>
<p>“This King doesn’t have any more advice for you,” Nu Xie chuckled, concisely stating, “As long as you return alive, Monster Emperor Star will have a place for you in the future!”</p>
<p>“We will obey three Seniors’ teachings!”</p>
<p>At this moment, the entire palace seemed to tremble and the Ultra-Long Distance Space Array released a terrifying roar as a white beam of light shot out from it into the sky.</p>
<p>Even from thousands of kilometres away, one could clearly see this white beam of light.</p>
<p>The trembling gradually subsided and the white light beam gradually disappeared before finally, atop the Ultra-Long Distance Space Array, an oval-shaped gateway comprised of pure energy appeared in front of everyone’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Go!” Chi Yue solemnly shouted.</p>
<p>Ba He took the lead, nodding to Chi Yue lightly before rushing into the gate without a single glance backwards, disappearing in a flash.</p>
<p>One figure after another followed Ba He through the light gate.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t bother fighting with the others, simply waiting until there was no one left. When he stepped onto the Space Array and was about to disappear, however, he suddenly grinned towards Chi Yue and waved his hand, “Senior Chi Yue, if there’s a chance, let us meet again!”</p>
<p>Chi Yue’s pretty face sank and her brow furrowed when she heard this.</p>
<p>But without waiting for her to ask anything, Yang Kai also disappeared.</p>
<p>“This human boy is really rampant!” Kuang Shi coldly snorted.</p>
<p>“Close the gateway first,” Nu Xie hurriedly said, “We need to avoid causing too much of a disturbance lest that old dog from Green Mountains Star notices something.”</p>
<p>Chi Yue did not respond, however, her expression suddenly changing. As if she had realized something, she released her Divine Sense like a flood towards the palace where Xia Ning Chang had been staying.</p>
<p>The next moment, Chi Yue’s pretty face twisted as she ground her teeth and muttered under her breath, “Little bastard, you dare play tricks with this Queen!”</p>
<p>When she realized that Xia Ning Chang was not in the palace, Chi Yue immediately understood what Yang Kai had been plotting.</p>
<p>He never planned to return to Monster Emperor Star because there was no need for him to do so!</p>
<p>Chi Yue had thought that by retaining Grandmaster Xia, she could manipulate this little human brat at will, but it turned out the other side was one step ahead of her.</p>
<p>However, no matter how she thought about it, Chi Yue couldn’t figure out how Yang Kai made Xia Ning Chang disappear or where he had hidden her.</p>
<p>Obviously, that woman surnamed Xia was still in the palace a day ago, so how had she suddenly disappeared?</p>
<p>“Chi Yue, what are you doing?” Nu Xie and Kuang Shi both looked at her with puzzled faces, not understanding why she suddenly became so angry.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” Chi Yue shook her head and took a deep breath, “Close the gateway first.”</p>
<p>Being outwitted by a mere human brat at the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm was not something Chi Yue would advertise. If she really told them, the only result would be Nu Xie and Kuang Shi laughing at her in derision.</p>
<p>She would not admit such a shameful truth.</p>
<p>[But this little brat really had some good methods; no wonder he wanted me to hand over the second half of the Monster Transformation Secret Art to Yu Xiong for safekeeping.]</p>
<p>What about Qing Luo though? Would she leave with him? Thinking so, Chi Yue’s thoughts became somewhat distressed and her expression turned ugly.</p>
<p>Even if she was tricked by Yang Kai, as long as he obtained that Origin Essence Crystal and exchanged it with Yu Xiong, she wouldn’t lose anything, but if that little bastard managed to lure Qing Luo with some sweet nothings, how would she find them in this vast Star Field?</p>
<p>[If you dare do so, even if this Queen needs to search until the end of time, she will take your head!] Chi Yue secretly decided.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1590, Blood Prison</h2>
<p>A feeling of vertigo, as if space had been distorted and collapsed in on itself, overcame Yang Kai.</p>
<p>This was a clear sign of tearing space!</p>
<p>For Yang Kai, short-distance jumps did not affect him, but this kind of ultra-long-distance transmission from one Cultivation Star to another Cultivation Star was still a burden to him.</p>
<p>Fortunately, with his proficiency in the Dao of Space, he was able to dispel most of these negative effects after circulating his Saint Qi slightly.</p>
<p>After the flash of light around him faded, Yang Kai found himself in a strange land.</p>
<p>Before he had time to look around, he noticed that there was a life of aura not far away.</p>
<p>Turning his head vigilantly, Yang Kai found that the man was actually Lie Feng of Wild Lion Territory, who had appeared about a thousand metres away from him.</p>
<p>The other party had entered the Space Array before him, but was clearly in worse shape, seemingly still trying to stabilize himself after the transmission.</p>
<p>Lie Feng did not cultivate the Dao of Space like Yang Kai did, so the negative side-effects of this kind of long-range teleportation naturally took longer to recover from. However, Lie Feng was a rising star of the Monster Race with a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation, so after about three breaths, he opened his eyes having fully recovered. Like Yang Kai, he vigilantly began scanning his surroundings while silently condensing his Saint Qi in preparation to deal with any crises that might arise.</p>
<p>In the next moment, he saw Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Oh…” Lie Feng showed a look of surprise and stood in place for a moment before walking over to Yang Kai with a smile on his face and asking, “I heard your name is Yang Kai, yes?”</p>
<p>“En.” Yang Kai nodded lightly, his attitude neither warm nor cold.</p>
<p>“I also heard that you taught Xue Lian a harsh lesson?” Lie Feng seemed very interested in him.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t answer.</p>
<p>Lie Feng simply shrugged, “I heard from Yu Xiong. It is a pity that I hadn’t arrived earlier in Red Moon Territory, otherwise I would have been able to watch such a lively event. Heh heh, to tell you the truth, I’ve never liked Xue Lian either. However, it’s really surprising that you were able to beat Xue Lian. Seems the Human Race cannot be underestimated. En, I’d like to offer you an invitation.”</p>
<p>“An invitation to do what?” Yang Kai looked at him curiously.</p>
<p>The other had a friendly attitude from start to finish, so Yang Kai’s impression of him wasn’t bad.</p>
<p>“To act together,” Lie Feng smiled, “Brother Yang, as you know, this is Green Mountains Star. We Monster Race cultivators snuck in here and obviously won’t receive any good treatment, and from the looks of it, it seems that only you and I appeared in this area. If Brother Yang and I can join forces, our security will definitely increase a lot.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, but I’m not interested!” Yang Kai shook his head and refused.</p>
<p>“Why?” Lie Feng frowned.</p>
<p>“Because I’m human! I won’t be discriminated against here,” Yang Kai pointed to himself, then pointed to Lie Feng and said, “You belong to the Monster Race, so what do you think would happen if someone who hates the Monster Race saw me with you? Would they also attack me? I don’t want to ask for extra trouble.”</p>
<p>“Uh…” Lie Feng was stunned, then scratched his head and said, “That’s reasonable. Since Brother Yang thinks so, then forget it, this Lie hadn’t considered the situation completely.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll simply wish Brother Yang good luck and head off first!” Lie Feng didn’t look irritated because Yang Kai refused his invitation, instead just laughing heartily before picking a direction at will and flying off.</p>
<p>He was very straightforward.</p>
<p>After he left, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to scan his surroundings more carefully.</p>
<p>A moment later, his face changed slightly and he quickly took back his Divine Sense.</p>
<p>What Shan Qing Luo had told him wasn’t wrong. Inside the Blood Prison, it wasn’t a good idea to casually release one’s Divine Sense.</p>
<p>Although there were no restrictions or suppression of Divine Sense in this place, there were countless Domain Vortices all across this ancient battlefield.</p>
<p>These Domain Vortices were all remnants from the great battle between Origin King Realm masters over ten thousand years ago. Some had dissipated while others had undergone strange transformations and become more terrifying over time.</p>
<p>These Domain Vortices were capable of swallowing anything, including Divine Sense!</p>
<p>Yang Kai had suffered a small loss just now, and if he hadn’t withdrawn his Divine Sense in time, it was likely he would have suffered severe damage to his Soul. Even so, there was a stinging pain in his head at this moment, like a needle pricking his brain.</p>
<p>This was a sign that his Divine Sense had taken damage, but with the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus nourishing his Soul, Yang Kai didn’t need to care too much about this damage.</p>
<p>“It looks like this really is the Blood Prison,” Yang Kai looked around and muttered to himself.</p>
<p>Only in the Blood Prison would such strange Domain Vortices exist.</p>
<p>The former Red Moon Tribal Lord was indeed a Heaven sent genius, able to create an Ultra-Long Distance Space Array that connected to the Blood Prison from Monster Emperor Star.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because the distance was too far, it was unable to select a precise destination. Yang Kai only discovered Lie Feng nearby while the other Monster Race rising stars had clearly been sent somewhere else.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was fairly confident in Shan Qing Luo’s strength as she had inherited the power of a Heavenly Moon Demon Spider’s Source, making her more than a match for ordinary cultivators in the same realm as her.</p>
<p>Coupled with the Thunder Fire Seven Birds Whip that he had given her, Shan Qing Luo’s current combat strength was truly impressive.</p>
<p>The only troublesome thing was her enchanting appearance, which was likely to become the main reason for others to target her.</p>
<p>[No man is capable of resisting her charms…]</p>
<p>After thinking about it for a while though, Yang Kai just shook his head slowly and set the matter aside.</p>
<p>[Qing Luo has her own path to follow.] Yang Kai felt that it was impossible for him to take care of her all the time; what’s more, they had been separated for dozens of years yet she was still alive and well, so Yang Kai believed she wouldn’t have a problem moving forward smoothly in the future.</p>
<p>Randomly picking a direction, Yang Kai slowly flew off.</p>
<p>He didn’t dare to move too quickly. He had only heard about the dangers of the Blood Prison and never personally experienced them, but this place being the burial ground for innumerable Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters was a fact.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was confident he was invincible beneath the Origin King Realm, but he still needed to act cautiously when facing the power of an Origin King’s Domain. He didn’t want to die here from acting recklessly.</p>
<p>There were no major incidents along Yang Kai’s way as he moved forward, but a few of the Domain Vortices which were scattered about did draw Yang Kai’s interest.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these Domain Vortices weren’t too strong and the mysteries they hid were quite vague, so even though Yang Kai tried to penetrate them with his Divine Sense and spent a fair amount of time trying to comprehend something from them, his gains were very limited and he was forced to give up.</p>
<p>He didn’t relax his vigilance as he knew there was murderous intent hidden everywhere in this place. He definitely couldn’t underestimate the Blood Prison simply because the first Domain Vortices he came across were small and weak.</p>
<p>Along the way, he also felt several life auras and even saw another Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation pass by a few thousand metres away from him.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Blood Prison had only just opened and no one was willing to stir up trouble yet. Everyone was still doing their best to avoid conflict while searching for opportunities; therefore, as soon as the unknown cultivator noticed Yang Kai, they changed direction to avoid him.</p>
<p>One day later, Yang Kai stood solemnly at a certain spot while staring straight ahead at a place a thousand metres away.</p>
<p>In that direction was a middle-aged man in blue robes covered in blood. Bursts of Saint Qi flickered from this man’s body and it seemed his situation was quite distressed. Outside his body was a defensive artifact that resembled a water curtain which was shielding him.</p>
<p>This man was constantly releasing his Shi and using various Secret Techniques in an attempt to escape from the place he was trapped.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his efforts failed to yield any noticeable results. The space around him seemed calm, but also somewhat solidified, confining him in place and making it impossible for him to move forward or backwards at all.</p>
<p>All around this middle-aged man were flowing streaks of light, like sharp swords, cutting into his defensive artifact and draining its power.</p>
<p>This man had accidentally rushed into a Domain Vortex!</p>
<p>What’s more, this was a very powerful Domain Vortex that could easily imprison a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master.</p>
<p>This man’s expression was ugly to the extreme and, as he felt the grip of death closing in around him, he only urged his Saint Qi harder and harder.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he saw Yang Kai who was staring at him from nearby, and his eyes lit up, as if he had caught a life-saving straw. Shouting loudly, “Friend, please help! I was accidentally caught in this Domain Vortex and am unable to escape, please show mercy and lend me your aid!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned and did not respond.</p>
<p>Although he wasn’t afraid of this middle-aged man, the Domain Vortex that was currently trapping this man caused Yang Kai some anxiety. For a stranger, Yang Kai naturally wouldn’t put himself in danger.</p>
<p>The reason Yang Kai even remained here was to comprehend the mysteries of this Domain Vortex.</p>
<p>Seeing that Yang Kai was not replying, the middle-aged man couldn’t help growing anxious, thinking that the other party was cold-blooded and refused to save him. Hurriedly, he shouted once more, “Friend, this one is Scarlet Wave Star Blue Feather Sect’s Sect Master Xu Ding Yang. Please assist me. If you can save me, this Xu will surely offer generous thanks and Blue Feather Sect will also be eternally grateful.”</p>
<p>“Scarlet Wave Star?” Yang Kai brow rose slightly, thinking he had heard this name before but was unable to put his finger on it at the moment. However, he still slowly shook his head, “Friend, it’s not that I don’t want to save you, but the power of this Domain Vortex is a bit too daunting.”</p>
<p>Xu Ding Yang’s complexion darkened. Although he showed an unwilling look, he knew that Yang Kai was telling the truth.</p>
<p>For a while, he fell speechless.</p>
<p>“Hold on, let me see if I can find a solution,” Yang Kai said lightly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai wasn’t acting out of kindness here. He knew nothing about this Xu Ding Yang’s true temperament, but even if he was really a righteous soul, he must have been mentally prepared to fall since he had entered the Blood Prison.</p>
<p>This Xu Ding Yang couldn’t blame anyone if he died here.</p>
<p>Yang Kai only offered to help because he wanted to enter the Domain Vortex to study it.</p>
<p>He wanted to learn more about the unique power of Origin Kings, Domain.</p>
<p>Xu Ding Yang obviously misunderstood Yang Kai’s intentions though and was immediately overjoyed, “Please allow this Xu to offer his thanks in advance! Friend, please be careful, this vortex seems to be a fusion of many different Domains which is why it is so difficult to deal with!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai just nodded lightly and took a step forward.</p>
<p>In an instant, Yang Kai’s face paled. At this moment, he felt that the surrounding space seemed to freeze and that many powerful, contradictory forces were overlapping here, causing him to push his Saint Qi unconsciously to resist.</p>
<p>With a ripping sound, several noticeable cuts appeared on Yang Kai’s clothes. The invisible Domain here seemed capable of killing any creature that dared to enter it, with even a single step creating an enormous difference in intensity.</p>
<p>Not daring to hesitate, Yang Kai hurriedly resisted this force and summoned his Purple Shield at the same time, transforming it into a light curtain which enveloped his body.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1591, Comprehending</h2>
<p>In an instant, the sound of scraping metal rang out from the Purple Shield as a terrifying invisible force constantly grated against Yang Kai’s defensive artifact.</p>
<p>The purple light curtain covering his body faded at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face sank seeing this and he quickly took back his Purple Shield.</p>
<p>Although this defensive artifact was Origin Grade High-Rank and was incredibly strong, it wasn’t sufficient to compete with the Domain here. If this Domain were allowed to destroy the light curtain, the Purple Shield’s spirituality would suffer a massive loss.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was forced to push his Saint Qi with all his strength to resist the invisible and terrifying pressure around him as he was stuck in place struggling against the tide.</p>
<p>“Only Second-Order Origin Realm…” Xu Ding Yang stared dumbfounded at Yang Kai, a look of astonishment on his face.</p>
<p>As soon as Yang Kai pushed his Saint Qi, Xu Ding Yang naturally perceived Yang Kai’s true cultivation and was inevitably disappointed.</p>
<p>Although the Second and Third-Order were only one Minor Realm apart, the gap in strength between the two was immense. Moreover, this was the Blood Prison, where normally only Third-Order Origin Realm cultivators entered to seek opportunities.</p>
<p>Xu Ding Yang felt that with Yang Kai’s strength, forget about saving him, even preserving his own life would be impossible.</p>
<p>“Friend, forgive me!” Xu Ding Yang worked hard to resist while kindly warning Yang Kai, “This Xu didn’t know you were only a Second-Order Origin Realm cultivator, otherwise he wouldn’t have asked for help. Friend has not yet entered too far, so you should hurry up and withdraw before it’s too late and you no longer can.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai ignored him however and simply continued to strengthen the output of his Saint Qi, probing the mysteries of the Domain Vortex.</p>
<p>What shocked Yang Kai, however, was that this Domain Vortex seemed completely unaffected by his efforts. No matter how hard Yang Kai tried, the suppression he felt remained the same, making it difficult to even move a single step.</p>
<p>Several strange and mysterious powers wrapped around his body, making it impossible for Yang Kai to comprehend anything.</p>
<p>[So this is the power of Domain! Worthy of the unique power possessed by Origin King Realm masters.]</p>
<p>“Friend, use your Shi to resist it, you can’t rely on brute force to deal with Domain, otherwise you’ll only get pulled deeper and deeper into it!” Seeing Yang Kai’s difficult situation, Xu Ding Yang quickly warned.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression changed and he quickly released his Shi as suggested.</p>
<p>In an instant, he noticed that the solidified space around him seemed to loosen somewhat as his Shi cut into the Domain Vortex like an invisible blade, allowing him to resist its influence.</p>
<p>“Many thanks for the advice!” Yang Kai raised his head, glanced over at Xu Ding Yang, and said his thanks.</p>
<p>“A minor matter!” Xu Ding Yang squeezed out an ugly smile as sweat dripped from his forehead and the Saint Qi glow around his body faded even more rapidly.</p>
<p>After talking to Yang Kai for a moment, Xu Ding Yang’s situation became even more unbearable and he immediately focused all of his attention on resisting the terrifying pressure of the Domain Vortex.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s demeanor also became solemn as he tried his best to expand his Shi.</p>
<p>With him as the centre, a circle with a ten metre radius began to form where space slowly distorted and faint, almost invisible Void Cracks appeared and disappeared.</p>
<p>Once this zone was established, the pressure Yang Kai felt suddenly eased greatly.</p>
<p>The Domain of an Origin King Realm master was an evolved form of Shi, a mysterious power a level higher than Shi.</p>
<p>As such, using Shi to resist Domain was naturally effective.</p>
<p>If this Domain was being displayed by a living Origin King Realm master, Yang Kai’s Shi wouldn’t be able to put up any resistance even if he had cultivated it to the grand accomplishment stage, but this Domain Vortex was simply a remnant from over ten thousand years ago, so even if it had strengthened and condensed over a long span of time, it wasn’t nearly as dangerous without anyone controlling it.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was barely able to deal with it.</p>
<p>It was no wonder so many Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters flocked to the Blood Prison despite it being extremely dangerous, the benefits here were simply that attractive to Third-Order masters.</p>
<p>The Domain Vortices that existed here were simply the best auxiliary aide for Third-Order Origin Realm masters to condense their Shi.</p>
<p>A cultivator could condense their Shi here, enhancing their control over it, while at the same time comprehend the mysteries of Domain, so once they cultivated their Shi to the grand accomplishment stage, they would have the capital necessary to attempt a breakthrough to the Origin King Realm!</p>
<p>This was a height that most Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters would never be able to reach.</p>
<p>Yang Kai wholeheartedly used his Shi to resist the surrounding invisible Domain while some faint, stray thoughts inexplicably poured into his mind. Sometimes he frowned and thought while sometimes his face was filled with joy, his expression constantly changing.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, he began stepping forward, and although his speed was extremely slow, Yang Kai was undoubtedly moving towards the centre of Domain Vortex, seeking more powerful mysteries of Domain.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s control over his Shi also became more flexible and the original ten metre radius around himself began to expand at a subtle speed. Although this change wasn’t conspicuous, it was definite and steady.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was completely immersed in his comprehension, unable to extricate himself.</p>
<p>The man named Xu Ding Yang was in a dire situation, but he still made some time to observe Yang Kai’s movements.</p>
<p>When he saw Yang Kai walking towards him step by step, resisting the terrifying Domain power with only a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation, Xu Ding Yang was completely shocked.</p>
<p>He knew better than anyone the intensity of this Domain Vortex and had figured that, with Yang Kai weak cultivation, he would definitely be forced to withdraw immediately, otherwise he would undoubtedly die.</p>
<p>However, this young man who he had never met before not only didn’t withdraw, he instead began steadily moving towards the centre of the Domain Vortex.</p>
<p>[The world must be going crazy,] Xu Ding Yang thought as he could hardly believe his eyes.</p>
<p>Any cultivator who reached the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm was a master that had both extreme pride and superb methods to back it up. Xu Ding Yang was also the Sect master of a small Sect who had been cultivated diligently since childhood as a genius.</p>
<p>But compared to this young man in front of him, Xu Ding Yang couldn’t help feeling ashamed!</p>
<p>He felt his self-confidence take a hard hit.</p>
<p>Just as he momentarily lost focus, a sharp noise suddenly rang in his ears.</p>
<p>Xu Ding Yang’s expression changed and he quickly looked towards the source of this sound, his face turning pale in the next moment.</p>
<p>The defensive artifact that was protecting his body had finally reached its limit and the water curtain-like halo began to rapidly crack apart.</p>
<p>“Friend! This Xu is afraid that disaster is now inevitable. If it is convenient, please visit Scarlet Wave Star’s Blue Feather Sect and inform the Sect Elders that this Xu fell here. You may take everything in this Xu’s Space Ring as a thank you gift!” Xu Ding Yang shouted anxiously.</p>
<p>Hearing his shout, Yang Kai awoke from his comprehension and turned his eyes towards Xu Ding Yang.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes opened just in time to see the water curtain surrounding Xu Ding Yang’s body crumble into dust and the little Saint Qi which he had left erupt from his body as he desperately rushed outwards with all his strength.</p>
<p>Although he had told Yang Kai he could not escape this disaster, Xu Ding Yang obviously didn’t want to just sit and wait for the end; he was determined to put up a final struggle.</p>
<p>The rays of light surrounding his body alternated between light and dark as a fierce expression filled his face and a roar similar to that of an angry beast escaped from this throat.</p>
<p>A crackling sound rang out in the next instant as the invisible Domain crashed towards Xu Ding Yang from all directions.</p>
<p>After making it less than three steps, Xu Ding Yang suddenly shivered and stopped in place, his skin becoming red as blood leaked out from all his pores.</p>
<p><em>Peng…</em></p>
<p>With a dull thud, Xu Ding Yang’s whole body burst apart, his physique being shredded until not even his bones remained.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes shrunk slightly as his face filled with shock.</p>
<p>A master at the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm had died so tragically in front of him, making him deeply understand the horrors of this Domain Vortex. At the same time, he couldn’t help feeling some inexplicable sadness at this untimely death.</p>
<p>But soon, Yang Kai dispelled these distracting thoughts and closed his eyes once more to continue his slow trek towards the centre of the Domain Vortex step by step.</p>
<p>He and Xu Ding Yang were complete strangers, so Yang Kai wasn’t deeply affected by the latter’s death.</p>
<p>The Domain Vortex which had consigned Xu Ding Yang to his doom would not do the same to him! Yang Kai was completely confident of this.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s Shi shuttled back and forth in the surrounding space, allowing Yang Kai to sense the mysterious power that flooded this place, absorb it, remove what was useless to him and turn what was useful to him into nutrients for his own growth.</p>
<p>The killing power surrounding Yang Kai could not stop him from continuing his exploration as he slowly but surely advanced further.</p>
<p>Without using any kind of defensive artifact, and only circulating his Saint Qi to the minimum required level, Yang Kai used his flesh and blood body as well as his Shi to resist this Domain Vortex, allowing him to feel its mysteries in the most unobstructed manner possible.</p>
<p>As he continued to gain from this experience, Yang Kai gradually became immersed in it.</p>
<p>The benefits of Yang Kai’s intrepid physique manifested once again. Perhaps no other Origin Returning Realm master dared do this, only able to use their Shi to resist the Domain here to gain benefits.</p>
<p>This indirect method was vastly inferior to Yang Kai’s reckless method.</p>
<p>Yang Kai not only used his Shi, but also his own flesh and blood.</p>
<p>He was able to gain benefits at a much more rapid rate than other Origin Realm cultivators this way.</p>
<p>As time passed, at a certain moment, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes, his body shivered, and his Shi suddenly expanded outward.</p>
<p>The Domain Vortex, which made it difficult for any who entered it to even walk, didn’t put up the slightest resistance and Yang Kai was able to take large strides forward and arrive at its centre in short order.</p>
<p>This was the spot where the Domain Vortex’s pressure was most intense, as well as the spot where Xu Ding Yang had died. There were still residual bits of hashed meat from what was once Xu Ding Yang’s corpse as well as a thick smell of blood lingering in the air.</p>
<p>Yang Kai stood there, silently, gradually retracting his Shi, allowing the surrounding Domain to press down on him.</p>
<p>The terrifying power in this location caused Yang Kai’s bones to creak, as if they were about to snap. The power of the Domain Vortex at this point seemed to want to grind him into dust.</p>
<p>Five-coloured light suddenly burst from Yang Kai’s figure as his Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi filled every muscle in his body, augmenting his physical strength enormously, allowing him to compete with the power of this Domain.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face flushed and his blood boiled, as if he would explode and die at any moment.</p>
<p>However, his harvest grew even bigger at this moment.</p>
<p>From this extreme experience, Yang Kai was able to deeply realize the mysteries of Domain and his understanding of Shi simultaneously became far more profound.</p>
<p>Unsatisfied with just this, after confirming that his life was in no danger, Yang Kai fell into a deeper level of meditative cultivation.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had a premonition that participating in this Blood Prison Trial would grant him unimaginable growth.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1592, Interesting Thing</h2>
<p>Originally, Yang Kai was not very interested in this Blood Prison Trial; after all, this place was almost exclusively for Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators to temper themselves and seek opportunities.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was only at the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm, and even though he could fight opponents above his realm and wasn’t afraid of anyone below the Origin King Realm, his lack of cultivation was a fact. Yang Kai thought he wouldn’t be able to gain much from the Blood Prison so he hadn’t hesitated to leave Qian Tong and the others on Green Mountains Star while he went to Tong Xuan Realm to find his relatives and friends.</p>
<p>However, since Shan Qing Luo told him about the Domain Stones that formed inside the Blood Prison, he became interested.</p>
<p>Now that he was here, Yang Kai fully understood that even without any Domain Stones, he could gain unimaginable benefits simply by relying on the Domain Vortices which filled the Blood Prison.</p>
<p>As long as one’s ability was sufficient, any Origin Returning Realm cultivator could further condense their Shi with assistance from these Domain Vortices, pushing them closer to the grand accomplishment stage! This had nothing to do with one’s cultivation.</p>
<p>Having said that, there were probably very few that could really do this.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Yang Kai was one such individual.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a hundred kilometres outside the Blood Prison, atop a high mountain, there was an elegant stone pavilion.</p>
<p>At this moment, seven cultivators sat inside this stone pavilion, some who looked old, some who looked young, some who were male, while others were female, but without exception, all these cultivators were Origin Kings.</p>
<p>Anyone who saw such a terrifying lineup would be shocked.</p>
<p>This was definitely a tyrannical gathering.</p>
<p>These masters sat in various positions inside the stone pavilion, some with their eyes closed in meditation while others discussed the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao or even just casually observed their surroundings.</p>
<p>These top masters had come from various Cultivation Stars from across the entire Star Field!</p>
<p>Naturally, these masters hadn’t rushed here for the Blood Prison Trial to seek entertainment, but rather to recruit top talents.</p>
<p>All of them were waiting for the day when the cultivators that entered the Blood Prison emerged.</p>
<p>Entering the Blood Prison and being able to leave safely meant that a cultivator had great potential. Even if they couldn’t ultimately break through to the Origin King Realm in the future, they would still no doubt become a top master in the Origin Returning Realm.</p>
<p>Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce naturally welcomed such experts, as did Purple Star, Sword Union, etc.</p>
<p>It could be said that these seven Origin King Realm masters represented the several great forces that reigned supreme over the Star Field.</p>
<p>Every time the Blood Prison Trial opened, representatives would come to Green Mountains Star to seek talents for their great force to cultivate.</p>
<p>Of course, some also came here for the Domain Stones exclusively produced inside the Blood Prison.</p>
<p>These Origin King Realm cultivators obviously had no use for Domain Stones personally, but they had descendants and disciples who needed them. In short, every Domain Stone brought out from the Blood Prison could sell for an incredible price.</p>
<p>Among these seven Origin Kings, there was one man who wore golden robes and had a purple gold crown atop his head who was the most conspicuous. When the other masters present looked at him, they all wore dignified expressions.</p>
<p>This man looked like he was only about thirty or so years old and had sharp, sword-like brows. His expression was stern and dignified, as if he had been born into a high position, giving him a noble air.</p>
<p>At this moment, this man had his eyes closed and seemed to be resting.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his eyes opened and he mumbled under his breath in a soft voice, seemingly surprised.</p>
<p>All the other Origin Kings in the surrounding area looked towards him one after another.</p>
<p>An old woman frowned pensively for a moment before asking with a chuckle, “Sir Luo Hai, did you find something interesting? If it’s convenient, could you tell us about it? We are well aware that on Green Mountains Star, only you, the Star Master, can sense some things inside the Blood Prison.”</p>
<p>Another master nodded and said, “Yes, although this place is very close to the Blood Prison, only you can truly sense anything inside of it. Our Divine Senses simply cannot penetrate the barrier surrounding this place, so we can only ask you. What is happening inside now?”</p>
<p>The man named Luo Hai smiled, stood up, and said unhurriedly, “This King did find something interesting, but it’s not a big deal. You don’t have to make such a fuss. En, it seems that for this time’s Blood Prison Trial, a little fellow at the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm went in.”</p>
<p>“Oh? A Second-Order Origin Returning Realm?” The old woman looked surprised.</p>
<p>The others were also surprised.</p>
<p>“A Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator entering the Blood Prison isn’t without precedent, but there are very few instances of it happening and their fates have always been quite tragic. Essentially all who tried died after only a day or two. Most of them were just small characters with eyes that failed to see. I’m afraid it’s the same for this person,” The old woman shook her head slowly with a hint of contempt.</p>
<p>“En, such hot-headed youths won’t settle down unless they suffer a bit. The Blood Prison Trial has always been for Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators, and although there are no explicit rules forbidding others to enter, ten thousand years of experience has proved that such ideas are not wise!”</p>
<p>“Brother Luo Hai, what’s the situation of that little guy now? You being interested in him must mean he has done something extraordinary, yes?” A beautiful woman smiled and looked at Luo Hai. This beautiful woman had an enchanting visage and a First-Order Origin King cultivation, but she still acted cautiously when facing Luo Hai.</p>
<p>This was not just because Luo Hai’s cultivation was higher than her own by a Minor Realm, but because this was Green Mountains Star, Luo Hai’s territory!</p>
<p>No one was stupid enough to oppose a Star Master on their Cultivation Star!</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, even if a top master at the Third-Order Origin King Realm came here, they might not be able to kill Luo Hai on Green Mountains Star.</p>
<p>Here, he was the master.</p>
<p>When Luo Hai broke through to the Third-Order Origin King Realm, any master who came to Green Mountains Star would need to give him face, and Luo Hai, who had refined a Star Source, definitely had such potential!</p>
<p>Therefore, the Origin King Realm masters present, while afraid of Luo Hai, also took a flattering attitude towards him.</p>
<p>“He didn’t have any kind of impressive performance,” Luo Hai smiled slightly, “It’s just that this King hasn’t seen such an interesting little fellow in quite a long time, so I was simply a bit curious. En, he seems to have rushed into a Domain Vortex now though, but the specific situation is something even this King cannot investigate; after all, even though this King is the Star Master of Green Mountains Star, his Divine Sense is greatly restricted inside the Blood Prison.”</p>
<p>“He rushed into a Domain Vortex?” The old woman sighed lightly, “It looks like he’ll be dead soon. There are always youngsters who don’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth.”</p>
<p>“He’s only getting what he deserves!”</p>
<p>“Forget it, there’s no need to pay any attention to him, he won’t live long. What I’m more interested in is if any good seedlings will survive this trial.”</p>
<p>“En, all of us have come to Green Mountains Star for this once in a millennium opportunity, right?”</p>
<p>Hearing everyone chattering amongst themselves, Luo Hai smiled and interjected, “Everyone, this King knows your purpose in coming here, but let this King warn you: If you see any good seedlings this time, you must not use force to bring them back with you, everything must be voluntary. This King, as the Star Master of Green Mountains Star, has an obligation and responsibility to protect these youngsters and ensure they receive fair treatment.”</p>
<p>“Brother Luo Hai need not worry, over all these years, which one of us has ever tried to use force? Of course, everything will be up to these Juniors’ will,” the beautiful woman pursed her lips and smiled.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to recruit anyone; this old master came here this time simply to buy Domain Stones. Heh heh, after all, these little brats will surely be able to collect a few,” A pale-haired old man grinned meaningfully, his expression turning somewhat unwillingly as he pined, “If it weren’t for Brother Luo Hai forbidding it, this old master would have preferred to enter the Blood Prison himself to search for Domain Stones.”</p>
<p>“Brother Zhou is mistaken,” Luo Hai shook his head, “It’s not that this King refuses to allow it, it’s simply that the Blood Prison has a barrier around it which was erected by Green Mountains Star’s previous Star Master before his death, one that shuts out any Origin King. While this King is now the new Star Master of Green Mountains Star, he still cannot do anything about this. It may be several thousand years before this King breaks through to the Third-Order Origin King Realm and is finally able ignore this barrier.”</p>
<p>“The previous generation’s Star Master put up a barrier?” Everyone was shocked, as if they had never heard such information.</p>
<p>“Yes, this King has never publicized it but this is a fact. Why else do you think that during that great war thousands of years ago, no one fled from the Blood Prison?”</p>
<p>“It was because of that barrier?” Someone showed a thoughtful look.</p>
<p>“En, this barrier was created using the power of Green Mountains Star itself and not only blocked the entry of an Origin King from the outside, but also stopped everyone already inside from leaving,” Luo Hai gently nodded.</p>
<p>“No wonder, no wonder more than twenty masters with such cultivation died inside. It turns out there was such a reason,” Someone muttered in understanding.</p>
<p>Many questions surrounded that war all those years ago, but the biggest was no doubt why there had been no survivors.</p>
<p>Even if that battle had been unprecedented in scale and intensity, involving a massive number of Origin Kings, logically speaking, it was impossible for absolutely no one to survive since entire Sects were involved.</p>
<p>However, the ancient records clearly stated that there had been no survivors.</p>
<p>Now listening to Luo Hai’s explanation, everyone understood.</p>
<p>With a barrier created using the power of Green Mountains Star, without the Star Master’s permission, no other Origin King could possibly escape. The final result may have been that the previous generation’s Star Master was greatly outnumbered and decided to take all his enemies down together with him.</p>
<p>Knowing the truth about the formation of the Blood Prison, everyone couldn’t help sighing and falling silent.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, three days passed by.</p>
<p>Suddenly Luo Hai let out another cry of surprise.</p>
<p>“Sir Luo Hai, have you discovered something else of interest?” The old woman frowned and asked.</p>
<p>“Interesting, truly interesting,” Luo Hai raised his brow, a look of pure surprise filling his face as he quickly said. “That little boy managed to emerge from that Domain Vortex!”</p>
<p>“What?” The old woman was shocked.</p>
<p>“Brother Luo Hai, you mean that little Second-Order Origin Returning Realm boy you mentioned before?” The beautiful woman was also shocked.</p>
<p>“Indeed! Curious, how did he manage to survive?” Luo Hai wore a suspicious look. Even though he was the Star Master of Green Mountains Star, he could not monitor the exact situation inside the Blood Prison, so Yang Kai managing to survive truly came as a surprise to him.</p>
<p>“Could it be that the Domain Vortex he entered was very weak?” Someone speculated, “The Domain Vortices in Blood Prison are endless, but some are so weak they aren’t even worth mentioning. He should have encountered such a Domain Vortex, right?”</p>
<p>“No! Not long before, a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm died in that same Domain Vortex, so it was definitely not weak,” Luo Hai slowly shook his head, denying that person’s guess.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1593, None Of My Business</h2>
<p>When they learned that a cultivator at the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm could escape from such a Domain Vortex, the Origin King Realm masters in the stone pavilion suddenly went into a flurry.</p>
<p>They all immediately realized that this Origin Realm boy had unimaginable potential.</p>
<p>“Heh heh, this little guy, this old lady wants to reserve for Sword Union,” The old woman chuckled lightly, “If he can emerge from the Blood Prison alive, this old lady will take him back to the Home Star of Sword Union and cultivate him vigorously.”</p>
<p>“Senior Sister Lei, are you sleep talking?” A scholarly dressed middle-aged sneered, “You think a few words are enough to lay claim? Shouldn’t you ask all your friends here if they agree first? Such a good seedling, my Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce naturally doesn’t want to give up either.”</p>
<p>“Count my Purple Star in as well,” The beautiful woman called out.</p>
<p>“This old lady doesn’t care! If he can come out alive, this old lady only wants him, everyone else will be up to you all to decide,” The old woman declared in a resolute tone.</p>
<p>“Senior Sister Lei, you can’t act arbitrarily here. None of us knows who this boy is, where he comes from, or whether he has some kind of backer behind him. Even if he does not have some strong background though, are you sure he will willingly follow you, Senior Sister Lei? Perhaps he will be more optimistic about my Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce; after all, in the Star Field, Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce is more famous than Sword Union,” The middle-aged man, not wanting to be outdone, said in a somewhat smug tone.</p>
<p>“As far as fame is concerned, our three forces aren’t much different, right?” The beautiful woman pursed her lips and giggled in disagreement, “Perhaps he will be more interested in my Purple Star.”</p>
<p>The old woman gave a cold snort and said with an unkind expression, “Do you two really intend to fight with this old lady for that little boy?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that we wish to fight with Senior Sister Lei, it’s just that you are being unreasonable,” The middle-aged man slowly shook his head.</p>
<p>“Enough, don’t quarrel!” Luo Hai frowned and interrupted the trio, “It’s still not even certain whether this boy will make it out alive, so why are you three bickering here like this? Perhaps he was only lucky to escape that Domain Vortex and will not be able to hold out until the end. If he were to die mid-way after all of you made such a fuss, wouldn’t it just end up turning into an embarrassment for you?”</p>
<p>When Luo Hai spoke, the three of them winced slightly before nodding in agreement.</p>
<p>The old woman added, “Sir Luo Hai, please pay attention to that little boy’s movements. If he dies inside, please inform us so we don’t continue waiting in vain.”</p>
<p>“This King will do his best,” Luo Hai gently nodded.</p>
<p>“Many thanks, Sir Luo Hai,” The old woman quickly thanked.</p>
<p>Calm was then restored to the stone pavilion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inside the Blood Prison, Yang Kai picked up the Space Ring on the ground, shrouded himself in his Shi, then walked outwards leisurely.</p>
<p>The terrifying Domain Vortex could not suppress him at all, and Yang Kai traversed it as easily as he would flat open ground, exiting its area of influence in short order.</p>
<p>After a few days of resisting and silently feeling this Domain Vortex, Yang Kai felt that his Shi had grown significantly and his understanding and control over it had deepened a level.</p>
<p>This was something meditation alone could not achieve.</p>
<p>The Blood Prison really was a treasure trove!</p>
<p>Standing in place, Yang Kai used his Divine Sense to seep into Xu Ding Yang’s Space Ring before quietly putting it away.</p>
<p>There was nothing in Xu Ding Yang’s Space Ring that was of great interest to him. Although Xu Ding Yang’s wealth was quite substantial compared to other Origin Returning Realm masters, Yang Kai’s standards were incredibly high, so he would not be moved by such meagre gains.</p>
<p>As for Xu Ding Yang’s request before he died, Yang Kai did not care.</p>
<p>The two had met by chance and shared no friendship, nor had Yang Kai ever agreed to his request. He wouldn’t make a trip all the way to Scarlet Wave Star to deliver a message to Blue Feather Sect for a stranger.</p>
<p>If there was a chance, he would not mind doing so, but Yang Kai simply left things up to destiny.</p>
<p>Raising his head and picking a direction, Yang Kai began moving forward again.</p>
<p>The Blood Prison was different from other places Yang Kai had gone to explore in the past. Whether it was the Flowing Flame Sand Field on Shadowed Star or the Emperor Garden, they were extremely wide and there were many entry restrictions. So, even if a lot of people entered, there would be few opportunities to meet others.</p>
<p>The Blood Prison was different.</p>
<p>Although the Blood Prison covered a wide area, it had also existed for over ten thousand years and was famous across the Star Field, attracting countless Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters to it each time it opened, allowing Yang Kai to often encounter strangers along his way.</p>
<p>Most people didn’t want to make trouble, and as soon as they noticed the aura of a stranger, they would change direction to avoid conflict.</p>
<p>However, when others realized that Yang Kai was only a Second-Order Origin Realm cultivation, all of them showed stunned expressions which quickly turned to scorn or sympathy, as if he was about to die.</p>
<p>Naturally, Yang Kai paid no attention to these people.</p>
<p>He encountered several life or death struggles among cultivators as well.</p>
<p>The great forces of the Star Field certainly did not live in harmony. Many great forces had grievances between them, and when their members encountered one another inside the Blood Prison, it was obvious that fights would break out.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not try to involve himself in such matters and instead focused on searching for Domain Vortices, hoping to gain more benefits from them and further condense his Shi.</p>
<p>This cautious approach worked well for him, and half a month after entering the Blood Prison, Yang Kai had yet to get involved in any kind of fight. He had encountered three powerful Domain Vortices and entered them without hesitation, leaving each one a few days later safe and sound after reaping a great harvest.</p>
<p>His Shi raced past the minor accomplishment stage and was now steadily advancing towards the grand accomplishment stage.</p>
<p>However, to his disappointment, Yang Kai was unable to find the special product of the Blood Prison: Domain Stones.</p>
<p>The formation of Domain Stones was inseparable from the existence of Domain. The Domains which had survived for countless years in Blood Prison had been absorbed by some peculiar jades that formed into Domain Stones after constant condensation.</p>
<p>Therefore, Domain Stones generally existed inside Domain Vortices. In short, if one wanted to obtain Domain Stones, they needed to enter Domain Vortices.</p>
<p>Yang Kai felt that his luck was not very good.</p>
<p>One day, as he was looking for Domain Vortices, Yang Kai suddenly heard a series of loud sounds that seemed to be approaching him.</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned as he immediately recognized the sounds of battle.</p>
<p>He subconsciously wanted to avoid it, but when his Divine Sense swept forward to investigate, he suddenly paused in place and stared suspiciously.</p>
<p>He noticed that one of the approaching auras was somewhat familiar.</p>
<p>The cultivator who was rushing towards this place obviously also discovered the existence of Yang Kai and increased their speed dramatically, rushing straight towards him.</p>
<p>After a short while, a streak of light appeared in Yang Kai’s eyes and ten breaths later, a graceful yet somewhat disheveled figure landed in front of him.</p>
<p>“You?” Yang Kai frowned, showing a look of surprise.</p>
<p>It was actually Xue Sun of Fierce Crab Territory, one of the Monster Race masters who had accompanied him here from Monster Emperor Star.</p>
<p>At this moment, her aura was somewhat unsteady, and it was obvious that she had some injuries on her body. Her green dress was dyed red, but it was unclear whether it was her blood or her enemies’. After landing in front of Yang Kai, she gasped for breath while staring at him with a complicated gaze.</p>
<p>She also did not seem to expect that the one standing here would actually be this human boy.</p>
<p>She had only sensed a somewhat familiar aura here and wanted to ask for help.</p>
<p>“You look quite distressed, are you hurt?” Yang Kai looked her up and down.</p>
<p>“Enough with the sarcasm, obviously I’m being pursued,” Xue Sun replied coldly, her attitude quite unfriendly as she declared bluntly, “Help me.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai raised his eyes and looked behind her, seeing two figures rushing over towards them with clear murderous intent leaking from them.</p>
<p>“Why should I? This is none of my business, right?” Yang Kai frowned. If he had known that it was Xue Sun approaching, he would have left long ago.</p>
<p>Xue Sun’s eyes flashed a little helplessly as she bit her red lips lightly and said, “Believe it or not, I have a good relationship with Sister Qing Luo.”</p>
<p>“That still has nothing to do with me,” Yang Kai chuckled lightly. Did she think that by saying she was close with Shan Qing Luo, it would be enough for him to support her unconditionally? Shaking his head, Yang Kai declared, “I think you’ve made some kind of mistake here, I’m just a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator. You’d best run away quickly, those two are about to catch up, if you don’t leave now, it’ll be too late.”</p>
<p>“Even if you are only at the Second-Order, you can’t be taken lightly. I know what happened back at the palace, you defeated Xue Lian easily, so you’re not weaker than me!” Xue Sun was obviously unwilling to give up the reinforcements she had luckily found.</p>
<p>Yang Kai still shook his head, “Girl, your current situation isn’t that bad, is it? With your strength, even if you cannot beat those two, there shouldn’t be a problem for you to run away, why try to drag me into this mess?”</p>
<p>Clearly seeing this, Yang Kai did not want to intervene.</p>
<p>Xue Sun’s persistence annoyed him as it felt like she was trying to use him.</p>
<p>“Of course I can escape,” Xue Sun replied proudly, “But have you ever thought about it? I belong to the Monster Race. If I flee so openly through the Blood Prison, once other Human Race masters notice me, how do you think they will react? Won’t they try to hunt me down? Fleeing will only make my situation worse!”</p>
<p>“True enough,” Yang Kai admitted, not having thought of this before.</p>
<p>“Help me kill one of them, I’ll solve the other myself,” Xue Sun stared straight at Yang Kai and quickly said. “If you do, I’ll owe you a favour.”</p>
<p>“Who cares about a favour, what real benefits can you offer me?” Yang Kai asked casually, sweeping his eyes up and down her, and pausing for a moment on her rich, heaving peaks.</p>
<p>A look of disgust flashed across Xue Sun’s beautiful eyes, squirming slightly to hide her figure as she asked lightly, “What benefits do you want?”</p>
<p>“It’s not about what I want, but what you can offer,” Yang Kai raised his brow.</p>
<p>Xue Sun frowned, a trace of hesitation appearing on her pretty face, but as she glanced back and saw her pursuers closing in, she grit her teeth and said, “I found a Domain Stone but didn’t have enough time to collect it. I can lead you to its location.”</p>
<p>“A Domain Stone?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up and nodded immediately, “Deal!”</p>
<p>Seeing him only care about profits like this, the disgust in Xue Sun’s eyes became even stronger.</p>
<p>She really could not understand why Shan Qing Luo, who was always so prideful and arrogant, had taken a liking for such a man. After this trip, she had to make an effort to persuade her Sister Qing Luo to avoid this bastard, so he would not ruin her bright future.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1594, I Don’t Like Killing Women</h2>
<p>Just as Xue Sun was considering her options, the two people who were chasing her suddenly landed a hundred metres away.</p>
<p>The pair consisted of one man and one woman. The man had skin so white that most women would be jealous of him, but the aura pulsing from his body was so strong it could not be ignored.</p>
<p>The female had a bewitching appearance with thick makeup and clothes with high exposure, her white thighs and arms completely exposed to the air, drawing in man’s attention unconsciously. Her eyes were both limpid and filled with seductive appeal.</p>
<p>When she landed, the woman glanced towards Yang Kai and her beautiful eyes lit up as interest flashed across her face. Giggling eagerly, said to the man next to her, “Senior Brother, this boy has a good figure.”</p>
<p>“Junior Sister fancies him?” The man didn’t seem the least bit surprised, instead just inspecting Yang Kai with interest for a moment before nodding, “His physique is quite good, exactly the type you like.”</p>
<p>While saying so, he squeezed the seductive woman’s plump bottom right in front of Yang Kai and Xue Sun as he grinned wickedly, “Junior Sister, are you tempted?”</p>
<p>“Senior Brother…” The woman blushed pink as she whispered back, “Junior Sister just wants to have a little fun with this boy, it’s you who she truly loves.”</p>
<p>“Senior Brother knows.” The man grinned meaningfully.</p>
<p>Yang Kai and Xue Sun were dumbfounded watching this display.</p>
<p>Although Xue Sun was a Monster Race cultivator and inherited some of the Monster Race’s bold temperament, she couldn’t bear watching this kind of scene. The loose aura that seemed to radiate from this pair made her sick.</p>
<p>“Two good-for-nothings!” Yang Kai glanced over at Xue Sun, frowned and asked, “Is this guy chasing after you because of your beauty?”</p>
<p>Xue Sun heard these words and glared at Yang Kai fiercely, grinding her teeth as she spat, “Keep your sarcasm to yourself.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai just chuckled lightly.</p>
<p>Seeing them look confident and indifferent, the man and woman who had been chasing after Xue Sun were a little surprised. The man looked at Yang Kai seriously for a moment but soon couldn’t help laughing, “A Second-Order Origin Returning Realm boy actually dares enter the Blood Prison? Interesting, Junior Sister, this boy seems quite bold.”</p>
<p>“I like men who are bold,” The seductive woman stuck out her tongue and licked her red lips, her interest in Yang Kai growing as her expression became more and more enchanting and she shifted her posture to further emphasize her luscious curves.</p>
<p>“Alright, then this boy belongs to you,” The man nodded before pointing to Xue Sun and declaring, “This enchanting woman belongs to me. Senior Brother has lived for so many years but this is the first chance he has had to play with such a high-quality Monster Race. This will definitely be enjoyable! Enchantress, could it be that you rushed here counting on this brat to save your life? I advise you to surrender without a fight. This Li always shows tender affection to beauties, and as long as you cooperate, I won’t make things too difficult for you, even allowing you to experience physical and spiritual bliss. How about it?”</p>
<p>He spoke as if he didn’t consider Xue Sun or Yang Kai any threat at all.</p>
<p>“A dog’s mouth can’t spit out ivory,” Xue Sun coldly snorted before shouting, “I’ll leave that woman to you, this bastard is mine.”</p>
<p>“Can we trade? I don’t like killing women…” Yang Kai glanced over at her, but before he could finish speaking, Xue Sun had already rushed out, her Monster Qi exploding fiercely and violently as it crashed towards her opponent.</p>
<p>In an instant, Xue Sun was locked in combat with the man, leaving Yang Kai and the seductive woman alone and staring at each other.</p>
<p>“Little brother, did you just say you want to kill me?” The seductive woman didn’t show any concern for her Senior Brother and instead focused her attention on Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai grinned and replied, “How could I be willing to kill a woman like you?”</p>
<p>The woman was surprised for an instant but soon let out pleasant laughter as she directed an amorous gaze towards Yang Kai and said, “Since that’s the case, why don’t we find a quiet place to sit down and talk instead? Little brother looks quite young, so Elder Sister here is also reluctant to embarrass you.”</p>
<p>As she spoke, she exhaled an orchid scent, and a sweet fragrance suddenly filled the air, lingering at the tip of Yang Kai’s nose.</p>
<p>This sweet aroma was like an invisible little hand that stroked the depths of Yang Kai’s heart, causing his blood to boil and his heartbeat to race.</p>
<p>Stepping forward, the woman extended her delicate, jade white hand to stroke Yang Kai’s cheek, her eyes filled with tender affection, her movements enough to make any man lower their vigilance and allow her to do whatever she pleased.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Yang Kai smiled brilliantly, but before the woman’s hand could touch him, a cold light suddenly appeared in his eyes and he ruthlessly grabbed her wrist.</p>
<p>Caught off guard, the woman’s wrist was easily captured by Yang Kai.</p>
<p>The charming woman’s beautiful face changed slightly and she couldn’t help letting out a light moan as she looked at Yang Kai aggrievedly and said, “Little brother, you’re hurting me.”</p>
<p>Saying so, she shook her arm slightly, twisting it like a snake as she tried to free herself from Yang Kai’s control.</p>
<p>Yang Kai grinned fiercely as he tightened his grip on her wrist and forcefully yanked her towards him.</p>
<p>Realizing that she could not resist Yang Kai’s wild strength, the woman’s face finally changed and silently, a pair of long, needle-shaped artifacts appeared in her free hand which she swiftly thrust towards her captor’s waist and abdomen.</p>
<p>Relaxing her jade arms as she settled in close to Yang Kai, the woman’s breathing suddenly became heavy and a watery mist appeared in her beautiful eyes as she gently exhaled onto his face, giggling as she said, “These Seven Emotions and Six Desires Needles are Elder Sister’s exclusive artifacts. Little brother, be obedient now and Elder Sister will satisfy you.”</p>
<p>“Seven Emotions and Six Desires Needles was it?” Yang Kai grinned mockingly, “They’re a bit lacking in my opinion.”</p>
<p>The charming woman’s smile immediately stiffened on her face and as she glanced downwards she was shocked to discover that Yang Kai’s waist and abdomen had a purple light curtain protecting them. Her needle-shaped artifacts were completely blocked by this purple light.</p>
<p>Immediately, she let out a shout and pushed her Saint Qi fiercely, delivering a palm to Yang Kai’s chest.</p>
<p>Yang Kai coldly snorted and sent a fist covered in black Demonic Flames towards her palm.</p>
<p><em>Hong…</em></p>
<p>When the two Saint Qis collided, the woman’s jade hand was unable to withstand Yang Kai’s violent strength and she was easily deflected, the residual force of his punch landing squarely on her well-rounded peaks with a loud, bone-snapping sound.</p>
<p>A scream rang out as the woman was sent flying like a paper kite with a broken string.</p>
<p>The black Demonic Flames burned the clothes on her chest, revealing an alluring white spring scenery that could infatuate any man who saw it; however, this picturesque scene was soon scorched by the intense Demonic Flames.</p>
<p>Red blood dripped down her chest and flowed onto her thighs, forming a sharp contrast with her fair skin, adding a touch of scarlet to her beauty.</p>
<p>The woman staggered as she desperately pushed her Saint Qi, but upon finally stabilizing herself and standing mid-air, when she lowered her gaze and saw what had become of her chest, her face immediately distorted and she screamed at Yang Kai in hysterical hatred, “I’ll kill you!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression turned cold and stern. A golden light flashed in front of him as two Golden Blood Threads appeared, transformed into arrows, and shot mercilessly towards the woman.</p>
<p>The woman was shocked. She never expected that this boy with only a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation would be so powerful.</p>
<p>She thought she would be able to easily deal with him, making him bow down and beg to become her slave.</p>
<p>It was only now that she realized how wrong she was.</p>
<p>This Second-Order boy wasn’t inferior to any Third-Order master, possibly even stronger.</p>
<p>As the two golden lights shot towards her, the woman did not dare to neglect them, her tender body flickering as a light blue Artifact Armour immediately appeared, wrapping around her while at the same time she waved her hands and sent out a series of needle-shaped artifacts once more.</p>
<p>With a clinking sound, the two Golden Blood Threads were blocked by her strike.</p>
<p>But before the woman could breathe a sigh of relief, the two Golden Blood Threads suddenly transformed into two red and gold lizard Monster Beasts with giant wings on their backs.</p>
<p>“Thunder Flame Flying Lizards!” The woman’s expression filled with shock as she was unable to understand anything about the strange Secret Technique which was used against her.</p>
<p>The two massive Thunder Flame Flying Lizards rushed towards her from her left and right, their giant maws wide open, seemingly wanting to swallow her whole.</p>
<p>The woman’s expression became flurried and her beautiful eyes filled with terror as she couldn’t stop her tender body from shivering.</p>
<p>Before this woman could use any kind of Secret Technique, the huge claws of the right Thunder Flame Flying Lizard descended upon her and sent her flying with a muffled thud straight towards the jaws of the other Thunder Flame Flying Lizard.</p>
<p>Her light blue Artifact Armour flickered as it resisted the terrifying bite of the Thunder Flame Flying Lizard.</p>
<p>Yang Kai flew up at that moment, and right before the desperate gaze of the woman, summoned a short arrow-like artifact into his hand.</p>
<p>Feather Spirit Arrow! After charging this strange artifact, it could be used twice to display an incredible lethal attack that even a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator couldn’t ignore.</p>
<p>With a flick of his wrist, Yang Kai sent out an energy arrow towards the woman.</p>
<p>Feeling death rapidly approaching her, the woman cried out in panic, “Senior Brother, save me!”</p>
<p>Her cries for help ceased abruptly, however, when the Feather Spirit Arrow smashed her defensive Artifact Armour to pieces, and without the protection of this Artifact Armour, the Thunder Flame Flying Lizard was able to snap her in two.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that her body was fragile by any means, but there was no way she could resist the ominous force of the Thunder Flame Flying Lizard’s jaw.</p>
<p>A fresh corpse fell from the sky as the smell of blood rose to the sky.</p>
<p>The two Thunder Flame Flying Lizards distorted and transformed back into Golden Blood Threads again before swiftly returning to Yang Kai’s body.</p>
<p>Standing in place, Yang Kai pondered for a moment before showing a satisfied look.</p>
<p>Last time in Shimmering Moon City, Yang Kai had killed Mi Tian’s two Monster Beasts and used two of his Golden Blood Threads to absorb the Blood Essence of each Thunder Flame Flying Lizard and refine them into Blood Beasts. This was the first chance he had to use them in battle.</p>
<p>Their power was quite good! The most commendable thing was that once they were refined into Blood Beasts, there was no need for Yang Kai to manipulate them directly. Blood Beasts had the ability to independently confront the enemy.</p>
<p>This made Yang Kai extremely satisfied.</p>
<p>Casting his gaze towards the other battlefield, Yang Kai observed for a moment before relaxing.</p>
<p>The arrogant man from before seemed to not be Xue Sun’s opponent at all. Monster Qi soared, completely suppressing the man’s aura, indicating that Xue Sun had the absolute upper hand.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1595, Domain Stone</h2>
<p>It wasn’t that this man’s strength wasn’t equal to Xue Sun’s, however; if the two were to fight at their full power, they would likely be well-matched opponents.</p>
<p>Even if Xue Sun was somewhat stronger, the difference wasn’t great, at least not to the point where she could easily kill her opponent one on one.</p>
<p>The deciding factor in their battle was the great shock Yang Kai’s lightning-fast victory had brought to the man.</p>
<p>The cry for help from the seductive woman before her death had greatly disturbed his concentration, making him unable to face his opponent with all his strength.</p>
<p>What’s more, Yang Kai was still standing nearby, eying him covetously, causing the man to only grow more and more unnerved.</p>
<p>He couldn’t figure out how his Junior Sister had died after just a few breaths of time!</p>
<p>He was very familiar with his Junior Sister’s strength and knew that she was no weaker than him, so how was this possible? In such a short time, she had actually died at the hands of a Second-Order Origin Realm cultivator!</p>
<p>The man was thoroughly shocked and had no idea what happened between his Junior Sister and the strange young man.</p>
<p>Fear of the unknown disturbed his concentration greatly, so how could he display his full strength? Naturally, Xue Sun didn’t miss this opportunity to vent her anger and used various artifacts and Secret Techniques that belonged to the Monster Race to pummel her opponent.</p>
<p>The man was completely suppressed, and the battle quickly became one-sided.</p>
<p>Obviously unwilling to just sit and wait for death, the man suddenly bit his tongue and spat out a mist of Blood Essence, displayed the powerful Secret Technique to repel Xue Sun for a moment, then flickered as he shot off into the distance.</p>
<p>He had decided to flee, not daring to continue entangling with Xue Sun.</p>
<p>Before leaving though, this man glanced over at Yang Kai and found that this unfathomable youth was just standing there, seemingly not intending to stop him, a fact which allowed him to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Just when he thought he thought he had escaped from death, however, the space around him suddenly became viscous.</p>
<p>His figure stalled in place involuntarily and his eyes narrowed as he screamed in horror, “Shi!”</p>
<p>He was also a master at the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, so he naturally understood the mysteries of Shi, so when he fell into this sticky space, he knew he had been trapped inside a powerful Shi.</p>
<p>This Shi was far stronger than his own, to the point where it frightened him. Moreover, this Shi seemed to have some kind of strange force integrated into it.</p>
<p>Not daring to neglect, he quickly released his own Shi to resist, but this only allowed him to regain a bit of freedom. He couldn’t get rid of this Shi’s suppression in short order.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a person appeared in front of his eyes, and when he looked up, he couldn’t help exclaiming, “How is that possible? How are you here?”</p>
<p>At this moment, he was shocked to discover that Yang Kai, who should have been watching him from afar, was now right in front of him. However, he hadn’t even noticed the other party’s movements.</p>
<p>“Why can’t I be here?” Yang Kai grinned as he gradually increased his Shi’s power.</p>
<p>The man caught in this Shi began to sweat as he struggled violently.</p>
<p><em>Chi Chi…</em></p>
<p>A tearing noise sounded from all directions, and when the man looked around he suddenly found that the surrounding space seemed to be collapsing, with ting, pitch-black cracks constantly appearing and disappearing around him…</p>
<p>His courage broke entirely upon seeing this! He never knew that someone’s Shi could have such an incredible effect on space.</p>
<p>At this moment, he finally understood that it was no accident that his Junior Sister had died so quickly. This Second-Order Origin Returning Realm youth was an incredibly terrifying enemy.</p>
<p>Without giving him a chance to resist, Yang Kai flicked his wrist and sent out a dozen pitch-black Space Blades one after another. These black blades easily cut through the man’s protective Saint Qi and defensive artifacts before slicing him into dozens of pieces while banishing the bulk of his physique to The Void.</p>
<p>What was left of the man’s corpse fell in the next moment and scattered about in a bloody mess.</p>
<p>Xue Sun’s beautiful eyes shrank as she witnessed this incredible scene, her tender body shivering unconsciously.</p>
<p>Although she knew that Yang Kai’s victory just now was partially due to him launching a sneak attack, his strength was beyond doubt.</p>
<p>No wonder Xue Lian had suffered a loss at his hands and Mi Tian dreaded him greatly, there was a good reason behind it.</p>
<p>Judging from his performance just now, when he dealt with Mi Tian and Xue Lian, he must have been holding back. Otherwise, how could those two still be alive?</p>
<p>Xue Sun had always thought that in the Origin Realm, Xue Lian and Mi Tian were already peak figures. Those two were existences that she looked up to and admired, but today, she learned she had simply been sitting in a well, staring up at the sky, thinking how vast it must be.</p>
<p>Origin Returning Realm masters could actually be this powerful!</p>
<p>The arrogance and disdain in her eyes quickly abated and she began to re-examine Yang Kai.</p>
<p>[Perhaps… Sister Qing Luo’s choice wasn’t wrong.] She thought in her heart.</p>
<p>When Yang Kai turned his eyes to stare at her, Xue Sun quickly averted her gaze, almost not daring to look at him. She didn’t know why she did this, but deep in her heart, a trace of fear of this young man had budded.</p>
<p>Since he could easily kill the two people who had been chasing her down in such a short time, killing her would simply be effortless!</p>
<p>Xue Sun’s figure flickered as she rushed to pick up the two ownerless Space Rings before flying over to Yang Kai and handing them to him.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Yang Kai chuckled, not refusing, putting away the two Space Rings without even inspecting them before asking, “Alright, where is that Domain Stone you mentioned?”</p>
<p>“I’ll take you there!” Xue Sun immediately volunteered before using her movement skill to fly off in a certain direction.</p>
<p>“How are your injuries?” Yang Kai followed her behind and asked casually.</p>
<p>“They’re just minor wounds, no big deal,” Xue Sun replied lightly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded then stopped talking as he followed her through the Blood Prison.</p>
<p>The place Xue Sun found the Domain Stone wasn’t too far away from their previous position, so it only took her and Yang Kai an hour to reach it.</p>
<p>“I have to tell you one thing,” Halfway, Xue Sun’s beautiful eyes flickered, as if feeling a little guilty.</p>
<p>“What?” Yang Kai looked at her suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Actually, the two people you killed have companions,” Xue Sun turned her head and looked at Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“They do? Where?” Yang Kai was stunned.</p>
<p>“Where the Domain Stone is…” Xue Sun became more anxious, gritted her teeth as she told the truth, “I found the Domain Stone first and wanted to take it, but before I could I met a group of five who all seemed to come from the same Cultivation Star. Two of them chased after me while the other three stayed behind. I don’t know if they successfully obtained the Domain Stone now, but if they have…”</p>
<p>“That’s fine, we’ll just snatch it,” Yang Kai grinned.</p>
<p>Xue Sun frowned slightly and looked at him seriously, “Aren’t you angry? I hid this from you, lied to you.”</p>
<p>“A little bit,” Yang Kai gently nodded.</p>
<p>Xue Sun’s face paled slightly.</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t make any difference to me, so I don’t really care,” Yang Kai smiled slightly. “Lead the way.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Xue Sun sighed softly, finally feeling relieved.</p>
<p>Soon after, Yang Kai raised his brow as a look of joy appeared on his face and he asked, “Is it right up ahead? I can already feel a powerful Domain fluctuation.”</p>
<p>“En,” Xue Sun nodded, speeding up as she did.</p>
<p>Before long, Yang Kai and Xue Sun came to the edge of a Domain Vortex.</p>
<p>This Domain Vortex was nearly two thousand metres across and was giving off a daunting energy fluctuation. In the centre of this Domain Vortex were several fist-sized stones with an indescribable lustre.</p>
<p>Domain Stones! Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he stared hotly towards these few Domain Stones.</p>
<p>It was the first time he saw a Domain Stone, so he was naturally curious, but because of the surrounding Domain Vortex, he couldn’t release his Divine Sense to investigate them carefully, nor could he tell exactly how many of them there were.</p>
<p>However, it was undeniable that any piece of Domain Stone had immense value. If one could successfully obtain one, they could exchange it for a lot of precious cultivation resources or simply absorb the power inside of it to promote their comprehension of the mysteries of Domain.</p>
<p>Inside the two thousand metre Domain Vortex, there were three people, each of them occupying a different position. These three were all sitting down cross-legged, releasing their Shi, seemingly trying to comprehend the mysteries of this Domain Vortex so they could dive deeper and obtain the Domain Stones.</p>
<p>The great value of Domain Stones was not only because of the power of Domain contained within it but also because of the risk of obtaining it.</p>
<p>Whenever something was rare, it became precious; this logic applied perfectly to Domain Stones.</p>
<p>Domain Stones only ever formed in Domain Vortices. If one wanted to obtain a Domain Stone, they needed to first understand the mysteries of the Domain Vortex surrounding them before they could reach the deepest point and obtain them safely.</p>
<p>Countless Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters had fallen inside Domain Vortices, their lives adding value to each Domain Stone.</p>
<p>To obtain Domain Stones, many risked their lives, some of them ultimately losing them in the process.</p>
<p>Now, it appeared several Domain Stones had formed inside the Domain Vortex in front of him, a fact that naturally made Yang Kai very excited.</p>
<p>He just casually glanced at the three strangers who had penetrated into the vortex before paying no more attention to them.</p>
<p>The Domain Vortex in front of him felt neither strong nor weak; however, it was definitely less powerful than the one that had shredded Xu Ding Yang, otherwise these three strangers would not have been able to remain inside of it safely.</p>
<p>The arrival of Yang Kai and Xue Sun naturally disturbed the three people who were sitting cross-legged inside the Domain Vortex. These three people opened their eyes and turned to look at Yang Kai and Xue Sun, at which point a white-haired old man couldn’t help calling out in surprise, “Slut, why are you still alive?”</p>
<p>Xue Sun coldly snorted, “Old dog, are you disappointed I’m still alive?”</p>
<p>“Where are Brother Li and Junior Sister Chu?” A different one-eyed man frowned and asked coldly.</p>
<p>Xue Sun sneered, “Since I’ve come back alive, what do you think happened to them?”</p>
<p>“Impossible!” The one-eyed man’s expression changed, stunned by the words Xue Sun said and unwilling to believe her.</p>
<p>“How could a mere slut like you kill Brother Li and Sister Chu? There should be a limit to shameless boasting,” The third person sneered, apparently thinking Xue Sun was talking nonsense.</p>
<p>“Believe what you want,” Xue Sun didn’t bother explaining, clenching her teeth as she swept her eyes across them and declared, “Those two died, and all of you are next!”</p>
<p>The white-haired old man was startled for a moment, but immediately burst into laughter, “Slut, you’re certain rampant enough! Good! this old master is busy with this Domain Vortex right now so he cannot deal with you immediately. Feel free to run your mouth however you like, but if you really have the courage, just wait for this old master to get out of here then he will settle our dispute once and for all.”</p>
<h2>Chapter 1596, Moving Deeper</h2>
<p>After the white-haired old man made this declaration, he glanced over at Yang Kai curiously and asked with a light smile, “Little brother, aren’t you human? Why are you colluding with this slut?”</p>
<p>“Colluding with her?” Yang Kai frowned, “Old man, aren’t you being a bit arbitrary?”</p>
<p>The old man shook his head, “Humans are humans, monsters are monsters, humans hunt monsters, monsters hunt humans. The two races are wholly incompatible, but now you’re serving this slut, what else besides colluding could you be doing?”</p>
<p>He subconsciously thought that Xue Sun, who had the stronger cultivation, was taking the lead while Yang Kai followed.</p>
<p>“This old master only wants to ask, is what this slut said about her killing Brother Li and Sister Chu true?” The old man’s expression suddenly turned solemn as he interrogated Yang Kai in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Yes, I saw them die with my own eyes,” Yang Kai gently nodded.</p>
<p>“Were you involved?” The old man narrowed his eyes as a murderous intent flashed across them.</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“On the road, I saw an injustice and drew my sword to assist!” Yang Kai replied firmly.</p>
<p>Hearing these words, Xue Sun snickered to herself.</p>
<p>“Good, good, good!” The old man nodding as his tone grew icy, “Daring to do and daring to admit! Boy, your courage is not small! This old master has memorized your appearance. Know that this Blood Prison will definitely be your grave.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled brilliantly, “Old Sir, before boasting, you should measure your own ability first, lest you stick out your tongue only to have the wind cut it off.”</p>
<p>The old man grinned viciously, “Whether this old master can back his words, he knows best. This old master does not have time to argue with you now, we will settle this after this old master takes these Domain Stones.”</p>
<p>“Take the Domain Stones?” Yang Kai raised his brow and said in an arrogant tone, “The Domain Stones belong to me, don’t even dream of touching them.”</p>
<p>The old man was startled, and his two companions were stunned, but soon they broke out into laughter.</p>
<p>The one-eyed man said with a sneer, “A little brat who hasn’t even grown hair down there wants to take these Domain Stones? You should go back to cultivate for a hundred more years first. A mere Second-Order Origin Returning Realm brat dares enter the Blood Prison.”</p>
<p>“I won’t waste any more time on you idiots, I have Domain Stones to obtain,” Yang Kai spat disdainfully before stepping towards the Domain Vortex.</p>
<p>“Be careful!” Xue Sun’s beautiful face paled as she quickly warned him.</p>
<p>She had experienced the terrifying power of this Domain Vortex already and knew just how dangerous it was.</p>
<p>The white-haired old man and his companions also gawked in amazement. They never expected Yang Kai would rush into the Domain Vortex so haphazardly. Was he courting death?</p>
<p>The old man could not help sneering as a mocking smile appeared on his face and he waited for the show to begin.</p>
<p>He was certain that Yang Kai would be crushed to death by the Domain Vortex!</p>
<p>However, in the next moment, the smile on his face went stiff.</p>
<p>The Domain Vortex which caused him and his companions so much dread was unable to stop this arrogant boy in the slightest as Yang Kai stepped forward lightly, as if he was out for a stroll.</p>
<p>The old man could not help drawing a sharp breath as his eyes flashed with shock and he focused his full attention on Yang Kai’s movements.</p>
<p>He could clearly see that the Shi which was radiating from Yang Kai’s figure was not inferior in power to his own, possibly even stronger. This invisible Shi was like a perfect armour that protected Yang Kai and allowed him to walk inward without hindrance.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this situation did not last very long. The strange young man only managed to move two hundred metres forward before his pace slowed, then after another hundred, he came to a halt.</p>
<p>Having stopped in place, Yang Kai closed his eyes and felt the strange fluctuations around him while comprehending the mysteries of this Domain.</p>
<p>Seeing this scene, the old man finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>If Yang Kai really walked straight to the centre of the Domain Vortex and snatched the Domain Stones without stopping, the old man would probably have coughed up blood.</p>
<p>Luckily, although this little brat was quite unusual, it seemed he was not able to completely ignore this Domain Vortex and had to spend time studying it before he could reach its depths.</p>
<p>[I still have a chance!] The old man’s eyes burst brightly as he got to his feet and then, ignoring the massive load on his body, advanced a short distance.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the other two were unwilling to show weakness and moved slightly deeper.</p>
<p>The closer one moved to the centre of a Domain Vortex, the stronger the pressure they would be subjected to. If one was unable to shoulder such pressure, the result would be them being shredded by the Domain.</p>
<p>Therefore, when cultivators studied the mysteries contained in a Domain Vortex, they would generally do so extremely carefully, not daring to exceed their limits lest they make a deadly miscalculation.</p>
<p>Before Yang Kai arrived, the old man and his two companions were advancing slowly, step by step, planning to steadily approach the Domain Stones before taking them.</p>
<p>But Yang Kai’s arrival and astonishing performance had made them feel a sense of crisis. They realized that if they did not speed up, they wouldn’t be able to obtain any of the Domain Stones they were after.</p>
<p>The chaotic flow around this Domain Vortex made it extremely dangerous for anyone to try to attack anyone else, otherwise, it would be very likely to trigger a strong backlash from the surrounding Domain.</p>
<p>If not for this, the old man and his companions would have struck to kill Yang Kai first. Now, however, whoever reached the centre of the vortex first and took the Domain Stones away would be the winner.</p>
<p>With treasures in front of them, no one would show weakness.</p>
<p>Outside the vortex, Xue Sun’s beautiful eyes glowed with brilliance as she stared at Yang Kai’s back in deep shock.</p>
<p>This strange man had walked three hundred metres straight into the Domain Vortex without stopping! It was like a ten-ton sledgehammer had pounded directly onto Xue Sun’s heart, causing her to become dazed and somewhat short of breath.</p>
<p>Her being sent by Fierce Crab Tribal Lord to participate in the Blood Prison Trial meant she was the strongest Origin Returning Realm master in Fierce Crab Territory.</p>
<p>The attention she received from Fierce Crab Tribal Lord and the respect and admiration of those in the same realm were enough for her to take pride in! She had never felt inferior to other Origin Returning Realm masters.</p>
<p>But today, the arrogance in her heart had taken a serious blow.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s performance made her realize that even in the Origin Realm, she had not reached the peak. In this realm, there were still people who towered over her.</p>
<p>After gritting her teeth, Xue Sun also pushed her Shi and stepped into the Domain Vortex.</p>
<p>As soon as she entered the vortex, Xue Sun’s tender body trembled slightly. From all directions, a terrifying, invisible power descended upon her, forcing her to push her Monster Qi madly in order to protect herself while she did her best to follow after Yang Kai!</p>
<p>After only advancing fifty metres, however, Xue Sun was unable to move forward again.</p>
<p>Looking up at Yang Kai at that moment, Xue Sun suddenly realized that in this very short time, he had actually moved forward again.</p>
<p>How did he do it? Xue Sun completely could not understand.</p>
<p>It had been less than half a day since she came across Yang Kai inside the Blood Prison, but her pride and self-confidence had been completely shaken. She felt she was simply incomparable with this human…</p>
<p>Xue Lian and Mi Tian were not any better either.</p>
<p>On Monster Emperor Star, all the Tribal Lords evaluated Xue Lian and Mi Tian extremely highly and believed that these two Juniors would likely break through to the Origin King Realm and become new Tribal Lords.</p>
<p>But if Xue Lian and Mi Tian were highly likely to become Origin Kings, Xue Sun was certain Yang Kai would become one.</p>
<p>Just his outstanding performance right now proved that his mastery of Shi had reached a level that surpassed nearly all Origin Realm masters. He may have even touched upon the threshold of Domain.</p>
<p>Xue Sun was awed by another Origin Returning Realm master for the first time in her life, and the back of the figure in front of her now looked like an unattainable mountain she could only gaze up upon.</p>
<p>“Impossible, that’s impossible!” The one-eyed man screamed out loud as he stared in the direction of Yang Kai and watched the latter steadily advance towards the centre of the vortex. Even if Yang Kai paused once in a while, those breaks were extremely short, and he would soon begin moving again.</p>
<p>This powerful Domain Vortex seemed incapable of barring his path at all!</p>
<p>The one-eyed man’s eyes were blank, and his face was dull as he was repeatedly shocked by Yang Kai’s actions.</p>
<p>“Calm down!” The white-haired old man suddenly yelled, “This little brat is indeed a bit weird, but we started earlier than him and he is slightly behind us, so we still have a chance. Focus now, we cannot allow this boy to succeed!”</p>
<p>Hearing what he said, the one-eyed man seemed to recover his calm and took a deep breath before nodding heavily, “I know.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Yang Kai grinned suddenly as he glanced over at the white-haired old man, “Am I still behind you? I think you should check again, Old Dog.”</p>
<p>As these words fell, Yang Kai, who had been standing in place for some time now, suddenly moved forward lightly.</p>
<p>One step, two steps, three steps… Yang Kai showed no signs of stopping at all, like a flowing river that could not be stopped, approaching the centre of the vortex where the Domain Stones laid at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>The old man was stunned, the one-eyed man was stunned, the third man was stunned.</p>
<p>Xue Sun also could not help crying out in shock as her hands covered her red lips, staring blankly in Yang Kai’s direction.</p>
<p>Yang Kai seemed to have suddenly comprehended something and as his Shi enveloped him, it repelled all the Domain’s powers, leaving no obstacles in his way.</p>
<p>In this manner, he easily reached the centre of the vortex.</p>
<p>The three men stared at this scene helplessly.</p>
<p>At this moment, they did not know what to do. If they were nearby, they would definitely go all out to block Yang Kai, but inside this Domain Vortex, they could only stand and watch.</p>
<p>Their faces became dark and bitter.</p>
<p>Suddenly, however, the old man’s eyes lit up as he discovered something extraordinary.</p>
<p>At the centre of the whirlpool, Yang Kai had stopped his foot midair, seemingly unable to tread the final step, his brow furrowed as a thoughtful look filled his face.</p>
<p>This little brat had encountered some kind of problem! The old man was overjoyed and secretly prayed that this boy would be halted where he was, or better yet, strangled to death by the Domain Vortex.</p>
<p>The old man felt that some strange movements were occurring within this Domain Vortex now and that most of its power was now being focused on Yang Kai, putting increasing pressure on him!</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s complexion gradually became dignified and sweat oozed from his forehead as the invisible Domain continued to crash towards his body.</p>
<p>The pressure the old man and his companions were under suddenly eased, and after exchanging a glance, their eyes glowed red and they rushed forward recklessly.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1597, Stay Put If You Don’t Want To Die</h2>
<p>No one had expected such a situation, and no one had ever encountered anything similar. In fact, none had even heard of such an occurrence before.</p>
<p>There were five people inside the same Domain Vortex, but most of the power of Domain was being directed towards a single person. It was as if the Domain Vortex had begun to target that person to prevent him from reaching its core.</p>
<p>The pressure of the old man and his group felt was greatly reduced, so they saw a glimmer of hope and were unwilling to just give up on the Domain Stones.</p>
<p>The three men rapidly moved towards the centre of the Domain Vortex with fierce expressions on their faces, staring at Yang Kai wickedly as they released a thick murderous aura, their intentions clearly unfriendly.</p>
<p>Xue Sun’s beautiful face changed dramatically seeing this, and after yelling to remind Yang Kai, she also tried to rush forward.</p>
<p>“Stay put if you don’t want to die!” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly rang in her ears.</p>
<p>Xue Sun’s raised foot paused mid-air as she stared at Yang Kai’s back with a fluctuating expression, her brow furrowed, not understanding what he was trying to do.</p>
<p>However, she only hesitated for a moment before deciding to believe in Yang Kai and putting her foot down.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s situation seemed very dangerous as the intense Domain flowing towards him was not something an Origin Returning Realm master could bear. It was a miracle that he was even still standing.</p>
<p>Xue Sun clearly felt that Yang Kai’s Shi could not compete with this rampaging Domain and was being suppressed back into his body.</p>
<p>Xue Sun couldn’t help getting nervous, unable to imagine what Yang Kai’s end would be like once his Shi was completely suppressed.</p>
<p>Most likely, he would die on the spot!</p>
<p>If that really happened, her sister Qing Luo would definitely be sad. Xue Sun had heard that the relationship between these two was very good…</p>
<p>As she worried, Yang Kai’s Shi collided with the swirling Domain, like two clashing armies in the midst of a desperate struggle, but clearly, Yang Kai’s Shi was on the losing side.</p>
<p>The range of Yang Kai’s Shi was shrinking little by little, and soon only covered his body.</p>
<p>The fluctuations in the Domain Vortex were becoming even more chaotic and violent, as if all of its power was being drawn towards Yang Kai. Suddenly, a fierce and merciless wave crashed towards him, completely destroying his Shi and submerging him in Domain.</p>
<p>Xue Sun unconsciously let out a scream and turned her eyes away, somewhat unable to bear seeing Yang Kai explode and die.</p>
<p>However, the sounds of flesh and blood being torn asunder and flying out never came, stunning Xue Sun. Then, a moment later, despite his seemingly desperate situation, Yang Kai let out a joy-filled burst of laughter.</p>
<p>Xue Sun turned her head back rapidly to look at Yang Kai, and to her immense surprise, found him standing there, completely submerged in the swirling Domain, completely unscathed.</p>
<p>“How is that possible?” Xue Sun was stunned.</p>
<p>She clearly didn’t feel Yang Kai releasing any Shi, yet he was standing at the very centre of the Domain Vortex perfectly safe!</p>
<p>There was a kind of mysterious force lingering around Yang Kai, allowing him to merge with the Domain Vortex. Without looking at him with her eyes, Xue Sun would definitely not be able to notice his existence. It was as if he had integrated with the Domain Vortex and become a part of it.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s foot, which had still been lifted, slammed down at that moment and he truly arrived at the most central position of the Domain Vortex.</p>
<p>With the fall of his foot, the Domain Vortex which had been chaotically flowing towards him was suddenly restored to its normal state, and its terrifying pressure which had vanished re-appeared, causing Xue Sun to let out a moan as she was once again forced to resist it.</p>
<p>The old man and his companions weren’t so lucky though.</p>
<p>When the pressure had lightened earlier, they had rushed forward greatly and were now only a hundred metres away from Yang Kai’s position.</p>
<p>But now that the Domain Vortex’s pressure had returned, how could they possibly bear it?</p>
<p>The sudden reappearance of the Domain horrified the trio and with panicked yells, they desperately pushed their Saint Qi and summoned various artifacts to protect their bodies as they attempted to draw back.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a place where they could remain. If Yang Kai hadn’t pulled most of Domain Vortex’s pressure towards himself, these three would not have been able to reach their current position.</p>
<p>However, it was undoubtedly too late to retreat now.</p>
<p>The trio couldn’t compete with the intense Domain pressure and it wasn’t long before their defensive artifacts exploded into dust. With terror-filled screams, the three men exploded one after another, painting the ground around them with hashed meat and blood…</p>
<p>Xue Sun stared at this scene in a daze. Three Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters dying in such a gruesome manner in less than three breaths caused her to shiver from head to toe.</p>
<p>At that moment, she recalled the warning Yang Kai had quietly passed her just now.</p>
<p>‘Stay put if you don’t want to die!’</p>
<p>She was now certain that if she had not listened to Yang Kai’s warning, she would have shared the same fate as those three men, dying filled with regrets.</p>
<p>Feeling like she had just escaped from death, Xue Sun’s heart pounded and her face turned pale.</p>
<p>[Did he… did he plan this all along? Was he trying to integrate himself into the Domain Vortex so it no longer affected him? Where did he get the confidence to even attempt such a feat? Just how deep is his understanding of Shi?]</p>
<p>[Has he really comprehended the mysteries of Domain?]</p>
<p>Xue Sun had countless questions filling her head, but she found it difficult to ask any of them. She only knew that the height this human had reached on the Martial Dao was something she could only look up towards.</p>
<p>Truthfully, although this Domain Vortex was indeed quite powerful, if the old man and his companions had gradually studied its mysteries and advanced at a slow and steady pace, there was a chance they could have eventually made it to the centre rather than die a miserable death.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, they didn’t have such an opportunity. Yang Kai gave them hope, then just as they were about to seize it, he sank them into despair…</p>
<p>Without any effort, he had used the power of the Domain Vortex to kill all three of them!</p>
<p>If Yang Kai had been planning this all along, he was far too devious…</p>
<p>[It must have been a coincidence, right?] Xue Sun’s expression turned extremely complicated.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Let’s go,” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly called out, startling Xue Sun slightly. When she recovered, she found that Yang Kai had at some point arrived in front of her and had two strange, lustrous stones in his hand: Domain Stones.</p>
<p>Seeing he had gotten her attention, Yang Kai tossed one of the Domain Stones to her.</p>
<p>Xue Sun caught it by reflex before turning a suspicious look towards him and frowning, “Why are you giving me one? I didn’t do anything.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai just smiled lightly and said, “You brought me here. You also discovered these Domain Stones first, so I figured I’d share. What? If you don’t want it, you can give it back.”</p>
<p>Xue Sun stuffed the Domain Stone into her Space Ring in an instant.</p>
<p>A small advantage gained by doing nothing shouldn’t be given up easily!</p>
<p>Yang Kai grinned, “I’ll divide the Domain Stones with you, but I’m keeping those three’s Space Rings. There’s nothing good inside them, but gains are gains.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have any interest in their Space Rings,” Xue Sun replied faintly, pausing for a moment before saying, “Let’s say our goodbyes here, good luck out there.”</p>
<p>“You’re not going out?” Yang Kai was surprised.</p>
<p>“I want to stay here and continue cultivating!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded, not trying to force her and simply saying, “Then I’ll wish you good luck, I’ll be going on ahead.”</p>
<p>Saying so, he walked past her and strode towards the outsider.</p>
<p>“Yang Kai!” Xue Sun suddenly shouted from behind.</p>
<p>“Hm?” Yang Kai turned his head and looked at her.</p>
<p>“Can I ask, how did you integrate yourself into the Domain Vortex?” Xue Sun looked at him curiously.</p>
<p>Yang Kai touched his chin, pondered for a moment, then smiled slightly and said, “I just followed the path my Shi flowed.”</p>
<p>“Follow your Shi?” Xue Sun frowned, carefully savouring the meaning of this sentence for a moment before suddenly her beautiful eyes lit up. Showing a grateful expression, she nodded sincerely, “Thank you!”</p>
<p>“A minor matter,” Yang Kai waved his hand gently, and walked forward without looking back, soon drifting away.</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>Over the next few days, Yang Kai continued wandering around the Blood Prison. Once he found a Domain Vortex that met his requirements, he would enter it to study its mysteries.</p>
<p>By continuously comprehending the mysteries contained in these Domain Vortices, Yang Kai’s Shi grew at a terrifying speed.</p>
<p>No Domain Vortex could pull him into a deep state of meditation anymore. In fact, Yang Kai could enter and exit most Domain Vortices at will. Even if he occasionally encountered some powerful ones and it took him some time to navigate them, he was still able to integrate himself into them and move about unimpeded without too much difficulty.</p>
<p>He found that the method Xu Ding Yang taught him before was slightly mistaken.</p>
<p>To comprehend the mysteries of Domain, using one’s Shi to fight against it was one way, but integrating one’s Shi into it could garner far deeper insights.</p>
<p>That’s why he gave such advice to Xue Sun.</p>
<p>However, if one wanted to do this, they needed to have extremely good control over their own Shi, otherwise the results would be terrible.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t find many Domain Stones as they were extremely rare, even inside the Blood Prison. Half a month after separating from Xue Sun, Yang Kai had entered dozens of big and small Domain Vortices but had only obtained two more Domain Stones.</p>
<p>As he was travelling, Yang Kai spent some time studying these peculiar products.</p>
<p>These Domain Stones contained the power of Domain inside them, making them similar to the Domain Vortices inside the Blood Prison.</p>
<p>But the power of Domain contained in these Domain Stones was extremely gentle, not violent and difficult to resist like Domain Vortices.</p>
<p>This kind of gentle force could easily and safely be absorbed by any Origin Returning Realm master to improve their understanding of Shi and to comprehend the mysteries of Domain.</p>
<p>This was one of the reasons why Domain Stones were so valuable.</p>
<p>Besides Xue Sun, Yang Kai didn’t encounter any other acquaintances, whether it was the Monster Race masters who came here from Monster Emperor Star together or Qian Tong and the others who he had left on Green Mountains Star, he did not meet a single one.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t know if Qian Tong and the others had even entered the Blood Prison, but the main reason they stayed on Green Mountains Star at the time was for this, so they obviously wouldn’t have missed this event if at all possible.</p>
<p>They should have come in; it was just that he didn’t know where they were.</p>
<p>Occasionally, Yang Kai would take out his communication artifacts and pour his Divine Sense into them to try to contact Qian Tong and the others.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even after so many days, there was no response from anyone.</p>
<p>One day, as Yang Kai was sitting cross-legged in mediation in a secluded place to recover his stamina, he took out his communication artifact to check it.</p>
<p>He didn’t really expect anything, but when he poured his Divine Sense into it, Yang Kai couldn’t help showing a happy look and quickly began scanning it carefully.</p>
<p>Qian Tong had actually responded!</p>
<p>What’s more, he had even asked for him to come to a certain rendezvous point.</p>
<p>It seemed he had found something incredible!</p>
<h2>Chapter 1598, Domain Stone Mountain</h2>
<p>A hundred kilometres outside the Blood Prison, atop a certain peak inside a certain stone pavilion, Luo Hai had his eyes closed tightly, as if he was silently sensing something.</p>
<p>The other Origin King Realm masters were all paying attention to his movements.</p>
<p>They couldn’t tell anything that was happening inside the Blood Prison, only Luo Hai, the Star Master, could somewhat probe the situation. Naturally, Luo Hai became the focus and centre of attention for everyone here.</p>
<p>After a long time, Luo Hai opened his eyes with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Sir Luo Hai, did you find something worthy of attention? Why do you seem so happy?” The old woman from Sword Union asked quickly.</p>
<p>“A fortuitous event has happened!” Luo Hai gently nodded.</p>
<p>“A fortuitous event?” The beautiful woman from Purple Star raised her brow and glanced at Luo Hai thoughtfully, showing a sudden look, “Does Brother Luo Hai mean…”</p>
<p>“Haha, yes. There is only one fortuitous event that happens inside the Blood Prison; it is exactly as you think,” Luo Hai gently nodded, quickly declaring. “The Domain Stone Mountain has appeared!”</p>
<p>“The Domain Stone Mountain has appeared?” Everyone was moved.</p>
<p>“En.”</p>
<p>“This truly is a fortuitous event!” The old woman’s wrinkled face smiled brightly, “Those little fellows who entered the Blood Prison this time are quite lucky it seems, at least more so than most.”</p>
<p>“Senior Sister Lei, why are you acting so envious? When you entered the Blood Prison two thousand years ago, didn’t you also encounter similar good fortune?” The beautiful woman pursed her lips and smiled.</p>
<p>“Hehe, en, two thousand years have passed in a flash,” A look of remembrance appeared on the old woman’s face. “If it hadn’t been for the Domain Stone Mountain back then, this old lady would probably not have been able to spy on the mysteries of Domain and break through to the Origin King Realm. It could be said that the Domain Stone Mountain is the foundation for this old lady’s current achievements!”</p>
<p>“Senior Sister Lei encountered the Domain Stone Mountain back then?” Many people showed a surprised expression, with some of them complaining, “Why didn’t I encounter such good fortune? When I entered the Blood Prison, the Domain Stone Mountain remained hidden behind such a powerful Domain field that it was impossible to even catch a glimpse of it.”</p>
<p>“This is all a matter of luck,” Luo Hai chuckled, “The Domain Stone Mountain is the treasure of the Blood Prison and is extremely strong. Even an Origin King may not necessarily be able to damage it at all. It’s also so massive that no one can take it away. It is the best place for Origin Realm Juniors to spy on the mysteries of Domain. Unfortunately, it is usually surrounded by chaotic Domains all year round that only weaken briefly at random intervals to reveal its true appearance. The Blood Prison only opens once every thousand years, and when it does, the Domain Stone Mountain does not always appear. It is normal for you to not have encountered it. But don’t envy Sister Lei’s luck, aren’t you all Origin Kings now?”</p>
<p>“That said, if I had encountered the Domain Stone Mountain back then, I would not have had to spend an additional three hundred years in cultivation to break through to my current realm.” The one who spoke earlier grumbled, sighing over how his luck was not as good as the old woman’s.</p>
<p>The old woman simply smiled and said, “Why are you sighing? This old lady’s luck was all used up at that moment. After encountering the Domain Stone Mountain and reaching the Origin King realm, this old lady has barely made any progress in her cultivation. I’m afraid that this old lady’s path will end here.”</p>
<p>“Senior Sister Lei need not belittle herself. Who can tell what will happen in one’s future cultivation? Perhaps Senior Sister Lei will receive a flash of enlightenment and breakthrough to the Second-Order Origin King Realm one day?” The beautiful woman comforted.</p>
<p>Although there was a lot of friction between the great forces in the Star Field, as Origin Kings who stood above the mundane, everyone here had some friendship between them, so offering some casual comfort was not difficult.</p>
<p>“I hope so,” The old woman smiled reluctantly before frowning again with a worried expression on her face. “But although the appearance of the Domain Stone Mountain is a fortuitous event, it also increases the difficulty of this trial greatly. Back then, when this old lady was fighting for a good position near the Domain Stone Mountain, she nearly died. This time, I’m afraid many will die in the competition.”</p>
<p>“It may be a blessing or a curse, it all depends on one’s own good fortune. In any case, it is useless for us to worry about it here,” The old man from Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce shook his head slowly.</p>
<p>“Fair enough. By the way, Sir Luo Hai, what’s the situation of that little Second-Order Origin Returning Realm boy like now? Is he still alive?” The old woman suddenly thought of Yang Kai and asked.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Luo Hai intently, all of them seemingly very interested in Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Luo Hai smiled slightly and said, “He’s still alive, this King can feel his vitality.”</p>
<p>“Still alive?!” The old woman was overjoyed, “Amazing! This old lady was worried his luck would turn bad and he would be killed by someone. It seems that his luck is better than this old lady expected. En, I look forward to the day when he emerges from the Blood Prison. This old lady wants to see if he has three heads and six arms.”</p>
<p>“He certainly doesn’t have three heads and six arms, he’s just unusually bold. He…” Luo Hai was speaking when suddenly he paused, a frown forming on his face which was soon replaced by a look of surprise.</p>
<p>“Sir Luo Hai, has that boy encountered some kind of terrible trouble?” Purple Star’s beautiful representative asked nervously.</p>
<p>No one wanted to see Yang Kai encounter trouble or fall inside the Blood Prison as they all regarded him as a potential rising star for them to recruit. All of these masters were just waiting for him to leave the Blood Prison so they could offer him extremely generous terms to win him over.</p>
<p>“He hasn’t encountered any trouble, but this King thinks he’s looking for some!” Luo Hai said in a strange tone.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” The old woman asked nervously.</p>
<p>“He’s actually travelling in the direction of the Domain Stone Mountain!” Luo Hai’s expression turned sour.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Everyone was shocked.</p>
<p>“Why would he go in the direction of Domain Stone Mountain?” The old woman ground her teeth in frustration. “This little brat is simply courting death! Is that a place he’s capable of going? If he were to be caught up in some kind of dispute…”</p>
<p>“En, this little boy really knows how to cause worry,” The beautiful woman from Purple Star sighed with a helpless expression.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was inside the Blood Prison, so they could not interfere, they could only watch as he tread into one dangerous situation after another.</p>
<p>Several of the Origin King Realm masters present wished they could break into the Blood Prison right now, fish out Yang Kai from there, and teach him a severe lesson.</p>
<p>“This is becoming more and more interesting; this little boy is truly bold.” Luo Hai smiled softly.</p>
<p>“Sir Luo Hai, please pay some attention to that little boy to see if he can…” The old woman asked anxiously.</p>
<p>“Of course. Although I can’t investigate too carefully, this King can still perceive whether that boy lives or dies. If there is any change in his status, this King will tell you,” Luo Hai nodded, not rejecting this simple request.</p>
<p>He too was quite interested in Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Then I shall trouble you with this, Sir Luo Hai.”</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>Inside the Blood Prison, there was a hill at a certain location.</p>
<p>Although it was a hill, it was really quite small.</p>
<p>No more than a hundred metres high and a hundred or so metres across, this entire hill was glowing with a peculiar lustre and a subtle Domain pulsed from it to fill its immediate surrounding.</p>
<p>Domain Stone Mountain! The treasure of the Blood Prison!</p>
<p>This hill was actually one, massive Domain Stone. No one knew how it was formed, but since it came into existence, it had become a permanent feature of the Blood Prison.</p>
<p>Shrouded by a terrifying Domain all year round, no one could approach it to get a glimpse of what Domain Stone Mountain truly looked like.</p>
<p>The Domain around Domain Stone Mountain was recognized as the most powerful Domain in the Blood Prison. No Origin Returning Realm master cultivator dared to challenge it as anyone who did would die without doubt.</p>
<p>Although it was constantly shrouded by a powerful Domain, there were times when this Domain would weaken somewhat and Domain Stone Mountain would be exposed.</p>
<p>There was no rule to this weakening, but in the past, when the Blood Prison opened, the Domain Stone Mountain had revealed itself only a handful of times. During those times, all Origin Returning Realm masters who heard the news were like cats smelling fish, gathering from all directions towards Domain Stone Mountain to look for a suitable location to experience the Domain emanating from Domain Stone Mountain.</p>
<p>This was far safer and more effective than trying to wade into Domain Vortices as the profound aura which pulsed from Domain Stone Mountain could be easily studied by cultivators to spy on the mysteries of Domain.</p>
<p>Some cultivators who had never had an opportunity to break through to the Origin King Realm were able to break through because they encountered the Domain Stone Mountain.</p>
<p>The old woman surnamed Lei from Sword Union was one such case.</p>
<p>For over ten thousand years, although Domain Stone Mountain had only appeared a couple of times, that did not dampen enthusiasm cultivators had towards it.</p>
<p>At this moment, over a hundred Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters had gathered around Domain Stone Mountain. These people came from all corners of the Star Field and were groups as small as three or four, to as big as seven or eight, each of them occupying different positions nearby.</p>
<p>These groups were all noticeably separated from each other.</p>
<p>Among these groups, the few with the largest number occupied the best positions and were currently releasing an imposing aura as they held their artifacts in their hands and stared around with cold eyes.</p>
<p>No one dared to provoke them, not only because of their large number but also because of their background.</p>
<p>The remaining groups, following their strength, also occupied different spots.</p>
<p>With nearly a hundred people, Domain Stone Mountain was almost entirely surrounded, and although there were still some open spaces, a steady stream of cultivators who had heard the news were still arriving.</p>
<p>It was conceivable that the open spaces would all eventually be occupied by cultivators.</p>
<p>The cultivators who came late and did not get a good position would often challenge weaker groups to seize their spots.</p>
<p>On one side of Domain Stone Mountain, in a spot that was neither good nor bad, three Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators gathered.</p>
<p>Among these three, two were familiar with Yang Kai, Qian Tong and the beautiful woman Lin Yu Rao from Star Emperor Mountain, while the last was someone Yang Kai had never met before.</p>
<p>At this moment, all three of them are silently condensing their Saint Qi, holding their most powerful artifacts, and observing their surroundings vigilantly.</p>
<p>These three had arrived here quite early, so the position they occupied wasn’t bad; however, as the number of cultivators who came here continued to increase, some people were already looking at them unkindly, seemingly considering whether they could drive them away.</p>
<p>If the three of them did not show enough deterrence, they would definitely not be able to keep this spot.</p>
<p>However, continuing to remain so vigilant was also not an appropriate solution. Domain Stone Mountain had already appeared and the larger, more powerful groups had begun to comprehend the mysteries of Domain from it while the three of them could only continue to delay, resulting in them not gaining anything.</p>
<p>The three of them understood this clearly, but they didn’t dare relax their vigilance, frustrating them greatly.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1599, Cannot be Judged by his Appearance</h2>
<p>“Elder Qian, have Elder Yang or Elder Mo responded?” Among the three, an elderly man wearing a brown robe looked around from time to time and continued to ask Qian Tong in a low voice.</p>
<p>“No,” Qian Tong slowly shook his head and replied anxiously, “I don’t know where they are, but the communication artifacts can’t reach them at all. What about Vice City Lord Ning? Have you been able to reach him yet?”</p>
<p>The elderly man sighed, “I can’t get in touch with him either. I don’t know where Brother Ning has gone.”</p>
<p>The two looked at each other and both saw the anxiety and helplessness in each other’s eyes.</p>
<p>The elderly man was Green Mountains Star’s Green Water City’s City Lord. When Yang Kai left Green Mountains Star and returned to Tong Xuan Realm, Qian Tong and his group of five stayed in the City Lord’s Mansion to prepare for the Blood Prison Trial, which would open a few years later.</p>
<p>The City Lord of Green Water City had an astute character, and after learning about Qian Tong and the others’ arrival, he had strongly invited them to serve as Honoured Guest Elders of Green Water City. Not wanting to cause any misunderstandings and in need of a good place to stay, Qian Tong and the others agreed.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, everyone had got along fairly well and there were no gaps or friction between them now.</p>
<p>As soon as the Blood Prison Trial started, they entered the Blood Prison with this elderly City Lord and Vice City Lord Ning.</p>
<p>All of them were Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters and entered the Blood Prison to comprehend the mysteries of Domain in order to touch upon the threshold of the Origin King Realm, so of course, it was impossible for all seven of them to travel together.</p>
<p>As such, everyone dispersed.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the elderly man heard about the appearance of the Domain Stone Mountain and immediately used his communication artifact to contact his companions, but only Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao had arrived so far while Yang Xiu Zhu, Chu Han Yi and Mo Yu from Clear Sky Sect were nowhere to be seen, nor was there any contact from Green Water City’s Vice City Lord Ning.</p>
<p>Seeing more and more people arrive here, Qian Tong and the others present naturally grew anxious.</p>
<p>Without an absolute advantage in strength and number, it would be impossible for them to keep the spot they currently occupied.</p>
<p>There was already a group of cultivators not far away who could not obtain a good position and were now eyeing them maliciously; however, because there were only two of them, they didn’t dare act rashly.</p>
<p>However, this pair was constantly sending their Divine Senses into their communication artifacts, seemingly contacting someone.</p>
<p>Once this pair’s reinforcements arrived, Qian Tong and their group’s situation would become precarious.</p>
<p>“Elder Lin, have you had any responses?” The elderly man turned his eyes to Lin Yu Rao next.</p>
<p>Lin Yu Rao slowly shook her head as a look of worry flashed across her beautiful eyes, “No.”</p>
<p>“What should we do?” The elderly man muttered anxiously and uneasily. Such a great opportunity lay in front of him but didn’t have the time or ability to take advantage of it, only able to stand in place vigilantly. This was nothing short of torturous.</p>
<p>“We’ll wait for another half a day, and after half a day. If Elder Yang and the others don’t come, we… we’ll leave!” The elderly man grit his teeth and decided.</p>
<p>Although the appearance of Domain Stone Mountain was a Heaven-sent opportunity, he did not want to lose his life here. The area around Domain Stone Mountain had been relatively calm so far, but it clearly would not be long before chaos ensued as many cultivators fought for better positions!</p>
<p>“To leave…” Qian Tong’s expression became cloudy and uncertain, filled with unwillingness.</p>
<p>Those from Shadowed Star, like him, had an incredible desire to spy on the mysteries of the Origin King Realm.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for Yang Kai bringing them away from Shadowed Star to this place, Qian Tong most likely never would have been able to shake off the World Principles shackles there his entire life, leaving him forever unable to seek higher levels of the Martial Dao.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had given him this chance, and now an incredible opportunity lay before him, so taking the initiative to leave it behind was naturally something Qian Tong was not reconciled to.</p>
<p>“Hm…” While in the throes of frustration, Qian Tong’s expression suddenly changed, and he poured his Divine Sense into his communication artifact once more.</p>
<p>“Did someone respond?” Green Water City’s City Lord asked Qian Tong joyfully when he saw this change in expression.</p>
<p>Lin Yu Rao’s beautiful eyes also glanced towards Qian Tong expectantly.</p>
<p>Qian Tong did not respond, however, as he was focused on the communication artifact. Only after some time did he laugh heartily, “Oh, someone has arrived.”</p>
<p>“Who is it? Elder Yang, Elder Chu, or Elder Mo?”</p>
<p>“None of them,” Qian Tong shook his head slowly.</p>
<p>“None of them? Could it be Brother Ning then?” Green Water City’s City Lord’s expression changed, nodding in approval. “Brother Ning is also good, his strength isn’t weak.”</p>
<p>“It’s not Brother Ning either.”</p>
<p>“Then who is it?” Green Water City’s City Lord was confused. Qian Tong and his party consisted of five people, two of whom were currently here while three were not. If none of them had responded, who had?</p>
<p>Lin Yu Rao also looked puzzled as she stared at Qian Tong curiously, not knowing what he meant.</p>
<p>Qian Tong chuckled, turned to Lin Yu Rao and said, “Yang Kai came!”</p>
<p>Lin Yu Rao’s beautiful eyes lit up as she asked with pleasant surprise, “Sect Master is here? Why is he here? Didn’t he return to his homeland?”</p>
<p>“I’m also confused,” Qian Tong smiled as a look of relief filled his face, “Perhaps he rushed back in time. When he left Green Mountains Star that year, didn’t he say that if there was enough time, he would return?”</p>
<p>“Elder Qian, are you certain? Are you sure the response you got was from Sect Master?”</p>
<p>“How could I be mistaken about such a thing?” Qian Tong shook his head repeatedly, “Although this old master is getting on in years, he hasn’t lost his faculties yet.”</p>
<p>“This is wonderful,” Lin Yu Rao nearly jumped for joy, “If Sect Master is here, things will be much easier.”</p>
<p>The two of them spoke in harmony, their words filled with admiration for Yang Kai. Although Green Water City’s City Lord did not know who this Yang Kai was, it was clear from Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao’s expressions that an amazing helper was on his way.</p>
<p>His nervous mood loosened, and he laughed, turning to Lin Yu Rao and saying, “Elder Lin, can you tell this City Lord a little bit about your Sect Master? This old master has never met him before and would prefer to not appear rude when he does.”</p>
<p>What Lin Yu Rao’s strength was, this elderly man knew very well. She was definitely stronger than himself.</p>
<p>Not only Lin Yu Rao, everyone from her group of five were far stronger than ordinary Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters! Their understanding of Shi was very profound, and their Saint Qi was extremely pure and dense.</p>
<p>At first, the elderly man didn’t quite understand why this was, but after associating with them for so long, he eventually learned that the Cultivation Star Qian Tong and the others came from had a kind of constraint which was related to its World Principles that prevented cultivators from breaking through to the Origin King Realm, forcing them to polish their Origin Returning Realm strength continuously.</p>
<p>It was for this reason that they had pushed their strength to the very peak of the Origin Returning Realm, surpassing the Origin Returning Realm masters of other Cultivation Stars.</p>
<p>Repeated tempering would lead to such results.</p>
<p>A man called Sect Master by a master like Lin Yu Rao should obviously be stronger than Lin Yu Rao, right? It was likely that this Yang Kai was already half a step into the Origin King Realm!</p>
<p>Green Water City’s City Lord took this as a given.</p>
<p>With the arrival of such a powerful helper, Green Water City’s City Lord was naturally overjoyed.</p>
<p>“How should I describe him…” Lin Yu Rao could not help showing a look of embarrassment on her face, seemingly finding it difficult to express herself clearly.</p>
<p>“Haha, I can’t tell you clearly, but after you meet him, Brother Zhao will understand,” Qian Tong smiled from the side, also feeling that any kind of explanation would be useless as Yang Kai couldn’t be described using common sense.</p>
<p>“En, very well!” The elderly man nodded lightly, not forcing the issue. In any case, he would soon be meeting this mysterious master, so there was not much point in asking about him now.</p>
<p>“However, Brother Zhao, this Qian will tell you in advance: Sect Master Yang cannot be judged by his appearance!” Qian Tong seemed to warn casually.</p>
<p>“Cannot be judged by his appearance?” Green Water City’s City Lord frowned slightly, wondering what Qian Tong meant.</p>
<p>“He’s here!” Qian Tong’s expression suddenly changed as he turned to look in a certain direction.</p>
<p>When the Green Water City’s City Lord heard this, he immediately refreshed his spirits and prepared to meet this powerful helper with full courtesy.</p>
<p>A figure flew over from that direction at extreme speed.</p>
<p>When Qian Tong first called out, this figure was still far away, a mere black spot that could barely be seen, but after three breaths, a brave and heroic youth appeared in front of Domain Stone Mountain.</p>
<p>“Yang Kai, over here!” Qian Tong shouted.</p>
<p>Around Domain Stone Mountain, countless cultivators glared at him.</p>
<p>Qian Tong could not help laughing awkwardly, realizing that he had acted a bit too eye-catching in his exuberance and quickly became low-key.</p>
<p>Yang Kai, who rushed to this place, first glanced at the huge Domain Stone Mountain, surprise flashing across his eyes as he did, before he turned and flew down to the spot where Qian Tong and the others were gathered and greeted them enthusiastically, “Elder Qian, Elder Lin!”</p>
<p>“Greetings, Sect Master!” Lin Yu Rao hurriedly saluted.</p>
<p>Yang Kai waved his hand, signaling for her to not be so polite, before asking in curiously, “Why are you two here? Where are the others?”</p>
<p>“We can’t contact them, so we don’t know where they are right now,” Qian Tong smiled helplessly. “Have you returned from your homeland?”</p>
<p>“En,” Yang Kai nodded.</p>
<p>“Just in time, just in time. I was worried that you wouldn’t make it for this Blood Prison Trial,” Qian Tong laughed.</p>
<p>“It was just a stroke of luck,” Yang Kai replied casually, not explaining anything.</p>
<p>It was indeed a lucky break for him to have made it here. He had gone to Monster Emperor Star to meet Shan Qing Luo but somehow wound up coming to the Blood Prison from there.</p>
<p>After exchanging greetings, Yang Kai turned to the unfamiliar elderly man and asked, “This is…”</p>
<p>“Oh, I forgot to introduce you. This is Green Water City’s City Lord Zhao Tian Ze. Brother Zhao, this is the Yang Kai I told you about.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze stared at Yang Kai blankly, his expression extremely weird.</p>
<p>Since Yang Kai appeared, Zhao Tian Ze had been examining him.</p>
<p>After all, from the previous conversation between Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao that praised Yang Kai’s strength and status, Zhao Tian Ze’s expectations of him had been set quite high.</p>
<p>He had expected a peak Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master!</p>
<p>He thought that the help who was coming would be stronger than Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao.</p>
<p>But as soon as they met, Zhao Tian Ze discovered that something was wrong.</p>
<p>The one who had come was a seemingly young man, which in and of itself was not a problem, but the aura fluctuations coming from this boy actually indicated that he was only a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator!</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze almost thought he had made a mistake and kept examining Yang Kai with his Divine Sense, but after three times, he was certain this boy really was just a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator…</p>
<p>Realizing this, Zhao Tian Ze nearly coughed up blood.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1600, You Can Rest Easy</h2>
<p>The greater the expectations, the greater the disappointment.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhao Tian Ze finally understood why Qian Tong had said before that seeing he was someone who cannot be judged by his appearance, he was clearly referring to this!</p>
<p>However, what could a mere Second-Order Origin Returning Realm boy do? Even if he could fight others above his realm, he couldn’t change their current situation. His arrival wouldn’t help them at all! At most, he could barely be considered another helper.</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze’s mood suddenly deflated.</p>
<p>But at any rate, he was a City Lord, and he had a good relationship with Qian Tong, Lin Yu Rao, and the others, so he wouldn’t allow his disappointment to show through too obviously. With a forced smile on his face, he cupped his fists and said, “This Zhao greets Sect Master Yang, Sect Master Yang… en, is a young and promising man.”</p>
<p>The insincerity of this compliment was apparent to everyone.</p>
<p>Yang Kai replied politely as well, not taking any offence. Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao looked at each other and also didn’t bother to explain.</p>
<p>They clearly knew how powerful Yang Kai was. It could be said that Yang Kai being here was the same as having a peak Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master to assist them! This gave them enough confidence to remain here.</p>
<p>“Hah, it’s just a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm brat!”</p>
<p>“This boy actually managed to survive inside the Blood Prison for so long, his luck must be quite good.”</p>
<p>“However, his luck has just run out, I’ll bet he won’t survive the day.”</p>
<p>“Hmph, an ignorant boy who doesn’t know how to spell ‘death’, actually daring to come to Domain Stone Mountain!”</p>
<p>“This little brat must be an idiot. His arrival not only doesn’t help his companions but actually adds a weakness instead, they’re finished.”</p>
<p>Whispers suddenly sounded all around as countless cultivators focused their attention on Yang Kai, most of them wearing disdainful or mocking expressions while some just felt it strange.</p>
<p>Around Domain Stone Mountain, there were more than a hundred Origin Returning Realm masters, all of them at the Third-Orders.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was the only Second-Order present, making him stand out like a crane amongst chickens, so he became the topic of everyone’s attention and discussion.</p>
<p>Yang Kai remained perfectly calm, not caring about everyone else discussing him at all. Zhao Tian Ze’s expression, however, became more and more uneasy.</p>
<p>Originally, with just him, Qian Tong, and Lin Yu Rao here, even if some people were eyeing them with ill intent, they still had enough strength to maintain the status quo for a while, but the moment Yang Kai showed up, their location immediately became the focus of attention. Divine Senses swept toward them constantly as strong auras began pressuring them, causing Zhao Tian Ze to grow nervous.</p>
<p>The arrival of this young man named Yang Kai seemed to have made their situation more difficult.</p>
<p>Glancing around at their surroundings, Zhao Tian Ze began leaking sweat from his forehead.</p>
<p>“Yang Kai, those two over there have been eyeing us for a while now,” Qian Tong moved to Yang Kai’s side and whispered, gesturing towards a nearby spot as he spoke.</p>
<p>Following his gaze, Yang Kai quickly noticed two Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators who were constantly observing them. Seeing Yang Kai’s gaze, one of these two stared back and grinned maliciously.</p>
<p>The other person, holding a communication artifact in his hand, was still communicating with someone.</p>
<p>“I see,” Yang Kai nodded slightly, a trace of suspicion flashing across his face.</p>
<p>He vaguely felt that the robes worn by these two people were familiar, as if he had seen them somewhere before.</p>
<p>However, he had been living on Shadowed Star almost the entire time he had been in the Star Field and had rarely interacted with cultivators from other Cultivation Stars, so he couldn’t recall where he had seen such uniforms before.</p>
<p>[Was it in the Emperor Garden?] Yang Kai thought to himself as the Emperor Garden was the only place where he had frequently dealt with cultivators from other Cultivation Stars.</p>
<p>“By the way, what is this place and what is that huge Domain Stone? How come so many people have gathered here?” Yang Kai withdrew his gaze and asked the questions which had been bothering him since he arrived.</p>
<p>He had hurried over to this place after receiving a message from Qian Tong, but he still knew nothing about Domain Stone Mountain.</p>
<p>“This is Domain Stone Mountain,” Qian Tong replied, “We only know that this thing has always existed inside the Blood Prison, as for the specifics, you’d best ask Brother Zhao instead, he knows much more about it.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll have to bother City Lord Zhao,” Yang Kai cupped his fists and bowed to Zhao Tian Ze.</p>
<p>“Sect Master Yang is too polite,” Zhao Tian Ze laughed dryly. Although he was still a little uneasy, it wasn’t a problem to explain about Domain Stone Mountain to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Hearing what he said, Yang Kai suddenly became interested.</p>
<p>“So, the chances of Domain Stone Mountain appearing are very small?”</p>
<p>“Naturally, it has only appeared a handful of times when the Blood Prison Trial has opened in the past. Normally, it is surrounded by a terrifying Domain, making it impossible to approach,” Zhao Tian Ze nodded.</p>
<p>“And no one has ever thought of trying to take it away?” Yang Kai stared at the huge Domain Stone with scorching eyes.</p>
<p>Even Origin Kings would go all out to acquire such a large piece of Domain Stone, right? As long as they placed it in their Sect, it would become a core treasure that could produce many Origin Kings!</p>
<p>The gentle Domain aura it exuded was an incredible cultivation treasure.</p>
<p>“Sect Master Yang surely jests.” Zhao Tian Ze said as the corner of his brow twitched, “Without even mentioning how heavy this Domain Stone is, making it impossible to move, even if someone had the strength to carry it off, none would dare touch it arbitrarily.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” Yang Kai was startled.</p>
<p>“If one triggered a powerful wave of Domain, who could possibly resist?” Zhao Tian Ze spoke solemnly as he stared at Yang Kai with a strange expression.</p>
<p>He wanted to scold Yang Kai for asking such an ignorant question, but was too embarrassed to actually speak such words.</p>
<p>“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai gently nodded, finally understanding the peculiarities of this Domain Stone Mountain. Staring at it earnestly for a moment, Yang Kai suddenly grinned, “But this is indeed a Heaven-sent opportunity! Since we’re here and occupy a good place, let’s not waste any time. We need to hurry up and cultivate, there are already many doing so apparently.”</p>
<p>“Uh, relying on just the few of us?” Zhao Tian Ze was astonished.</p>
<p>“Are we waiting for someone else?”</p>
<p>“We’re not expecting anyone else, but with so few of us, if we were all to sit in meditation and were suddenly sneak attacked while we were in the midst of some critical comprehension, the consequences would be disastrous…” Zhao Tian Ze worried, pointing to the group with the largest number of people in the distance, “Sect Master Yang, look over there. There are many of them so they can separate into two different groups, one to stand guard while the other meditates, but with just the four of us…”</p>
<p>“I’ll stand guard then, the three of you meditate,” Yang Kai said freely.</p>
<p>“This…” Zhao Tian Ze was stunned and showed a trace of gratitude. Although he was a little disappointed with Yang Kai’s arrival, Yang Kai offering to stand guard for them while they benefited was still a touching gesture.</p>
<p>Regardless of his strength, this young man had an upstanding character.</p>
<p>“Sect Master, I can stand guard,” Lin Yu Rao took the initiative to ask.</p>
<p>“No need, since I’ve said you can cultivate, just cultivate. Don’t waste time,” Yang Kai waved his hand and urged. “The earlier you begin, the more benefits you will get!”</p>
<p>“Alright,” Qian Tong pondered for a moment before nodding, “Since that’s your decision Yang Kai, we’ll go along with it. Also, we won’t sink completely into a meditative state, if there is any movement, we will be able to react immediately. When I’ve reached a good point to stop my comprehension, I’ll change places with you.”</p>
<p>“En.”</p>
<p>Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao exchanged a glance before sitting down cross-legged.</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze hesitated, however, and quickly approached Qian Tong to ask in a low voice, “Elder Qian, can we really do this?”</p>
<p>He did not feel assured leaving his safety in Yang Kai’s hands. He would rather Qian Tong or Lin Yu Rao stand guard as that would at least put him more at ease.</p>
<p>“When Yang Kai acts, you can rest at ease,” Qian Tong stretched out his hand and patted him on the shoulder, speaking seriously.</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze smiled bitterly. He really didn’t know why Qian Tong had so much confidence in Yang Kai, but seeing both him and Lin Yu Rao close their eyes to seek enlightenment, he too couldn’t help giving in to the temptation of Domain Stone Mountain, grit his teeth, and sat down cross-legged to meditate.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t dare to fully immerse himself in his comprehension, making sure he could still react to any sudden changes around him.</p>
<p>Seeing that all three of them had entered a state of comprehension, Yang Kai sat down cross-legged as well and observed Domain Stone Mountain with interest.</p>
<p>Earlier, he couldn’t have imagined that there was such a large piece of Domain Stone in the Blood Prison. He had entered several dozen Domain Vortices already but only managed to obtain four Domain Stones, all of which were only the size of a fist, and one of them he had given to Xue Sun.</p>
<p>If such a large piece of Domain Stone could be taken away…</p>
<p>Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling excited, his eyes sparkling as he grinned deviously.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to put his plan into action, however, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly changed and he turned his head to the side.</p>
<p>From a certain direction, a group of four people were flying over towards their position, and after a short while, these four people landed nearby, and paused to stare at Domain Stone Mountain with scorching eyes and looks of joy on their faces.</p>
<p>The appearance of Domain Stone Mountain was a rare opportunity for any cultivator!</p>
<p>“You’ve finally arrived!” Someone greeted these four while also complaining slightly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai looked over and found that this man was the one who had been eyeing him maliciously earlier. He and his other companion had been in contact with someone while paying attention to Qian Tong and the others since before Yang Kai arrived.</p>
<p>It seemed that these four who had just arrived were the ones this man’s companion had contacted before.</p>
<p>“We had some trouble on the road thanks to an enchantress!” The leading man replied in a deep voice.</p>
<p>“An enchantress?” The questioner’s brow rose.</p>
<p>“En, I don’t know where she’s from, but she was incredibly strong. If it weren’t for there being four of us, I’m afraid we wouldn’t have been able to repel her. Fortunately, with all of us working together, we managed to wound her, but unfortunately, she managed to escape after that,” The leading man replied angrily.</p>
<p>“That enchantress was so beautiful, Brother Cai. You didn’t see her, but if you did, I’m afraid you’d have trouble even walking straight,” Someone else from the newcomers commented.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you exaggerating a bit too much?” The man surnamed Cai curled his lips, obviously not believing them.</p>
<p>“It’s no exaggeration. That enchantress was definitely the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen in my life, but the aura she gave off was a bit strange. She seemed to have Monster Qi and Saint Qi mixed together.”</p>
<p>“Forget it, don’t mention that enchantress anymore,” The leading man waved his hand and interrupted the chatter, “Brother Cai Feng, what’s the situation here?”</p>
<p>“Nothing serious,” Cai Feng shrugged, “You should be able to see that there’s only so much space around this Domain Stone Mountain. The innermost section has already been occupied by those who got here first, but in the outer region, there are still a few good spots.”</p>
<h2>Chapter 1601, This Place Is Off Limits</h2>
<p>Hearing what he said, the lead man frowned and said in a displeased tone, “I don’t want to be too far away from Domain Stone Mountain. What kind of benefits can we gain if we’re too far? We need to secure a position in the innermost layer.”</p>
<p>“Then we’ll need to snatch one!” Cai Feng grinned.</p>
<p>“Do you have a target in mind?”</p>
<p>“I do,” Cai Feng nodded as he glanced over at the location of Yang Kai and his group and laughed lowly, “Their spot looks good.”</p>
<p>The lead man glanced over towards where Yang Kai was sitting and showed a satisfied expression, nodding as he said, “That spot is indeed good, it’s settled then.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem like they’ll give it up willingly though,” Cai Feng chuckled as he had been noticing Yang Kai observing them. Sending a cold glare towards Yang Kai, Cai Feng snorted, “That little brat seems to have been paying attention to us.”</p>
<p>“Since we’ve settled on their spot, they have no choice but to give way. It doesn’t matter if they agree or not!” The lead man declared before meeting Yang Kai’s gaze unhesitatingly and striding forward.</p>
<p>The other five people in this group followed closely behind, making no qualms about their intentions as they wantonly released their auras.</p>
<p>A moment later, this group of six stopped a hundred metres away from Yang Kai and the lead man arrogantly spat, “Boy, where are you from?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai grinned and replied lightly, “Shadowed Star.”</p>
<p>“Shadowed Star?” The leading man frowned for a moment before curling his lips and saying, “Never heard of it. This King has taken a fancy to your place, leave now or don’t blame us for being impolite.”</p>
<p>Continuing to sit on the ground, Yang Kai picked some wax from his ear indifferently before blowing it towards this aggressive group and declaring lightly, “Sorry, I didn’t hear what you said, can you say it again?”</p>
<p>The leading man sneered, “Boy, you should learn to appreciate kindness. This King doubts you’re deaf. This King won’t repeat himself; you should scram now if you don’t want to die!”</p>
<p>The five people behind him grinned mockingly as they released a threatening aura.</p>
<p>“What is this? If you have something to say we can discuss it in a civilized manner, why immediately resort to threats?” Zhao Tian Ze stood up with a helpless expression.</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai had said he would stand guard and allow him and the others to comprehend the mysteries of Domain from Domain Stone Mountain, how could Zhao Tian Ze rest assured leaving his life in Yang Kai’s hands? No matter how much Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao trusted this boy, to Zhao Tian Ze, Yang Kai was still just a stranger.</p>
<p>What’s more, this boy was just a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator! So Zhao Tian Ze had not dared to immerse himself in meditation and naturally immediately noticed this commotion, swiftly jumping out to mediate the situation.</p>
<p>“This one is Green Mountains Star Green Water City’s City Lord, Zhao Tian Ze. Greetings several friends, may I have your honoured names?” Zhao Tian Ze said with a hollow laugh as he bowed in a submissive posture.</p>
<p>The lead man on the opposite side looked at Zhao Tian Ze, completely ignoring Yang Kai as he felt that Zhao Tian Ze was the one truly in charge here. As for Yang Kai with his weak cultivation, this man figured he was just following orders. With a relaxed and confident expression, the lead man said, “This King is Scarlet Wave Star Brilliant Flame Sect’s Zhang Qing, these are my fellow brothers from Scarlet Wave Star!”</p>
<p>“Scarlet Wave Star? Brilliant Flame Sect?” Yang Kai raised his brow slightly, finally understanding why this group’s robes seemed familiar to him.</p>
<p>When he had met Xu Ding Yang, who was killed by the first Domain Vortex Yang Kai came across, the former said he had come from Scarlet Wave Star. At that time, Yang Kai had felt a vague sense of familiarity with this Cultivation Star’s name.</p>
<p>Now hearing this Zhang Qing’s introduction, Yang Kai immediately understood.</p>
<p>In the Emperor Garden, he had met several cultivators from Scarlet Wave Star.</p>
<p>Specifically, he had met two groups of people.</p>
<p>One group was from Brilliant Flame Sect while the other was from Ice Heart Valley. These two groups were fighting over possession of an ancient secluded home that Yang Kai happened to pass by on accident.</p>
<p>At that time, through a series of twists and turns, Yang Kai had gotten himself involved in this dispute and ended up assisting the women from Ice Heart Valley to kill the cultivators from Brilliant Flame Sect.</p>
<p>The True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture and the Purple Origin Furnace were both treasures Yang Kai had obtained from that ancient secluded home.</p>
<p>[No wonder this Cai Feng’s uniform is so familiar, turns out I’ve dealt with his Sect before!] Yang Kai grinned, a slightly playful light flashing across his eyes.</p>
<p>“So several friends are from Brilliant Flame Sect!” Zhao Tian Ze’s face changed slightly and he quickly bowed deeper, “Please pardon my disrespect.”</p>
<p>He had obviously heard the name ‘Brilliant Flame Sect’.</p>
<p>Zhang Qing’s expression grew smugger and he nodded lightly, “Since Friend has heard of my Brilliant Flame Sect, this matter can be settled easily. Tell your partners to clean up and give way. This King won’t be unreasonable, as long as you withdraw, this King can guarantee he won’t harm you.”</p>
<p>“This…” Zhao Tian Ze wore a bitter look and hesitated before saying, “Brother Zhang, forgive me, but I can’t decide this matter alone, please let this Zhao discuss it with his companions.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to discuss, this place is off-limits. Find yourselves another one,” Lin Yu Rao’s soft voice sounded.</p>
<p>She and Qian Tong were well aware of what was happening and had been staring over with cold eyes for some time, but when Zhao Tian Ze seemed to be caving to outside pressure, they naturally couldn’t remain silent.</p>
<p>She shared Qian Tong’s deep yearning towards the Origin King Realm!</p>
<p>“Don’t you think you’re going too far here?” Qian Tong’s complexion also sank as he glared at Zhang Qing and his group.</p>
<p>“Going too far?” Zhang Qing sneered, “This King is doing no such thing. This King has given you a way out, but it is up to you whether you can grasp it or not.”</p>
<p>“If you dare talk back again, we’ll just kill you all!” Cai Feng shouted, his expression becoming impatient.</p>
<p>“Everyone, calm down, calm down,” Zhao Tian Ze called out anxiously as he motioned to Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao not to speak before turning to Zhang Qing. “Brother Zhang, please wait a moment, I will explain this matter to them and give you a prompt reply!”</p>
<p>“Fine! Since this is your home star, this King will give you some face, but you do not have much time, I want an answer within half a cup of tea’s time!” Zhang Qing reminded him coldly.</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze bitterly nodded before quickly approaching Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao and helplessly said, “Friends, do you really refuse to compromise?”</p>
<p>Qian Tong looked at him faintly, “What’s wrong, does Brother Zhao want to withdraw?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze slowly shook his head, “If it were possible, how could I be willing to just back down? However, they outnumber us greatly and if we don’t agree to their demands, the end result will not be good.”</p>
<p>Qian Tong frowned slightly before asking in a somewhat surprised tone, “Brother Zhao’s courage isn’t this small, right? Regardless of anything else, you are also a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator who has weathered many great storms before, yes? Is it this Brilliant Flame Sect that you dread? What kind of background do they have to make you so fearful?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze’s face twitched slightly as he showed a bitter smile, “Elder Qian noticed? Yes, to be honest, I do fear their background somewhat. Brilliant Flame Sect is based on Scarlet Wave Star so it is reasonable to say that as a native of Green Mountains Star, there is no need to be wary of them; however, their Supreme Elder seems to have a close relationship with the Star Master of Green Mountains Star! We can’t afford to offend this group of people!”</p>
<p>“The Star Master of Green Mountains Star!” Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao both narrowed their eyes.</p>
<p>After living on Green Mountains Star for three years now, they naturally knew that there was a powerful Star Master here, one at the Second-Order Origin King Realm.</p>
<p>“If I explain until here, do you two understand?” Zhao Tian Ze looked at them worriedly.</p>
<p>“I understand, but whether we give way or not will be up to Sect Master. If Sect Master chooses to withdraw I will withdraw, if Sect Master tells me to remain, I will remain!” Lin Yu Rao raised her eyes to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Up to him…” Zhao Tian Ze’s face sank, never having expected that the final decision would still rest in Yang Kai’s hands.</p>
<p>“Yang Kai, you decide whether we should stay or go!” Qian Tong also looked over, “This old master will follow your lead!”</p>
<p>“Why should we withdraw?” Yang Kai curled his lips, “Naturally we’re staying, how could we miss such a good opportunity? As for those people… rest assured, if they want to court death, I’ll grant their request!”</p>
<p>“If you say so, this old master can rest assured,” Qian Tong grinned fiercely while Lin Yu Rao also flashed an excited look.</p>
<p>“You…” Zhao Tian Ze was truly speechless as he stared at Yang Kai in a daze. “Have you not figured out our situation? If you want to court death, why bother pulling Elder Qian and Elder Lin down with you? They put their lives in your hands so you are responsible for their wellbeing. If you boast so shamelessly, in the end you’ll be the one to suffer.”</p>
<p>Obviously, he had become a little angry and no longer spoke politely to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“If City Lord Zhao does not wish to remain, you can leave by yourself,” Yang Kai looked at him lightly, “I’m not forcing you to remain and share life and death with us!”</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze became enraged and pointed at Yang Kai viciously but was unable to say a word.</p>
<p>Zhang Qing and his group naturally saw this scene and couldn’t help laughing.</p>
<p>They suddenly felt that these four were quite interesting. A disaster was looming over them but not only could they not show unity, they instead had a falling out, truly the height of ignorance and stupidity.</p>
<p>“This old master won’t bother arguing with you!” Zhao Tian Ze was thoroughly irritated with Yang Kai and quickly turned to Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao and said, “Friends, leave this place with me, otherwise they will definitely not be polite.”</p>
<p>Qian Tong, however, just sighed, “Brother Zhao, we have worked together for several years so this Qian understands your character. This Qian understands that you are doing what you believe is for the best, but there is no need. You leave first!”</p>
<p>Lin Yu Rao pursed her lips and smiled, “You shouldn’t leave too far though, perhaps you’ll be back soon.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze was stunned.</p>
<p>He naturally understood the meaning of Lin Yu Rao’s words, but he simply couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>Shooting a cold glare at Yang Kai, Zhao Tian Ze sighed, “I don’t know why Elder Qian and Elder Lin are so confident in you, but I hope you know what you are doing.”</p>
<p>After leaving these last words, he flew outwards.</p>
<p>He had given it his best effort but Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao were unwilling to listen to his advice, so he had no other choice.</p>
<p>He didn’t have the confidence to remain and help Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao against this enemy, so he could only choose to leave in low spirits.</p>
<p>Zhang Qing and others looked at him coldly. Without him needing to explain, they already knew the result.</p>
<p>Sure enough, they didn’t try to embarrass Zhao Tian Ze and instead just directed their attention towards Yang Kai’s group of three.</p>
<p>“It looks like you won’t regret it unless you see your coffin?” Zhang Qing sneered, his eyes flashing a cold, sharp light, “Don’t blame this King for not giving you a chance, you brought this on yourselves.”</p>
<p>Saying so, an extremely potent Shi suddenly spread from his body and swiftly engulfed Yang Kai’s group!</p>
<h2>Chapter 1602, Kill Him</h2>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain &amp; Dhael Ligerkeys</p>
<p>Beside Domain Stone Mountain, Brilliant Flame Sect’s Zhang Qing wore a fierce look as he released his Shi to envelop Yang Kai’s group of three.</p>
<p>His Shi seemed to be mixed with a special force that made anyone who fell into it feel as if they had been thrown into a volcanic crater. The ambient heat was astonishing and seemed capable of roasting everyone it touched.</p>
<p>Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao’s faces changed slightly and they quickly released their own Shi to resist.</p>
<p>Yang Kai simply raised his brow and showed a look of interest, however.</p>
<p>This Zhang Qing really had enough capital to back up his arrogance. Obviously, his Shi had reached the minor accomplishment stage!</p>
<p>Shi was a special power that as long as one reached the Origin Returning Realm they could condense. After that, as one’s cultivation increased, the power of their Shi would also grow stronger.</p>
<p>However, if one wanted to cultivate their Shi to the minor accomplishment stage, they needed to integrate their own unique energies into it to strengthen it further.</p>
<p>For example, Yang Kai had integrated his Space Force into his Shi!</p>
<p>As for this Zhang Qing, he had accomplished a similar feat by integrating his understanding of the Flame Attribute into his Shi.</p>
<p>Among all Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters, only about twenty percent of cultivators could accomplish this, and Zhang Qing was undoubtedly one such cultivator.</p>
<p>Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao had also made similar achievements in Shi, so they had no trouble resisting the oppression of Zhang Qing’s Shi. This was the fundamental reason why Zhao Tian Ze was not as strong as Qian Tong and the others.</p>
<p>In front of Yang Kai’s group of three, there seemed to be an invisible barrier that was blocking Zhang Qing’s Shi from advancing any further.</p>
<p>Zhang Qing couldn’t help showing a look of shock at this sight.</p>
<p>If it was just Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao who could resist his Shi, he would still be able to accept it; after all, these two had reached the Third-Order Origin realm like him, but what was going on with this boy? Obviously, he was just a Second-Order so why was his Shi also at the minor accomplishment stage? In fact, this boy seemed to have an even easier time resisting his Shi than the two behind him.</p>
<p>This boy was treating his Shi as if it were a light breeze, completely unworthy of attention!</p>
<p>Zhang Qing stared at Yang Kai in amazement as shock filled his heart.</p>
<p>“Minor accomplishment stage Shi!” Yang Kai nodded lightly, a playful smile on his face, “Not bad!”</p>
<p>As he said so, he glanced around casually. Since Zhang Qing and his group approached them, there had been countless eyes looking towards this place, seemingly waiting for a battle to begin. Many of them had sharp eyes and unreadable expressions, as if they were plotting something and just waiting for an opportunity to act.</p>
<p>Yang Kai naturally didn’t miss these hidden intentions and knew that if he didn’t put on a strong enough display this time, even if he could force Zhang Qing’s group to retreat, others would come to provoke them afterwards, creating an endless cycle.</p>
<p>After all, their group having so few people was an obvious weakness.</p>
<p>Sneering to himself, Yang Kai lifted his hand, pointed to a cultivator behind Zhang Qing, and asked, “I heard you say just now that you met an enchantress on the way here, right?”</p>
<p>This cultivator was startled, wondering why Yang Kai was suddenly asking about this, but with a cold expression he replied in a deep voice, “So what?”</p>
<p>“Was that enchantress wearing a red dress?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“Did you wound her?” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, a dangerous light flashing across her eyes.</p>
<p>“You’re wrong! It was I who managed to wound her, but unfortunately, it was just a single palm so I couldn’t take her life!” The cultivator sneered.</p>
<p>“Very well!” Yang Kai nodded, his figure flickering in the next instant and without any prior signs of moving, disappeared completely.</p>
<p>Although this happened suddenly, Zhang Qing and his group still reacted swiftly. Which master that had cultivated to the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm had not experienced countless life or death battles? Hurriedly, their eyes widened as they searched for Yang Kai.</p>
<p>However, there was nothing to find! There was absolutely no trace of Yang Kai anywhere around them.</p>
<p>The next instant though, Yang Kai’s figure appeared in the middle of Zhang Qing and his group like a ghost. With a cold expression, he reached out his hand and grabbed towards the head of the cultivator who had spoken just now.</p>
<p>“Watch out!” Someone nearby shouted.</p>
<p>The cultivator was furious and was about to strike back, but Yang Kai had already clasped his hand around this man’s head and released a burst of Saint Qi into his body. This Saint Qi smashed through this unfortunate man’s defences like they were wet paper and sank into his five viscera and six organs before Yang Kai swung his arm violently.</p>
<p>The man was tossed out by Yang Kai with great force.</p>
<p>As this man flew through the air, he let out a terrible howl, as if he was suffering the most cruel and inhuman torture. A moment later, the man hit the ground with a thud and his body suddenly burst apart.</p>
<p>Blood and hashed meat flew everywhere as a rich smell of iron rose to the sky!</p>
<p>“I should have mentioned this first, that enchantress is my woman!” Yang Kai declared fiercely.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>Looking over at the blood and flesh which was raining down from the sky, everyone suddenly felt they had stumbled into a tiger’s den and stared at Yang Kai fearfully, many even forgetting to breathe at this moment.</p>
<p>With one blow, this boy had instantly killed a Third-Order Origin Realm cultivator. No Third-Order Origin Realm cultivator should be able to do this.</p>
<p>Only an Origin King should be capable of such a feat!</p>
<p>However, the one who was responsible for this astonishing display was clearly just a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, a boy who should be the weakest cultivator present!</p>
<p>The gap between this boy’s cultivation realm and the intense visual he had just created had formed an extremely sharp psychological contrast, stunning everyone silent.</p>
<p>Those who had been secretly eyeing Yang Kai and his group before now couldn’t help breaking out into cold sweat, secretly rejoicing that they hadn’t been the first to challenge them otherwise they might have been the ones who ended up in such a miserable state.</p>
<p>“Boy, you dare!” Zhang Qing finally reacted, roared, and threw a rage filled punch towards Yang Kai as he pressed his burning Shi towards him.</p>
<p>Zhang Qing’s fist seemed to burn so hotly that the surrounding space distorted as his punch passed through it, his flame-like attack rushing straight towards Yang Kai’s head.</p>
<p>The moment Zhang Qing took action, his companions also summoned their artifacts and pushed their Saint Qi into them, causing them to light up in a dazzling display of light.</p>
<p>At that moment though, an extraordinary Shi suddenly broke through Zhang Qing’s Shi and suppressed all of them in place.</p>
<p>In an instant, Zhang Qing’s entire group found their Shi fiercely suppressed, to the point where they couldn’t even release it outside their bodies.</p>
<p>Not only that, the space around them solidified greatly, making it difficult for them to even walk while at the same time, the circulation of their Saint Qi inside their bodies was noticeably impeded, causing the brilliance of their artifacts to rapidly dim.</p>
<p>Shi suppression!</p>
<p>They knew better than anyone what the reason was. They had been trapped inside Yang Kai’s Shi, unable to free themselves. They had used this method when dealing with enemies with lower cultivation than themselves many times before as it was extremely effective.</p>
<p>However, now they were the ones being suppressed by someone at a lower cultivation.</p>
<p>If they weren’t personally experiencing it, they would likely have never believed it possible, but their current reality was undeniable!</p>
<p>Their faces pulled taught and their muscles bulged as they desperately pushed their Saint Qi, trying to get rid of Yang Kai’s suppression.</p>
<p>Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao did not give them a chance to breathe though.</p>
<p>Qian Tong roared and summoned a coin-like artifact to his hand, one that exuded a dazzling golden light and had a distinct hole in its centre. As soon as it appeared, Qian Tong tossed it into the air where it split into two, then four, then eight…</p>
<p>In an instant, the sky was filled with golden coins with and at their empty centres a sharp, bolt-like attack formed and shot out towards the enemy in a terrifying barrage.</p>
<p>Lin Yu Rao figure flickered as a coloured ribbon appeared in her hand and lashed towards the frozen Brilliant Flame Sect cultivators, wrapping around one of them and rapidly constricting to the point where the sound of broken bones rang out and blood spewed from his mouth.</p>
<p>By the time the coloured ribbon flew back to Lin Yu Rao’s hands, the enemy she had targeted was already lying limply on the ground, barely alive.</p>
<p>Yang Kai laughed wildly and didn’t pay any attention to any enemies except Zhang Qing. The others could be dealt with by Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao. Neither of them was weaker than Zhang Qing, so when they joined forces, dealing with four enemies who were suppressed by Yang Kai’s Shi wouldn’t be any trouble.</p>
<p>Yang Kai on the other hand was splitting his attention to combat Zhang Qing’s Shi with his own while at the same time sending out a silent order.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the high-pitched cry, the Firebird Artifact Spirit soared out from Yang Kai’s body.</p>
<p>“Kill him!” Yang Kai shouted as he charged towards Zhang Qing. At the same time, the Firebird Artifact Spirit flapped its wings and crashed down like a meteor from Nine Heavens, opening its giant mouth and constantly spitting out scorching hot fireballs towards Zhang Qing’s head.</p>
<p>Zhang Qing’s complexion changed drastically. He hadn’t expected the situation to become like this at all. The miserable screams of his companions filling his ears sent shivers up his spine as he struggled to deal with Yang Kai and the Firebird Artifact Spirit’s joint assault.</p>
<p>In less than three breaths, Zhang Qing was pierced through his lower abdomen by Yang Kai’s Heaven Punishing Spear while the Firebird took advantage of this opening to land a fireball on his forehead.</p>
<p>Zhang Qing’s hair singed, leaving him incredibly dishevelled. Gritting his teeth Zhang Qing glared at Yang Kai with pure hatred as he suddenly released a terrifying aura. At the same time, a sharp sound of thunder rang out as flashes of lightning streaked across his figure.</p>
<p>A golden light suddenly appeared at that moment as Yang Kai sent out a Golden Blood Thread from his fingers that captured Zhang Qing after catching him off guard.</p>
<p>Looking at him mockingly, Yang Kai smiled and said in a low voice, “Do you think I don’t know about your Heaven Scorching Thunder Fire? Did you want to use this Secret Technique to drag me down with me?”</p>
<p>“How did you know?” Zhang Qing’s face changed slightly.</p>
<p>“Because I killed a few of your Brilliant Flame Sect’s people in the Emperor Garden,” Yang Kai snickered before swiftly constricting the Golden Blood Thread that was binding Zhang Qing.</p>
<p><em>Snap</em></p>
<p>The extremely sharp Golden Blood Thread sliced through Zhang Qing Saint Qi’s defence and cut him into countless pieces, leaving a hashed up pile of meat scattered across the ground.</p>
<p>The battle thus ended…</p>
<p>From start to finish, only ten breaths had passed, causing many who were watching to still not catch up with what had happened.</p>
<p>The group of six headed by Brilliant Flame Sect’s Zhang Qing had been wiped out.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yang Kai and his group of three were unscathed.</p>
<p>The audience was thoroughly shocked!</p>
<p>All the cultivators present stared at Yang Kai as if he was some kind of monster, astonishment filling their gazes.</p>
<p>They had witnessed the entire course of this battle and naturally understood how important Yang Kai’s role in it was.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that he alone suppressed Zhang Qing’s entire group of six. If not for his Shi being so overpowering, Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao would not have been able to kill the enemy like they were chopping up melons and vegetables!</p>
<p>Among this group of six, besides Zhang Qing’s Shi, which he could only release slightly, the other five were unable to use their Shi at all as it was completely suppressed inside their bodies, unable to play any role.</p>
<p>Could an Origin Realm master who couldn’t use their Shi even be called an Origin Returning Realm master?</p>
<h2>Chapter 1603, In His Pocket</h2>
<p>It was as if Zhang Qing and his group weren’t facing a Second-Order Origin Realm cultivator, but a genuine Origin King…</p>
<p>Around Domain Stone Mountain, all eyes focused towards Yang Kai solemnly.</p>
<p>Everyone realized that this young man was an extremely terrifying opponent!</p>
<p>Many groups closer to Yang Kai retreated backwards, subconsciously distancing themselves from Yang Kai like they were trying to avoid a god of plague.</p>
<p>A mass of purple Thunder Fire floated above Zhang Qing’s corpse. This Thunder Fire not only contained scorching heat but also violent lightning. It was a kind of Secret Technique that Brilliant Flame Sect’s most powerful cultivators could cultivate.</p>
<p>Last time, in the Emperor Garden, the beautiful woman named Tan Ting He from Ice Heart Valley had told Yang Kai that Brilliant Flame Sect had a Heavenly Thunder Fire in their possession that served as the foundation of their Sect and contained astonishing power.</p>
<p>If a cultivator of Brilliant Flame Sect was strong enough, they could use the power of this Heavenly Thunder Fire to cultivate the Heaven Scorching Thunder Fire Secret Technique.</p>
<p>Obviously, Zhang Qing was one such qualified individual.</p>
<p>As soon as this mass of Heaven Scorching Thunder Fire belonging to Zhang Qing appeared, the Firebird Artifact Spirit swooped down as if it smelt a delicious delicacy and swallowed it whole before letting out a satisfied cry.</p>
<p>“Come back,” Yang Kai called out, and the Artifact Spirit immediately turned into a flame that flew into Yang Kai’s body and disappeared.</p>
<p>Turning his head and looking around, Yang Kai found that the crowd had yet to recover from their shock; however, many of them swiftly avoided his gaze when it swept past them, as if they were afraid to meet eyes with him.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai just chuckled and shouted loudly, “Rest assured, if others don’t provoke me, I won’t provoke them. I just want to occupy a little space here, as for everyone else, you can do whatever you want.”</p>
<p>Hearing what he said, the vigilant cultivators breathed a sigh of relief and their nervous expressions gradually eased.</p>
<p>With the overwhelming strength Yang Kai just displayed, things would definitely not end well if he were to focus on any of their groups. There were six masters in Zhang Qing’s group, but all of them had died without even being able to put up a fight. On the other hand, the strongest team here only had nine people, so no individual group was confident they could survive Yang Kai’s violent attack or resist his powerful Shi!</p>
<p>“Continue your comprehension, I don’t think anyone will bother us from now on,” Yang Kai motioned to Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao lightly.</p>
<p>The two exchanged a stunned glance and were somewhat at a loss, unable to believe what had just happened.</p>
<p>Just now, they had seen Yang Kai take action and joined in without hesitation, but they had never expected that victory would be so easily achieved. The two of them had thought there would be a bitter battle and perhaps one or all of them would end up falling here.</p>
<p>However, the result was them slaughtering the enemy without any difficulty.</p>
<p>When they killed their opponents, they clearly felt their helplessness.</p>
<p>As a result, once the battle was over, the two of them wound up in a kind of daze.</p>
<p>“Yang Kai, you seem to have grown a lot. Did you make a lot of gains in the Blood Prison already?” Qian Tong looked at him suspiciously.</p>
<p>He had participated in the attack on the three giants of Shadowed Star with Yang Kai, but at that time, Yang Kai had not been this strong. Back then, Qian Tong had felt that Yang Kai had unlimited potential, but had still yet to fully mature and thought that his own strength should be comparable to Yang Kai’s.</p>
<p>But now, it seemed Yang Kai had reached a height he could only look up to.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s breakthrough in cultivation was only a small part of the reason though, while Yang Kai’s accomplishments in Shi were clearly his strongest capital. Qian Tong vaguely felt that Yang Kai’s trip through the Blood Prison had yielded significant gains.</p>
<p>“Something like that,” Yang Kai nodded lightly, without explaining too much.</p>
<p>Qian Tong gently nodded, calming his mind and no longer thinking about this issue, but just as he was about to sit back down, he suddenly said, “Right, Yang Kai, about Brother Zhao, he…”</p>
<p>“You can decide,” Yang Kai smiled lightly before sitting down cross-legged himself.</p>
<p>Qian Tong nodded, thought about it for a moment, then walked over to a nearby spot where Zhao Tian Ze was standing dumbstruck and talked to the latter in a low voice.</p>
<p>A short time later, Zhao Tian Ze returned with a shameful expression, looked for an open spot, then sat down cross-legged, all the while looking at Yang Kai with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>He was indeed ashamed. Before, he had coveted life and feared death, not daring to remain to share difficulties with Qian Tong and the others, but now that the enemy has been extinguished, he had been allowed to come back and reap benefits without contributing any effort, a situation that made Zhao Tian Ze feel rather embarrassed.</p>
<p>If it were anything else, Zhao Tian Ze would most likely have refused as he still wanted to maintain some of his dignity.</p>
<p>But Domain Stone Mountain’s temptation was simply too great. Even if he felt extremely embarrassed doing so, he still grit his teeth and returned. Now that he was sitting down though, he couldn’t help feeling his old face burning up with shame.</p>
<p>“Brother Zhao, don’t think too much about it, in the situation just now, anyone who didn’t know about Yang Kai’s details would probably have made the same choice. There is nothing for you to apologize for. Brother Zhao, I know your temperament well.” Qian Tong comforted.</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze smiled bitterly, glanced over at Yang Kai with dim eyes, but upon seeing the latter just sit motionlessly, not showing any intention to speak, he simply sighed and said sincerely, “This Zhao is deeply grateful!”</p>
<p>He was even embarrassed to speak too many words.</p>
<p>Qian Tong patted him on the shoulder, trying to reassure him that everything was alright.</p>
<p>Around Domain Stone Mountain, hundreds of Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators gathered in large and small groups, each one occupying their own position.</p>
<p>Yang Kai and his group, however, occupied the largest spot, and even though there were only four of them, no one dared to approach. The fresh corpses and blood that still stained the ground were the best evidence of the battle which had happened earlier.</p>
<p>All around Yang Kai’s small group, there was a large open space that no one dared trespass upon.</p>
<p>From time to time, a cultivator who heard about Domain Stone Mountain’s appearance would arrive, and when they saw the open space on both sides of Yang Kai’s group, their eyes always lit up and thoughts of occupying these spots would fill their heads. However, once they saw the broken corpses nearby, their expressions all inevitably darkened and they would eventually give up.</p>
<p>Half a day later, Domain Stone Mountain was surrounded by two full layers with the number of cultivators now reaching as high as two hundred. What’s more, there were still other cultivators constantly arriving from afar.</p>
<p>Conflict inevitably occurred as more people came.</p>
<p>Teams with larger numbers always wanted to seize better positions while the groups that arrived here earlier naturally didn’t want to give up their spot, and if the two sides couldn’t work out some kind of agreement, a fight would naturally break out.</p>
<p>From time to time, dying cries would ring out.</p>
<p>The area around Domain Stone Mountain quickly transformed into a burial ground for Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters. Each of the fallen here was a famous character from a major Cultivation Star, making for an extremely intense scene.</p>
<p>However, no matter how intense the fighting became, Yang Kai’s group of four didn’t encounter any kind of provocation again.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s group occupying such a good position, with no one around them for quite some distance, was a telling sign. Anyone with a little bit of intelligence would understand that this small group was not to be trifled with and naturally wouldn’t go test their luck.</p>
<p>Qian Tong, Lin Yu Rao, and Zhao Tian Ze seemed to have become completely immersed in the wondrous aura being emitted from Domain Stone Mountain.</p>
<p>Yang Kai, however, didn’t enter a meditative state, instead just sitting cross-legged on the ground, supposedly guarding his group against anyone who dared make trouble for them, but the entire time, there was a strange grin that never left his face as he stared towards Domain Stone Mountain.</p>
<p>It was as if he was staring at something that was already in his pocket!</p>
<p>A day later, many cultivators who were cultivating faintly discovered something wrong.</p>
<p>As more time passed, the miraculous aura emanating from Domain Stone Mountain seemed to be diminishing. In the beginning, everyone felt they were just over-thinking things, but after a closer inspection, they found that this decrease in aura was really happening.</p>
<p>Domain Stone Mountain was slowly losing its effect!</p>
<p>This discovery left everyone at a loss as they wondered why Domain Stone Mountain, which had existed for thousands of years, had suddenly undergone such a change.</p>
<p>After two days, more and more cultivators discovered this phenomenon and soon, everyone became aware.</p>
<p>Whispers sounded one after another.</p>
<p>“What happened? It’s only been a few days, how come Domain Stone Mountain’s aura has weakened so greatly?”</p>
<p>“You noticed as well? I thought I was just imagining things.”</p>
<p>“Could it be that there are too many people here so all the power from Domain Stone Mountain is being absorbed?”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! When has the appearance of Domain Stone Mountain not attracted so many people? In the past, even more people had come to cultivate here but there had never been any kind of problem. Why is it happening this time?</p>
<p>“Could it be that Domain Stone Mountain is losing its function?”</p>
<p>“Stop speculating and take advantage of what little effect is left! If Domain Stone Mountain loses its aura entirely, it will become completely useless.”</p>
<p>The strange change in Domain Stone Mountain made every cultivator who came here feel a sense of crisis and everyone went all out to try to comprehend whatever mysteries from it they could in order to gain the most benefits in the little time they had.</p>
<p>By the third day, the cultivators in the outer periphery of Domain Stone Mountain actually couldn’t feel any kind of aura at all. Only those cultivators who occupied a spot in the inner layer could still gain something.</p>
<p>By the fourth day, however, it became difficult for even those in the inner circle to comprehend anything.</p>
<p>The effect of Domain Stone Mountain seemed to have reduced to a bare minimum. This was something which had never happened before. Domain Stone Mountain was the treasure of the Blood Prison and had existed for over ten thousand years, so no one was able to understand what was happening here.</p>
<p>Only Yang Kai continued to grin wider and wider as time passed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a soft cracking sound came from a certain position.</p>
<p>Although the noise was extremely slight, it attracted the attention of many people.</p>
<p>Focusing on the source of this sound, in an instant, many cultivators’ eyes bulged in surprise.</p>
<p>“A crack!? There’s a crack in Domain Stone Mountain!” Someone exclaimed, as if something extraordinary had been discovered.</p>
<p>“What? There’s a crack in Domain Stone Mountain? Impossible!” Some people refused to believe it.</p>
<p>What was Domain Stone Mountain? In essence, it was a single, massive Domain Stone, one that had remained undamaged for millennia, so how could it possibly crack all of a sudden?</p>
<p>However, just as some were trying to refuse this claim, more cracks appeared on Domain Stone Mountain. These tiny cracks soon spread out like a spider’s web, leaving a dense, criss-crossing pattern across the mountain’s surface.</p>
<p><em>Kacha…</em></p>
<p>“Not good, Domain Stone Mountain is going to be destroyed!”</p>
<p>“Is it really going to break apart? Hahaha, such good fortune! Father here was worried he wouldn’t be able to gain anything from this place but now it’s actually going to break apart! The Heavens are helping me.”</p>
<p>All kinds of shouts rang out at that instant as all the cultivators got up one after another, either with solemn or excited expressions as they focused all their attention on Domain Stone Mountain, each of them having different ideas in their hearts.</p>
<p>A tense atmosphere suddenly spread as the many cultivators who had been living in peace with one another now began eyeing everyone around them as if they were enemies.</p>
<p>Everyone was thinking about how to gain the most from ​​Domain Stone Mountain’s collapse.</p>
<p>“Yang Kai, we…” Qian Tong gulped hard as he stared at Domain Stone Mountain with fiery eyes.</p>
<p>But Yang Kai just frowned as he released his Divine Sense all around, his face suddenly changing a moment later as he called out in alarm, “Get back!”</p>
<h2>Chapter 1604, Heavy Losses</h2>
<p>“Withdraw?” Qian Tong was taken aback, wondering why Yang Kai was suddenly so anxious.</p>
<p>“Go now! It will be too late if you don’t,” Yang Kai didn’t explain, letting out one last shout before swiftly retreating, grabbing Lin Yu Rao on his way.</p>
<p>Lin Yu Rao was confused but did not resist, allowing Yang Kai to drag her away as he quickly flew hundreds of metres back.</p>
<p>“Brother Qian…” Zhao Tian Ze turned a bewildered look towards Qian Tong, asking for some clarification.</p>
<p>“Listen to Yang Kai,” Qian Tong turned into a stream of light without hesitation and followed Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Qian Tong did not know why Yang Kai would make such a choice, but he chose to trust Yang Kai unconditionally.</p>
<p>Perhaps Yang Kai had a profound reason!</p>
<p>Seeing that the three of them had already retreated, Zhao Tian Ze hesitated for a moment before slapping his thigh in annoyance and following them.</p>
<p>The scene quickly became chaotic.</p>
<p>As the cracks on Domain Stone Mountain continued to increase, countless cultivators rushed forward, trying to snatch the fragmented Domain Stone.</p>
<p>There were also some among the crowd who were quite shrewd, however, and upon hearing Yang Kai’s shout they noticed that something was wrong and withdrew quietly instead of wading in the muddy waters.</p>
<p>Something inexplicable was happening, and there was no way to tell what would happen when Domain Stone Mountain truly broke apart.</p>
<p>However, there were not many such people, only about a tenth of the total population. Everyone else lost to the temptation in front of them and ignored Yang Kai’s loud warning.</p>
<p><em>Kacha…</em></p>
<p>The cracking noises continued to grow louder as Domain Stone Mountain seemed to teeter on the verge of collapse. Before everyone’s eyes, the cracks on its surface grew longer and bigger at an increasing rate.</p>
<p>Soon after, Domain Stone Mountain collapsed and broke into innumerable Domain Stones over varying sizes.</p>
<p>What everyone felt was strange, however, was that the broken Domain Stones were not the same as those which appeared in Domain Vortices. Each piece of Domain Stone was as thin as a cicada’s wings.</p>
<p>“Impossible, was Domain Stone Mountain actually hollow the entire time?” Someone yelled in disbelief.</p>
<p>These paper-thin Domain Stones served as proof that Domain Stone Mountain was hollow inside. If not, how could its broken fragments be as thin as a cicada’s wing? The scene before everyone was similar to what would happen if a porcelain pot fell to the ground and broke.</p>
<p>This was an unacceptable reality for many people.</p>
<p>However, even these extremely thin Domain Stones were Domain Stones.</p>
<p>After a few breaths of surprise, the crowd rushed forward madly again as they began trying to seize these pieces of Domain Stone.</p>
<p>The scene instantly became chaotic!</p>
<p>The light from artifacts and Martial Skills was so blinding that an area with a radius of nearly a hundred metres became impossible to see into. Screams sounded; blood splashed…</p>
<p>Suddenly though, a ripple visible to the naked eye surged outwards at an astonishing speed from the centre of where Domain Stone Mountain once stood.</p>
<p>All the cultivators covered by this ripple involuntarily stopped their actions, their expression changing from ones of frenzy to ones of terror.</p>
<p>When this ripple swept across their bodies, they all felt a dangerous but familiar aura, Domain!</p>
<p>On top of that, it was an extremely powerful Domain!</p>
<p>The invisible Domain Stone Mountain’s unique Domain seemed to suddenly reappear at that moment.</p>
<p>“Not good, run!” A somewhat smarter cultivator shouted.</p>
<p>No one bothered trying to snatch the scattered Domain Stones anymore as every cultivator desperately pushed their Saint Qi and tried to flee outwards.</p>
<p>However, it was too late!</p>
<p>After the first wave appeared, a second followed, then a third… each wave propagating faster than the one before it.</p>
<p>In an instant, countless ripples visible to the naked eye filled a nearly one-thousand-metre radius around the ruins of Domain Stone Mountain.</p>
<p>Space distorted as the true power of Domain Stone Mountain’s overbearing Domain finally revealed its hideous appearance, like a wild and ravenous beast, opening its jaws wide as it swallowed nearly two hundred Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators into its belly.</p>
<p>Screams sounded in all directions, causing the skin of those who heard them to crawl. No Origin Returning Realm cultivator could withstand the crushing force of this violent Domain and the vigorous vitality of all those caught inside of it were swiftly extinguished, disappearing in a flash.</p>
<p>After being struck by this series of ripples, everyone caught in their range exploded into beautiful yet ghastly red blossoms.</p>
<p>Yang Kai and his group of four, standing a few thousand metres away from Domain Stone Mountain, instantly turned pale upon witnessing this sight.</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze shivered unconsciously as his teeth began to chatter.</p>
<p>He could easily imagine what would have happened to him if he had given in to his greed just now. He would certainly have been caught in that explosion of Domain just like everyone else and died a miserable death. Turning to look at Yang Kai, his heart filled with gratitude.</p>
<p>Had it not been for this young man who stood higher and saw further, this trip to the Blood Prison would have been over for him.</p>
<p>The complexions of Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao were not much better.</p>
<p>So many cultivators at the same realm as them, so many powerful masters who had the qualifications to strive for the Origin King Realm, had fallen here without being able to resist.</p>
<p>These people had been crushed as if they were ants…</p>
<p>Their mood was subtle and complicated.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the stone pavilion outside the Blood Prison, Luo Hai, who had been sitting peacefully, got up quickly, his expression suddenly turning ugly.</p>
<p>“Sir Luo Hai, what happened?” Seeing such a look on Luo Hai’s face, the old woman surnamed Lei asked nervously.</p>
<p>“Yes, Brother Luo Hai, what has happened to make you so anxious?” An old man also asked curiously.</p>
<p>Any master who had reached the Origin King Realm possessed exceptional control over their mental state and it was extremely rare for them to show shock, not to mention that Luo Hai was no ordinary Origin King. He was the Star Master of Green Mountains Star and a Second-Order Origin King. Even considering the entire Star Field, apart from a few old hidden dragons who never showed their faces anymore, not many people could claim to be stronger than him.</p>
<p>Luo Hai’s face suddenly turning so distraught made everyone realize that something terrible must have happened.</p>
<p>“Domain Stone Mountain has been destroyed!” Luo Hai quickly said.</p>
<p>“What? Are you certain?”</p>
<p>“Yes, how could Domain Stone Mountain be destroyed?”</p>
<p>“Who did it? Those little Juniors shouldn’t have such ability, right?”</p>
<p>Everyone began clamouring. If it had not been Luo Hai who was saying this, none of them would have believed it.</p>
<p>Even if Luo Hai said so, they still had doubts.</p>
<p>How could Domain Stone Mountain possibly have been destroyed?</p>
<p>“Sir Luo Hai, is this really true?” The old woman looked at Luo Hai solemnly.</p>
<p>“Why would this King make such a bad joke with you?” Luo Hai frowned, “As for how it was destroyed, this King is not clear, but it was definitely destroyed!”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at each other but didn’t question Luo Hai’s judgment.</p>
<p>He was this place’s Star Master, so since he said it happened, he must be completely certain.</p>
<p>No one present was able to just accept such a result, however.</p>
<p>“Haa, what a pity, Domain Stone Mountain is the treasure of the Blood Prison. It has existed for over ten thousand years but now it has been destroyed,” After a long silence, the old man who had spoken before sighed. Although Domain Stone Mountain existed on Green Mountains Star, it could be said to be a treasure to the entire Star Field. Now that it was ruined, everyone felt some regret.</p>
<p>Perhaps its destruction would result in far few Origin Kings rising in the Star Field!</p>
<p>“Sir Luo Hai, with Domain Stone Mountain being destroyed, what about the people who had been cultivating around it just now?” The old woman suddenly thought of a more serious problem.</p>
<p>When the others heard this, they all focused their attention anxiously.</p>
<p>“There were many deaths! The exact number of auras that vanished is impossible for this King to tell, but this King estimates that at least two hundred died.”</p>
<p>“Two hundred!?” The old woman’s face changed drastically, a bitter smile forming on her face after some time, “It seems all the great forces have suffered heavy losses then.”</p>
<p>The Blood Prison Trial always resulted in high casualties because the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators who entered didn’t fear each other and in order to gain a greater chance to reach the Origin King Realm they would even resort to killing others who stood in their way.</p>
<p>Today, however, the sudden change in Domain Stone Mountain had actually killed around two hundred cultivators who had entered the Blood Prison all at once. It was likely this tragedy had resulted in the participants from various great forces being completely wiped out.</p>
<p>Everyone quickly realized the seriousness of the problem.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, Third Young Master didn’t come this time, otherwise…” The old man from Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce suddenly broke out into a cold sweat, a look of fear filling his face.</p>
<p>If Xue Yue Third Young Master had also come to participate in the Blood Prison Trial this time and gone to Domain Stone Mountain…</p>
<p>The old man did not even want to imagine it!</p>
<p>Third Young Master Xue Yue was Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce’s greatest hope for the future.</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>Inside the Blood Prison, after just a few breaths of time, the chaotic scene calmed down again, but all the cultivators who had not withdrawn ahead of time had been reduced to ash. Only about thirty people survived this catastrophe.</p>
<p>These people had all heard Yang Kai’s warning and retreated immediately, saving their lives.</p>
<p>After recovering from their bout of terror, all of them cupped their fists towards Yang Kai, expressing their gratitude.</p>
<p>Domain Stone Mountain was now gone, so no one would remain here anymore. Everyone began splitting up and flying off in different directions, going deeper into the Blood Prison to continue searching for opportunities.</p>
<p>Soon, only Yang Kai and his group of four were left in this wide-open area.</p>
<p>“Sect Master Yang, this old master is eternally grateful for your life-saving efforts. After leaving the Blood Prison, this Zhao earnestly wishes that Sect Master Yang come to Green Water City so this Zhao can offer his utmost thanks and hospitality!” Zhao Tian Ze said sincerely as he displayed genuine and profound respect for Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled faintly and said, “City Lord Zhao is too polite, I didn’t do anything, but I will certainly pass through Green Water City when all of this is over. I hope I won’t be inconveniencing City Lord Zhao then.”</p>
<p>Qian Yue was still searching for information about Su Yan back in Green Water City, so Yang Kai was certainly going to go pick her up.</p>
<p>“Certainly not!” Zhao Tian Ze waved his hand quickly as a smile appeared on his face, “Sect Master Yang visiting is this Zhao’s honour, how could it possibly be any inconvenience?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently nodded before turning to Qian Tong and Lin Yu Rao and saying, “Be careful from here on out.”</p>
<p>Hearing these words, Lin Yu Rao flashed a slight look of disappointment, “Sect Master won’t be joining us?”</p>
<p>“No, I still have something I need to do,” Yang Kai shook his head. He had yet to obtain the Origin Essence Crystal Chi Yue requested of him, and with the other half of the Monster Transformation Art in Yu Xiong’s hands, Yang Kai really had no other choice.</p>
<p>The Source strength of the Golden Divine Dragon in his body was something Yang Kai was extremely eager to develop.</p>
<p>“Then you should also be careful out there. I am confident that no one here is your opponent, but you still need to remain wary of the scattered Domains here as they are very powerful. Don’t push yourself too hard,” Qian Tong warned</p>
<h2>Chapter 1605, Monster Mountain</h2>
<p>“I know, I won’t overexert myself,” Yang Kai grinned, “Then let’s separate here. When this is over, we’ll rendezvous in Green Water City.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai cupped his fists briefly after he finished speaking, turned around, and flew off in a streak of light, quickly disappearing from Qian Tong and the other’s sight.</p>
<p>“Let’s go too,” Qian Tong said, “With so many people dying this time, the competition in the Blood Prison will probably be reduced greatly. We can’t miss this chance to look for opportunities.”</p>
<p>“It is just as Brother Qian says!” Zhao Tian Ze’s eyes lit up, his gloomy mood swiftly giving way to excitement and anticipation.</p>
<p>Somewhere, hundreds of kilometres away from Domain Stone Mountain where no one else was around, Yang Kai landed, double-checked his surroundings, then grinned and whispered, “Come out.”</p>
<p>The next moment, a rustling came from the ground in front of him and a small head with two beady eyes popped out. After this creature leapt out of the ground, it rushed over to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>It was the Stone Puppet, Xiao Xiao.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had secretly released his Stone Puppet while fighting against Zhang Qing’s group while everyone was distracted by his shockingly strong Shi.</p>
<p>Everything had gone according to plan.</p>
<p>“How’s the harvest?” Yang Kai asked, looking down at Xiao Xiao.</p>
<p>The Stone Puppet didn’t show any reaction, simply opening its mouth and spitting out a fist-sized Domain Stone from his mouth.</p>
<p>Yang Kai stretched out his hand, grabbed the Domain Stone, and felt it for a moment before bursting into laughter and patting Xiao Xiao’s small head, praising him liberally, “Good job!”</p>
<p>He didn’t know exactly how many Domain Stone’s were resting in Xiao Xiao’s stomach right now, but the quantity was clearly so great it would cause any Origin King to become jealous.</p>
<p>It could be said that the destruction of Domain Stone Mountain was entirely due to Xiao Xiao.</p>
<p>Xiao Xiao had silently snuck below Domain Stone Mountain and then slowly hollowed it out with no one being the wiser. This was the reason the cultivators felt that the effects of Domain Stone Mountain were getting weaker and weaker as time passed, and why Domain Stone Mountain had suddenly collapsed and turned out hollow inside.</p>
<p>Everything was thanks to the Stone Puppet!</p>
<p>Domain Stone Mountain was indeed extremely hard, but the Stone Puppet’s innate talent allowed it to swallow any and all kinds of ores. The Coloured Glass Sect’s treasure, Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Mountain, had a gaping hole excavated from it, and Domain Stone Mountain wasn’t a problem either.</p>
<p>The first time he saw Domain Stone Mountain, Yang Kai already had such crooked thoughts.</p>
<p>He hadn’t anticipated that allowing the Stone Puppet to do so would destroy Domain Stone Mountain and trigger such a terrifying Domain explosion, however.</p>
<p>This was why, when he noticed something was wrong, he shouted loudly to warn everyone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the cultivators present were blinded by the treasures in front of them and paid no attention to his reminders. Only a few people retreated with him, but this swift action had saved their lives.</p>
<p>After ordering the Stone Puppet to follow him, Yang Kai took it to a more remote location and let it spit out all the Domain Stones in its stomach.</p>
<p>After checking his haul, Yang Kai was overjoyed.</p>
<p>There were roughly three thousand Domain Stones!</p>
<p>This was an extremely terrifying number, as could be seen from the fact that Yang Kai’s gains since entering the Blood Prison were just three Domain Stones until now. Others may not have even gained that many.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, Yang Kai had managed to obtain three thousand Domain Stones!</p>
<p>This was probably more Domain Stones than had been collected by cultivators since Blood Prison was created!</p>
<p>There was now no need to worry about comprehending Domain in the future. With so many Domain Stones in hand, Yang Kai could unscrupulously absorb the magical energy inside them to gain insight into Domain and spy upon the mysteries of the Origin King Realm.</p>
<p>His future path was looking smoother and brighter!</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s mood was great.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the cultivators who entered the Blood Prison was to use Domain Vortices to polish their Shi, but their secondary objective was to find Domain Stones.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had cleared both goals handily.</p>
<p>Without even mentioning the massive number of Domain Stones he had now, the various Domain Vortices could no longer slow down Yang Kai’s pace either as his understanding of Shi had reached a new height. Even if he had yet to reach the grand accomplishment stage, he wasn’t far off.</p>
<p>Perhaps, one day, when he broke through to the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, Yang Kai would be able to instantly achieve the grand accomplishment stage in Shi and possess the capital to break through to the Origin King Realm!</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t plan on wasting any more time. He was now going to find the Origin Essence Crystal left behind by the Monster King who died here over ten thousand years ago to complete the task assigned to him by Chi Yue.</p>
<p>On Monster Emperor Star, there were Ten Great Tribal Lords, but no Tribal Lord was qualified to be called a Monster King.</p>
<p>To become a Monster King, one needed to possess a Third-Order Origin King cultivation. Therefore, only a handful of Monster Kings had been born on Monster Emperor Star since ancient times.</p>
<p>There was one over ten thousand years ago, but unfortunately for him, he had gotten involved in the war on Green Mountains Star and wound up falling in the Blood Prison.</p>
<p>The specific location where this Monster King fell had already been given to Yang Kai by Chi Yue. Monster Emperor Star had been secretly sending Monster Race rising stars to the Blood Prison Trial for many years now, so they had already managed to scout out a good deal of information; unfortunately, until now, there had never been an opportunity to retrieve that Origin Essence Crystal.</p>
<p>Yang Kai flew towards his destination without pause.</p>
<p>He wasn’t certain if it was because of the changes in Domain Stone Mountain that killed so many people, but along the way, Yang Kai felt that the number of cultivators in the Blood Prison had indeed decreased a lot. After flying for a few days, he didn’t notice any other auras around him anymore.</p>
<p>There was a bare hill ahead, no more than a thousand metres high, with not even a blade of grass growing upon it, only gravel and mud.</p>
<p>However, this hill exuded a very strange aura, one that made it difficult to approach.</p>
<p>Monster Qi! And a very powerful Monster Qi at that.</p>
<p>Even a cultivator at the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm wouldn’t dare set foot upon this hill easily, because the omnipresent Monster Qi was not something they could bear. If a cultivator stayed for a long time on this hill, the Monster Qi would begin invading their bodies.</p>
<p>The Monster Qi here was naturally a leftover from the fallen Monster King and could not be purged by mere Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators. Eventually, not only would this Monster Qi corrode their meridians and physique, it would trigger a kind of Monster Transformation, creating dissonance in their cultivation.</p>
<p>Therefore, whenever the Blood Prison opened, this strange hill had always been regarded as a Restricted Area that no one dared to enter at will. Most would even go out of their way to avoid it lest they be inadvertently affected by the potent Monster Qi.</p>
<p>“This should be the place!” Yang Kai looked up at the bare hill and muttered to himself softly. The hill in front of him perfectly matched the description given to him by Chi Yue about where that ancient Monster King had fallen.</p>
<p>After scanning the area for a moment, Yang Kai stepped forward towards the hill.</p>
<p>A short time later, Yang Kai came to the foot of the hill and as soon as he stepped onto it, the ambient Monster Qi reacted like a cat smelling fish, rushing towards him from all directions, drilling into his pores and flooding into his meridians.</p>
<p>Yang Kai pushed his Saint Qi to resist the invasion of this Monster Qi.</p>
<p>It was a bit troublesome! Worthy of the Monster Qi left over by a Monster King level master, it couldn’t easily be resisted even after more than ten thousand years.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Yang Kai possessed the power of Golden Divine Dragon Source, so even if the Monster Qi forced its way into his body, it wouldn’t affect him much. If Yang Kai were any other Human Race Origin Returning Realm cultivator, he would likely have to withdraw immediately.</p>
<p>After confirming that there was no serious threat to him here, Yang Kai strode upwards step by step.</p>
<p>Soon, he came to the top of the mountain and looked around. The surroundings were empty, however, which made him frown.</p>
<p>The information Chi Yue gave him only said that the Origin Essence Crystal was somewhere on this barren mountain, but even she didn’t know exactly where it was.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t on top of the mountain though, it should be somewhere nearby. Silently sweeping the area with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai soon detected something and moved towards a certain direction.</p>
<p>After a stick of incense worth of time, Yang Kai arrived at the back of the hill and stood looking into a dark cave.</p>
<p>The cave was pitch black and didn’t seem out of the ordinary, but when Yang Kai’s Divine Sense tried to penetrate into it, it bounced back.</p>
<p>If his guess was correct, the Monster King should have fallen in this cave, because the Monster Qi was densest in this location.</p>
<p>Unafraid, Yang Kai took out a luminous stone from his Space Ring and stepped into the cave.</p>
<p>The deeper he went in, the richer the Monster Qi became, indicating that its source was up ahead!</p>
<p>A short time later, Yang Kai arrived at the deepest part of the cave.</p>
<p>Here, the cave showed signs of being artificially excavated. It was narrow on the outside while wide on the inside, and the innermost cavern was actually several dozen metres across.</p>
<p>Inside this innermost cave, there was a massive object that an amazing Monster Qi was spreading from.</p>
<p>Yang Kai took out a few more luminous stones and with a wave of his hand sent them all into pre-arranged grooves in the surrounding stone walls.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the entire dim cave became bright.</p>
<p>Looking forward again, Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as they shined with shock.</p>
<p>He surprisingly discovered that the massive object lying in front of him was a giant skeleton!</p>
<p>A huge Monster Beast skeleton!</p>
<p>This skeleton was over twenty metres long and had the appearance of a giant ancient crocodile. Even if it was now just bones, it still exuded an amazing level of energy.</p>
<p>This corpse should be the true body of the Monster King level master. It seemed this Monster King had reverted to his Monster Beast form before death, otherwise, his corpse would not have appeared in this manner.</p>
<p>Generally, if a Monster Race cultivator was born in human form, they would also die in human form, but some cultivated Secret Techniques that could stimulate their Monster Beast bloodlines and allow them to resume their Monster Beast forms to gain additional strength.</p>
<p>This giant skeleton appearing must have been a result of the ancient Monster King assuming his Monster Beast form.</p>
<p>This was the most orthodox type of Monster Race master, one that possessed an extremely pure bloodline!</p>
<p>What’s more, this Monster Beast was a Third-Order Origin King! Even after ten thousand years, its bones were still lifelike, each one looking extremely strong. These were definitely excellent Artifact Refining materials.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes instantly became fiery.</p>
<p>Chi Yue only said that he needed to hand over the Origin Essence Crystal to Yu Xiong, she never mentioned handing over the Monster King’s skeleton. In other words, Yang Kai was free to claim these bones for himself.</p>
<p>High Heaven Sect was currently in its development phase, and there were some highly accomplished Artifact Refiners among its members. These Artifact Refiners had come from Star Emperor Mountain, and although they were incomparable to Yang Yan, they were still second to no one else on Shadowed Star. If these bones were taken back and given to them for Artifact Refining, Yang Kai believed that they could definitely refine a large number of Origin Grade High-Rank artifacts!</p>
<p>Even this, however, was something of a careless waste of Heaven’s treasures as, in principle, the bones of an Origin King Realm Monster Beast were precious materials that could be refined into Origin King Grade artifacts.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1606, You Finally Came Out</h2>
<p>As such wild thoughts crossed his mind, Yang Kai cast his gaze towards the chest of the Monster Beast skeleton.</p>
<p>In an instant, his eyes grew hotter.</p>
<p>He clearly saw that there was a dark red round crystal about the size of a melon there.</p>
<p>The Origin Essence Crystal! It could also be called the core of this Monster King!</p>
<p>Two different names, both referring to the same thing.</p>
<p>Only a master at the Third-Order Origin King Realm could condense an Origin Essence Crystal, not even Second-Order Origin Kings had the qualifications.</p>
<p>An Origin Essence Crystal contained its master’s perceptions of the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao, as well as their understanding of Domain. Its value was simply inestimable!</p>
<p>The biggest reason Chi Yue wanted to acquire this Origin Essence Crystal was to use it to break through to the Third-Order Origin King Realm and become a true Monster King.</p>
<p>Looking at the entire Star Field, how many Third-Order Origin Kings were there? Their number could likely be counted on a single hand, and most were hidden dragons who never showed their faces. Hardly anyone knew where these peak level masters resided and meeting one was as difficult as ascending to the Heavens.</p>
<p>Yet now, the remains of such a master were lying in front of Yang Kai, and not only was its skeleton intact, but its Origin Essence Crystal was also present.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s breathing inevitably became a bit rapid as he stared at the Origin Essence Crystal hotly.</p>
<p>Carefully releasing his Divine Sense, Yang Kai extended it forward slowly, but before he could touch the Origin Essence Crystal, the dark red circular crystal suddenly flashed brilliantly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned, and quickly retracted his Divine Sense, not daring to spy on it at will.</p>
<p>Chi Yue was right. This Origin Essence Crystal still retained a strand of the Monster King’s Remnant Soul. Any attempt to meddle with it would provoke resistance. If this were not the case, how could this Origin Essence Crystal and skeleton still linger here? It would have been taken away long ago.</p>
<p>The only way to safely obtain the Origin Essence Crystal was to suppress that strand of Remnant Soul.</p>
<p>But the cultivators who entered the Blood Prison had at best reached the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, so who among them would have the ability to suppress the Remnant Soul of a Monster King?</p>
<p>Only Yang Kai’s Golden Divine Dragon’s Source had such power!</p>
<p>Exhaling lightly, Yang Kai calmed his mind and focused his attention on the Origin Essence Crystal, remaining motionless for a time.</p>
<p>In the darkness, however, an almost imperceptible black shadow cautiously approached Yang Kai. This black shadow clung to the ground, as if it had no substance, not even emitting any aura. Even Yang Kai, with his unusually sharp senses, did not notice it.</p>
<p>The black shadow approached little by little and soon came to a position less than five metres behind him. Slowly, this black shadow condensed into a tiny snake-like object and aimed itself at Yang Kai’s back.</p>
<p>At that moment though, Yang Kai’s body shook slightly and a thunderous dragon roar rang out, filling the cave with an irresistible coercion.</p>
<p>On Yang Kai’s right arm, golden scales suddenly strangely appeared, wrapping his entire right arm. Not only the right arm but even the back of his hand was covered in scales while his five fingers began bursting with golden light, his nails growing longer and releasing a cold glow as they slowly took the form of a claw.</p>
<p>Dragon Transformation!</p>
<p>After cultivating the first half of the Monster Transformation Secret Art, Yang Kai could just barely manipulate the power of the Golden Divine Dragon Source inside his body to transform his right arm into that of a dragon’s.</p>
<p>Swiftly, Yang Kai’s entire right arm transformed beyond recognition, taking on a terrifying aura.</p>
<p>The black shadow that was five metres behind Yang Kai was obviously taken aback by this development and quickly flattened itself to the ground again and retreated.</p>
<p>In a flash, Yang Kai moved, pushing his right arm forward in a thrust that seemed to break through the barrier of space to close in on the Origin Essence Crystal.</p>
<p>Light flashed wildly around the Origin Essence Crystal and a vague restless aura surged from it as if it was about to burst.</p>
<p>Yang Kai snorted coldly and grabbed the Origin Essence Crystal in his hand before squeezing it hard. At the same time, he madly poured his Saint Qi and Spiritual Energy towards the crystal.</p>
<p>A soft noise seemed to echo from the Origin Essence Crystal and the restless aura gradually subsided.</p>
<p>The golden scale armour on Yang Kai’s right arm gradually faded and the terrifying right arm returned to its normal state.</p>
<p>Opening his fist, Yang Kai observed the Origin Essence Crystal in his hand and grinned.</p>
<p>The Remnant Soul wisp which remained in the Origin Essence Crystal had now been wiped away by him. Now, anyone could hold this Origin Essence Crystal in their hand without worrying about it self-destructing.</p>
<p>The entire process was far simpler and easier than Yang Kai had expected.</p>
<p>Chi Yue had warned him repeatedly of the dangers he would encounter so Yang Kai had thought he would encounter at least some hardships, but it actually turned about to be no trouble at all.</p>
<p>“Hm?” Yang Kai looked at this Origin Essence Crystal up close with a strange look on his face.</p>
<p>He vaguely felt that this Origin Essence Crystal seemed a bit familiar, as if he had seen it before.</p>
<p>After thinking about it carefully, Yang Kai suddenly realized that he indeed had encountered an Origin Essence Crystal before.</p>
<p>It was when he first entered the Flowing Flame Sand Field!</p>
<p>Inside the Flowing Flame Sand Field, in the pool filled with Soul Cleansing Divine Water, he managed to obtain a strange crystal-like object. At that time, Yang Kai did not know what it was, only that when he used his Divine Sense to investigate it, the crystal had strangely disappeared and entered his Knowledge Sea.</p>
<p>In the end, the mysterious crystal was completely absorbed by the Six Coloured Soul Warming Lotus, resulting in it successfully evolving into its Seven-Coloured form. Yang Kai also comprehended his Blossoming Lotus Secret Technique at that time.</p>
<p>[So that thing was an Origin Essence Crystal!] Yang Kai finally understood.</p>
<p>No wonder the effect it had on his Soul Warming Lotus was so great it allowed for an evolution. The only pity was he was unable to comprehend anything about Domain from that Origin Essence Crystal. It seems that the master who fell where the Soul Cleansing Divine Water pond was at least a Third-Order Origin King.</p>
<p>Such events happened many years ago though, so Yang Kai didn’t have any plans to investigate it carefully. After understanding all this, he lightly stored the Origin Essence Crystal away.</p>
<p>Although this thing was precious, Yang Kai was more interested in obtaining that Monster Transformation Secret Art!</p>
<p>In the end, he still had to hand it over to Chi Yue.</p>
<p>What’s more, Chi Yue was still Shan Qing Luo’s adoptive mother. If she became stronger, the shelter she could give Shan Qing Luo would be stronger.</p>
<p>Yang Kai understood this well so he never thought about keeping the Origin Essence Crystal for himself. He also believed that, with his own ability, he would one day break through to the Third-Order Origin King realm and reach the peak of the Martial Dao even without relying on this Origin Essence Crystal.</p>
<p>Turning around, Yang Kai stored the Monster King skeleton next. Of course, the Monster King’s Space Ring was not left by Yang Kai either. Although he did not know what was inside of it, the wealth of a Third-Order Origin King would obviously not be small.</p>
<p>This was his biggest gain from this trip.</p>
<p>After checking the cave carefully one last time to confirm he had left nothing behind, Yang Kai left.</p>
<p>The cave wasn’t too deep, so it didn’t take long for Yang Kai to emerge once more.</p>
<p>“You finally came out!”</p>
<p>Just as he stepped out of the cave, however, a somewhat familiar voice sounded from a nearby spot under the ground nearby and a blood-red figure suddenly shot up into the sky, landed in front of Yang Kai, and unleashed a violent storm of attacks.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face became cold and Golden Blood Threads shot out from his fingers, dancing through the air as they formed an airtight barrier in front of him.</p>
<p><em>Hong Hong Hong…</em></p>
<p>There was a violent burst of energy, and all the attacks performed by the blood-red figure were stopped by the Golden Blood Thread barrier.</p>
<p>“Xue Lian!” Yang Kai finally saw who it was that launched this sneak attack and could not help letting out a shout filled with murderous intent.</p>
<p>“That’s right, it’s your grandpa Xue Lian!” Xue Lian roared furiously. He had already used his Flood Dragon Transformation and his entire body was covered in strong looking blood-red scales. Not even pausing for an instant, he desperately bombarded Yang Kai with attacks.</p>
<p>“Seems you’ve come to court death!” Yang Kai sneered, his thoughts flashing as he sent two Golden Blood Threads out that suddenly transformed into Thunder Flame Flying Lizards then proceeded to bare their fangs and pounce towards Xue Lian.</p>
<p>“How could mere lizards compete with my Blood Flood Dragon’s power?” Xue Lian seemed to have completely forgotten the harsh lessons he had received at Chi Yue’s palace and attacked Yang Kai without any fear. His fists, covered in thick scales, threw out two punches, condensing two blood-coloured dragons from his Monster Qi. Shaking their heads and wagging their tails, these two blood-coloured dragons met the two Thunder Flame Flying Lizards head-on and entangled them without losing any momentum.</p>
<p>At the same time, Xue Lian raised his hand and summoned a giant axe to it, which he slashed towards Yang Kai viciously.</p>
<p>An astonishing axe light that seemed capable of smashing anything in its path flew towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s figure flickered as he dodged this blow.</p>
<p>At that moment though, another figure flew out from the ground and pushed both his palms forward, condensing a strange, giant flower that resembled an enormous beast’s mouth that bit towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face became gloomy as he pushed his Space Force and mysteriously disappeared from his position only to reappear a few dozen metres away.</p>
<p>The strange flower failed to play any role and immediately flew back to the hands of the second attacker, its petals opening and closing just like it was breathing, releasing a sweet fragrance into the air.</p>
<p>“Mi Tian!” Yang Kai grinned as he revealed a playful look, “Great! You’re both here! It seems you knew I would come here; were you lying in ambush?”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” Mi Tian smiled lightly, his expression calm and temperate. “You possess a Divine Dragon Source, and the Origin Essence Crystal’s existence here is not a secret amongst my Monster Race. After you suddenly joined the group our Monster Emperor Star sent to the Blood Prison, how could we not know what you were planning? Was it Senior Chi Yue who asked you to come?”</p>
<p>“Not bad, it seems like your intellect isn’t lacking!” Yang Kai nodded lightly.</p>
<p>“And the Origin Essence Crystal?” Mi Tian’s breathing became a little quick.</p>
<p>“Since I came out, what do you think happened to that Origin Essence Crystal?” Yang Kai smiled lightly.</p>
<p>“You really succeeded!” Mi Tian took a breath, the greed on his face obvious to any who looked.</p>
<p>“You want it?” Yang Kai looked at him sarcastically, “With only you two, I’m afraid you don’t have such ability. You’d best be careful not to overestimate yourselves!”</p>
<p>Seeing the naked contempt Yang Kai had for them, neither Xue Lian nor Mi Tian felt comfortable.</p>
<p>Although they did not want to admit it, both of them knew that when it came to a one on one fight, neither of them was Yang Kai’s opponent. Back at Chi Yue’s palace, Yang Kai had already proven his strength.</p>
<p>“Whether we have enough ability, we’ll see after we fight,” Mi Tian coldly snorted.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was about to laugh when he suddenly frowned and fully released his Shi, creating a hundred-metre zone around himself where space began to warp and innumerable tiny Void Cracks swam about like snakes.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1607, Insufficient</h2>
<p>In the collapsed and chaotic space, a cold light suddenly appeared. It seemed that this light had originally tried to attack Yang Kai’s back; however, the twisted space affected its accuracy, causing it to miss and become swallowed by The Void.</p>
<p>With a soft thud, a third figure appeared like a ghost, frowning as it leapt back. Wearing a solemn expression, this newcomer shook his head and sighed, “He is truly difficult to deal with!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai stood tall, like a mountain, glanced back coldly, and said with some surprise, “Lie Feng! You’re also here!”</p>
<p>He had not expected that the third person who attacked him would be Lie Feng from Wild Lion Territory.</p>
<p>Three rising stars of the Monster Race from three territories had gathered!</p>
<p>Mi Tian and Xue Lian’s ambush Yang Kai could understand; after all, there was some friction between him and these two so how could they possibly give up such an opportunity? But Lie Feng being involved in this matter was really a surprise. When Yang Kai first entered the Blood Prison, Lie Feng had invited him to act together, but now, only a few days later, he turned into an enemy who launched a sneak attack on him.</p>
<p>On Monster Mountain, the Monster Qi was quite thick, so it was not difficult for these three Monster Race rising stars to hide themselves perfectly. If Yang Kai’s senses had not been unusually sharp, Lie Feng’s sneak attack may really have succeeded.</p>
<p>“Lie Feng, I have no grievances with you, right?” Yang Kai looked at him coldly and asked calmly.</p>
<p>Lie Feng gave a dry laugh and quickly said, “Naturally not.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you doing this?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>“Brother Yang, please forgive me,” Lie Feng said slightly apologetically, cupping his fists and saying calmly. “To be honest, I don’t want to be enemies with Brother Yang if possible, but since this matter involves that Origin Essence Crystal, I cannot stay out of it.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded, “Understood.”</p>
<p>“Now that Brother Yang understands, this Lie can relax. Every Tribal Lord is aware of the Origin Essence Crystal here and wants to obtain it; however, there was no way to do so. Now that Brother Yang has achieved this, I cannot simply let you leave with it. If Brother Yang can hand over the Origin Essence Crystal, I think Xue Lian and Mi Tian should let you go safely though.”</p>
<p>“Do you think I’ll hand it over?” Yang Kai sneered softly.</p>
<p>Lie Feng thought about it for a while, then said seriously, “No. If I was in your place, I wouldn’t hand it over either.”</p>
<p>“Why are you bothering with all this nonsense? Let’s just kill him quickly! No matter how strong he is, he is all alone, so why should we fear him when there are three of us joining forces?” Xue Lian was the most hot-tempered here, and seeing Yang Kai and Lie Feng chat idly, he felt extremely worked up. After shouting out loud, Xue Lian put strength into his legs and rushed towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Releasing all his strength, Xue Lian condensed a huge Blood Flood Dragon phantom behind his back.</p>
<p>Xue Lian clearly knew Yang Kai’s strength so he went all out right from the start!</p>
<p>Mi Tian did not bother with any nonsense. The moment Xue Lian acted, he also roared and sent the strange flower atop his head into a whirl, its petals flying out, disappearing into thin air as they shot forward.</p>
<p>Lie Feng’s figure also faded away again and disappeared without a trace, his figure completely hidden from view.</p>
<p>The three Monster Race rising stars launched an all-out assault all at once.</p>
<p>“Good! Since all of you are courting death, I’ll satisfy you!” Yang Kai, in a one versus three, not only remained fearless but rather his expression became fierce. Five-coloured rays of light suddenly covered his whole body and scrapings sounds seemed to ring out from his body as tiny, nearly invisible Five Elements Sword Qi emerged from every pore on his skin. This extremely sharp Sword Qi provided an extremely strong barrier, but also greatly enhanced his offensive strength.</p>
<p>Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi was originally for both offence and defence!</p>
<p>With his muscles pulling taut, filled with explosive power, Yang Kai threw out three punches to meet Xue Lian’s wild attack.</p>
<p>A violent explosion broke out between the two parties, causing space itself to tremble.</p>
<p>Yang Kai remained unmoved while Xue Lian’s sturdy body recoiled sharply three times before his arms fell weakly to his sides.</p>
<p>In a head-on collision, he was obviously not Yang Kai’s opponent!</p>
<p>Without giving Xue Lian a chance to react, Yang Kai clenched his fist and gathered a dozen Golden Blood Threads together, condensed them into a golden spear, then thrust it towards Xue Lian at phenomenal speed.</p>
<p>Xue Lian’s complexion changed drastically as his eyes filled with shock.</p>
<p>The instant they clashed, he realized that Yang Kai was now much stronger than when they had fought back at Chi Yue’s palace!</p>
<p>At that time, Yang Kai was only a bit stronger than him, but now, Xue Lian was feeling completely suppressed, unable to think of any way to resist. Yang Kai’s imposing offensive smashed his confidence as if it were rotten wood.</p>
<p>This situation could only be explained two ways. One was that Yang Kai had not used his full strength previously, and the other was that Yang Kai had experienced significant growth in the Blood Prison!</p>
<p>Xue Lian’s courage completely shattered!</p>
<p>Perceiving the terrifying power contained in the golden spear, Xue Lian didn’t dare neglect it and hurriedly summoned a defensive artifact in front of him while at the same time crossing his arms across his chest, gritting his teeth, and roaring fiercely, preparing to meet this attack.</p>
<p><em>Guangdang…</em></p>
<p>A sound like metal pounding metal echoed throughout Monster Mountain.</p>
<p>The protective artifact that Xue Lian hurriedly summoned failed to play any role and was directly pierced by the golden spear, allowing it to stab towards him without any reduction in momentum.</p>
<p>On Xue Lian’s arms, the blood-coloured scales were easily punctured, leaving behind a bone deep wound that sprayed out blood as his body was sent flying into the dark cave.</p>
<p>A clattering rang out from the depths of the cave that did not stop for some time. No one knew where Xue Lian finally landed or how badly he was wounded.</p>
<p>Yang Kai turned around without stopping and waved his hand, creating a massive crescent-shaped Void Crack behind him that immediately began swallowing everything around it.</p>
<p>Lie Feng’s panicked cry rang out as his embarrassed figure re-appeared and hurriedly retreated. Staring at the crescent-shaped Void Crack with a solemn expression, he did not dare approach and could only avoid it.</p>
<p>He had been forced out by Yang Kai without even being able to launch an attack.</p>
<p>Strange flower petals suddenly appeared around Yang Kai, spinning like sharp blades as they scythed toward him from all directions. While these petals spun, however, they also scattered an intoxicating fragrance that seemed to affect one’s consciousness.</p>
<p>This attack by Mi Tian was timed perfectly to catch Yang Kai off balance after he forced Lie Feng back.</p>
<p>In an instant, the countless petals engulfed Yang Kai and re-formed the strange flower from before.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s figure disappeared at that moment! It was as if he had been swallowed by this strange flower.</p>
<p>Mi Tian did not celebrate, though, and instead frowned tightly as he looked around nervously.</p>
<p>He could perceive that his attack had no effect and that Yang Kai somehow escaped at the critical moment.</p>
<p>“You want to kill me? The three of you are not enough!” A sarcastic voice came from nearby, causing Mi Tian’s eyes to shrink as he quickly looked up to see Yang Kai mid-air completely unscathed.</p>
<p>His face suddenly became gloomy.</p>
<p>Lie Feng quietly appeared beside Mi Tian and also stared coldly, without saying a word.</p>
<p>Three Monster Race rising stars teaming up may not have been enough to face a genuine Origin King, but at the very least they should have been invincible in the Origin Returning Realm.</p>
<p>None of them were ordinary Origin Returning Realm cultivators, all of them being the top elite from Monster Emperor Star!</p>
<p>But the result of this brief battle caused their blood to turn cold!</p>
<p>Without any significant effort, Yang Kai had managed to resolve all their attacks and even send Xue Lian flying. Even now, there was no sign of Xue Lian moving, or even if he was still alive. Meanwhile, the remaining two rising stars had been completely suppressed.</p>
<p>“Is this bastard really human?” Lie Feng brow twitched, deeply regretting wading into these muddy waters.</p>
<p>He knew that Yang Kai was very powerful, otherwise he would not have been able to teach Xue Lian a lesson at Chi Yue’s palace, so when he first entered the Blood Prison, he had invited Yang Kai to act together.</p>
<p>But after he learned about the Origin Essence Crystal from Mi Tian and Xue Lian, he could not just sit idly by.</p>
<p>The Origin Essence Crystal was simply too valuable, enough so that he had to take some risks if it meant he could obtain it.</p>
<p>He had thought that by working with Xue Lian and Mi Tian, ​​Yang Kai would be outnumbered and overwhelmed, but judging from their brief confrontation now, Lei Feng realized it was their side that was in danger!</p>
<p>This human was simply too Heaven-defying! With only a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation, he must be a unique existence across all of history for being able to achieve this degree of strength.</p>
<p>“Lie Feng, stay focused. There’s no medicine in this world for regret, now it is either he dies or we die!” Mi Tian glanced at him with a gloomy expression, his determination to kill Yang Kai not wavering.</p>
<p>Lie Feng slowly shook his head, “There is no turning back an arrow already released from a bow, I naturally understand this. Alright, once Brother Xue Lian returns, we’ll attack all at once, only then will we have a chance!”</p>
<p>Mi Tian did not refute. When facing Yang Kai, he had no choice but to throw away his pride.</p>
<p>The two stood side by side, their eyes wandering between Yang Kai and the cave nearby anxiously.</p>
<p>Xue Lian remained silent, however, as if he had really been killed by Yang Kai with a single move.</p>
<p>But that should have been impossible. No matter how powerful Yang Kai was, Xue Lian had displayed his Flood Dragon Transformation and had extremely solid defence, so how could he have died so easily?</p>
<p>Mi Tian and Lie Feng did not understand what Xue Lian was doing and were silently cursing him for screwing up at such a crucial moment.</p>
<p>Suddenly though, a terrible roar rang out from inside the cave, one that was both thunderous and deafening.</p>
<p>“It’s Xue Lian!” Mi Tian frowned, his expression becoming uncertain. He did not know why Xue Lian was crying out so madly. Even if he were enraged and unwilling, his normal response would have been to rush out and challenge Yang Kai again, so what was he doing?</p>
<p>“Something’s not right!” Lie Feng suddenly felt an inexplicable sense of crisis grip his heart, an instinctual warning telling him to retreat immediately if he wanted to preserve his life.</p>
<p>This feeling made him extremely uncomfortable!</p>
<p>Like Mi Tian and Lie Feng, Yang Kai also looked towards the cave with dignified eyes, faintly aware that something was wrong.</p>
<p>However, he was more curious than concerned. He did not know what Xue Lian was doing, or whether he was about to use some earth-shattering Secret Technique, but he wasn’t afraid either.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1608, Aren’t You Going To Run?</h2>
<p>After a while, Xue Lian’s roars suddenly subsided, as if someone had pinched his throat and forcibly silenced him.</p>
<p>But while his roars had ceased, the rich Monster Qi surrounding Monster Mountain suddenly became turbulent, as if it had received some kind of summoning and rushed towards the cave.</p>
<p>The cave was like the open maw of a giant beast, sucking in the massive amount of Monster Qi around it. Less than ten breaths later, the rich Monster Qi that had pervaded Monster Mountain for over ten thousand years disappeared.</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned.</p>
<p>Mi Tian and Lie Feng looked at each other and seemed to be confused about the situation.</p>
<p>Inside the cave, a fierce aura slowly swelled, its strength causing Yang Kai to feel a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p><em>Sha sha sha…</em></p>
<p>The sound of footsteps came from the cave, and soon after, Xue Lian’s figure emerged from the entrance. At this moment, he no longer looked disheveled or even angry, instead displaying a thoughtful look on his face as he stretched his hands out in front of himself and seemed to be examining them carefully.</p>
<p>In the depths of his eyes, a joyful light flashed.</p>
<p>“Xue Lian, what are you doing?” Mi Tian yelled with an angry look. Right now, while they were facing off against Yang Kai, Xue Lian had suddenly begun acting so unnaturally, upsetting Mi Tian greatly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was too strong, and even with three of them there was no guarantee they could kill him, so they could not afford to make any mistakes now.</p>
<p>“He seems different from just now,” Lie Feng squinted as he stared at the entrance to the cave.</p>
<p>“We need to kill Yang Kai first! We can talk about other things later!” Mi Tian coldly snorted and once again sent his strange monster flower to attack Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Although Lie Feng felt there was something off about Xue Lian, he also knew that this was not the time to worry about such things, his figure fading away as he quietly approached Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai, however, had most of his attention focused on Xue Lian.</p>
<p>The current Xue Lian was completely different from just now, and Yang Kai felt a strong pressure coming from him!</p>
<p>Xue Lian also seemed to come back to his senses at that moment, his two blood-red eyes glancing light towards a certain spot before a strange lustre flashed across them and he called out, “Shadow Eagle lineage? Interesting, I didn’t expect to meet a descendant of my old friend right after I saw the sun again!”</p>
<p>After saying this inexplicable sentence, Xue Lian took a step forward.</p>
<p>Ignoring the barriers of space, he appeared a hundred metres away in an instant. No one saw how he moved, and even Yang Kai, who had been paying close attention to him, only noticed some clues.</p>
<p>It was not that Xue Lian had leapt over space, his speed had simply been too fast, so much so that his Divine Sense was unable to keep up.</p>
<p>Xue Lian stretched out his hand and grabbed towards empty space seemingly at will.</p>
<p>With a grasp, space suddenly solidified.</p>
<p>A flurried figure appeared at that moment: Lie Feng, who had just disappeared.</p>
<p>Lie Feng’s expression was both startled and angry. He never thought that Xue Lian would ruin his good deed and hurriedly tried to withdraw and ask what was going on.</p>
<p>However, Xue Lian did not give him such an opportunity. Inexplicably, his blood-red, scale-clad hand clenched Lie Feng’s neck!</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face changed, while Mi Tian was equally surprised.</p>
<p>Unable to care about attacking Yang Kai anymore, Mi Tian glared at Xue Lian and shouted sharply, “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>The three of them had joined forces to ambush Yang Kai, but now, while their enemy was unharmed, Xue Lian had targeted one of their own side. This was simply intolerable!</p>
<p>But Xue Lian didn’t pay any attention to Mi Tian’s interrogation and instead lifted Lie Feng up high, as if he was holding a child. Staring at him with indifferent scarlet eyes, he asked, “Who is that old bastard Tian Jiu to you?”</p>
<p>Lie Feng finally noticed that something was terribly wrong and desperately pushed his Monster Qi to free himself from Xue Lian’s control, but no matter how hard he tried, his Monster Qi seemed to be imprisoned inside his body, unable to circulate.</p>
<p>“You’re not Xue Lian!” Lie Feng exclaimed in shock.</p>
<p>It was absolutely impossible for Xue Lian to have the ability to subdue him like this. Combined with the changes in Monster Mountain’s Monster Qi, Lie Feng immediately understood what was going on.</p>
<p>“Soul possession!” Yang Kai and Mi Tian also reacted at the same time, calling out in shock.</p>
<p>“You brats have decent eyesight!” Xue Lian gave a weird laugh, not trying to deny it. Instead, he stared deeply at Yang Kai as a look of greed flashed across his eyes.</p>
<p>Yang Kai felt a shiver up his spine when he saw this, unsure what this gaze meant.</p>
<p>Xue Lian did not pay much attention to him after that though, retracted his gaze, and continued to ask, “Who is Tian Jiu to you?”</p>
<p>“My ancestor!” Lie Feng flushed and answered through clenched teeth.</p>
<p>“Is he still alive?” Xue Lian tilted his head.</p>
<p>“Ancestor fell many years ago, doesn’t Senior know?” Lie Feng asked in a deep voice.</p>
<p>When Tian Jiu was alive, he was a peak-level master on Monster Emperor Star, an extremely powerful Monster King with a Third-Order Origin King cultivation. Unfortunately, he fell thousands of years ago. Lie Feng was currently the strongest of Tian Jiu’s descendants.</p>
<p>“He actually died, such a pity, this King still had some old accounts to settle with him,” Xue Lian seemed a little disappointed, but soon grinned widely. “But that doesn’t matter, it’s all in the past. Since this King has bumped into one of that old dog’s descendants, he can just take his anger out on you.”</p>
<p>“May I ask who Senior is?” Lie Feng asked in a trembling voice. He could feel Xue Lian’s big hand squeezing harder and harder, to the point where he could barely breathe.</p>
<p>“This King and Tian Jiu were born in the same era, and have a lot of grievances between us; who do you think this King is?” Xue Lian laughed lowly.</p>
<p>Lie Feng’s face turned pale as he said, tremblingly, “You are Mad Crocodile King, the one who fell here!”</p>
<p>Lie Feng was naturally familiar with his family’s history. Over ten thousand years ago, when Heavenly Eagle King was still alive, the Shadow Eagle clan was amongst the strongest forces and almost dominated all of Monster Emperor Star. Unfortunately, there was another powerful Monster King who could fight against Heavenly Eagle King.</p>
<p>That was Mad Crocodile Monster King!</p>
<p>Hearing Xue Lian’s words, Lie Feng immediately realized his identity.</p>
<p>The one who had seized Xue Lian’s body was the bloody and brutal Mad Crocodile Monster King!</p>
<p>Rumour had it that his cultivation was earth-shaking, and due to his incredibly brutal nature, the number of Monster and Human Race masters who had died at his hands was uncountable. All of Monster Emperor Star despised him, so they called him Mad Crocodile Monster King.</p>
<p>Tian Jiu had tried to kill him many times, but never succeeded, instead just creating a deeper and deeper enmity between them.</p>
<p>One day, however, Mad Crocodile Monster King suddenly disappeared from Monster Emperor Star, with most not knowing where he had gone.</p>
<p>Chi Yue and the other Tribal Lord level characters knew that Mad Crocodile King had fallen in the Blood Prison, but the younger generation was not privy to such knowledge.</p>
<p>Now that he knew the truth, Lie Feng lost all hope!</p>
<p>Having been caught by such a Monster Race master, how could his end be good?</p>
<p>“Good, this King fell here, but this King can make a comeback starting today! Heh heh, since you are the descendant of Tian Jiu, you can only blame your bad luck for meeting this King,” Xue Lian sneered as he tightened his grip around Lie Feng’s neck viciously. With a crack, Lie Feng’s body went limp and his head fell to the side, the light in his eyes quickly dimming!</p>
<p>Lie Feng died!</p>
<p>Xue Lian was now far stronger than before!</p>
<p>Mi Tian gulped hard as his face paled.</p>
<p>Even facing Yang Kai, he had never felt so powerless, but Mad Crocodile Monster King’s terrifying reputation rendered him incapable of summoning the will to resist.</p>
<p>The moment Lie Feng died, Mi Tian did not hesitate to flee, wanting to escape from this place above all else.</p>
<p>“Without this King’s permission, you think you can leave?” Xue Lian suddenly turned to look at the location of Mi Tian and ​​casually reached out his hand, sending out a burst of strange, ethereal power.</p>
<p>The space in front of Mi Tian seemed to solidify into an iron wall, one Mi Tian slammed into and was stopped by.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes widened as he watched this scene, a vague sense of understanding suddenly coming to him.</p>
<p>The power Xue Lian used was naturally Domain! Although Xue Lian’s current aura was still just at the peak of the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, Mad Crocodile Monster King was a genuine Third-Order Origin King! It was understandable that he could still use Domain to a certain extent.</p>
<p>[So you can use this power in such a manner!] Yang Kai’s eyes shone brilliantly, seeming extremely interested in Xue Lian’s methods.</p>
<p>Mi Tian could not escape this way, so he immediately changed direction, but Xue Lian simply snorted coldly and sent out a phantom Blood Flood Dragon with a wave of his hand, which swiftly transformed into a kind of rope and flew towards Mi Tian.</p>
<p>Mi Tian roared furiously, spun around, and shot his strange flower artifact’s thousands of petals towards Xue Lian.</p>
<p>At the same time, his eyes suddenly flashed a strange brilliance as he stared directly towards Xue Lian.</p>
<p>Xue Lian showed no fear and instead just sneered contemptuously, “Soul Swallowing Evil Eye! You dare use such pathetic means to deal with this King? Boy, your overconfidence is shocking!”</p>
<p>Saying so, his scarlet eyes became deep and dark, like bottomless pits, and pulled in all of Mi Tian’s eye power.</p>
<p>A terrifying wave of Spiritual Energy also burst forth.</p>
<p>Mi Tian screamed, as if he was subjected to intolerable pain, and his entire aura rapidly deflated.</p>
<p>Not only had Mi Tian’s Evil Eye failed to play any role, Xue Lian had counterattacked and greatly damaged his Soul.</p>
<p>The blood-red rope tied around Mi Tian tightly in that instant, preventing him from escaping.</p>
<p>Xue Lian grinned, raised his hand up high, and slowly clenched his fist.</p>
<p>The blood-red rope that bound Mi Tian, following the movement of this fist, slowly tightened around Mi Tian’s body.</p>
<p>“No!” Mi Tian yelled, but to no avail. The blood-red rope quickly began crushing his physique and breaking his bones.</p>
<p>With a resounding crack, Mi Tian’s body was crushed, his flesh and blood spattering out!</p>
<p>With just a few light gestures, he had killed two of the Monster Race’s rising stars. Xue Lian looked down at his hands and a look of satisfaction appeared on his face, “Not bad, the ancient Blood Flood Dragon lineage really has its own uniqueness.”</p>
<p>He seemed to be quite satisfied with his new body.</p>
<p>But soon, he slowly shook his head, raised his eyes, and stared at Yang Kai with a fiercer gaze. His eyes were filled with greed. To him, Yang Kai’s existence seemed even more attractive!</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to run?” Xue Lian asked in a somewhat stunned voice. He had been paying attention to Yang Kai’s movements when he killed Mi Tian and Lie Feng to ensure Yang Kai did not have a chance to escape.</p>
<p>However, from start to finish, this human boy simply stood there, observing everything indifferently, not showing any intentions to flee, a fact that surprised Xue Lian greatly.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1609, Oddly Strong</h2>
<p>“Why should I run?” Yang Kai stood there with a grin and asked with his brow casually raised.</p>
<p>“You’re not afraid of death? Are you not worried this King will kill you?” Xue Lian showed an expression of interest.</p>
<p>“It is uncertain who will be the victor or deceased. Senior should be careful not to speak too confidently,” Yang Kai chuckled.</p>
<p>Xue Lian narrowed his eyes as he stared at Yang Kai earnestly for a moment before nodding, “Although I don’t want to admit it, you’re much better than those brats from my Monster Race, human. It seems my Monster Race is on the decline now.”</p>
<p>“Senior’s praise is unnecessary,” Yang Kai still remained indifferent. “But Senior does not need to keep up this act. Even if you were a Monster King ten thousand years ago, how much strength can you display right now after just seizing that body? If Senior were to suddenly come up short here, your death will be quite ugly.”</p>
<p>Xue Lian was startled briefly but soon burst into laughter, nodding in approval, “Good good, even if you know this King’s identity, you still don’t show the slightest fear and are even able to talk back in such an arrogant tone. Human boy, I praise you for your confidence. It is to the point that this King feels a little bit reluctant to kill you. Good, this King has just seized this body, and after ten thousand years of decay, cannot display anywhere near his peak strength, but… it’s still more than enough to kill you. What’s more, you must die as this King has taken a liking to the Golden Divine Dragon Source in your body. However, if you obediently hand it over, this King can grant you a swift death!”</p>
<p>“Golden Divine Dragon Source?” Yang Kai frowned, revealing a faint look. “It turns out that Senior wanted to attack me in the cave just now, no wonder I felt that something was wrong.”</p>
<p>“Your senses are sharp too!” Xue Lian snorted coldly, “Enough nonsense, surrender without a fight and this King can show mercy, but if you dare to resist…”</p>
<p>“So what if I resist?” Yang Kai snorted back, his figure flickering the moment he spoke, disappearing strangely from where he stood.</p>
<p>“This is…” Xue Lian frowned, revealing a dignified look. The moment Yang Kai disappeared, he noticed a strange power fluctuation, one that was both familiar and unfamiliar to him, but soon he identified it and exclaimed, “Space Force!”</p>
<p>Xue Lian’s eyes burst with a terrifying blood-red light as his expression twisted into one filled with excitement.</p>
<p>He hadn’t expected that this human boy’s body would contain so many treasures worth coveting.</p>
<p>Without even mentioning the Golden Divine Dragon Source, a treasure any Monster Race master would desire, just this boy’s ability to use Space Force was not something ordinary cultivators could achieve.</p>
<p>As long as he could seize this human boy’s body, whether it was the Golden Divine Dragon Source or his understanding of the Dao of Space, he could claim it all! Although his original body also inherited an ancient bloodline, it was only a diluted Variant bloodline, incomparable to a Golden Divine Dragon’s. Xue Lian felt that if he could seize Yang Kai’s body and occupy all these advantages, he may be able to reach a cultivation even higher than his previous peak!</p>
<p>“Excellent! The Heavens have graced this King!” Xue Lian laughed, his blood-red eyes filled with greed.</p>
<p>A tearing sound suddenly rang out as a half-moon-shaped Void Crack suddenly appeared a dozen or so metres in front of Xue Lian. This Void Crack was ten metres long and as soon as it formed began releasing a chaotic aura, one that made those who felt it extremely uncomfortable, as if an invisible force was trying to draw them in and exile them to the endless Void.</p>
<p>“Your mastery of the Dao of Space Force has actually reached such a level!” Xue Lian exclaimed in excitement.</p>
<p>Still, standing on the spot without moving or even evading, Xue Lian simply stretched his hand forward.</p>
<p>As he clenched his fist, the rapidly advancing crescent-shaped Void Crack suddenly seemed to be restrained by an invisible force and stopped mid-air, unable to advance any further.</p>
<p>Xue Lian frowned at that moment and pushed his Monster Qi madly, roaring angrily, “Break!”</p>
<p>After this shout, the crescent-shaped Void Crack was crushed by him and the surrounding distorted space began to twist and repair itself.</p>
<p><em>Huala…</em></p>
<p>A slight noise came from the soles of Xue Lian’s feet, and a small grey figure leapt out of the ground before swinging down a jet-black stick it was carrying.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Xue Lian was taken aback. Even with his sharp senses, he was unable to notice any trace of this creature approaching him. It wasn’t until this figure emerged from the ground that Xue Lian was even aware of its presence.</p>
<p>Looking at this newly appeared figure, it was clear it wasn’t a creature but instead a human-shaped rock.</p>
<p>It was quite small, only about half the size of any ordinary person.</p>
<p>However, the black stick it held in both hands had a force behind its swing that frightened Xue Lian greatly!</p>
<p>If this stick hit him, Xue Lian was certain he would suffer.</p>
<p>His face sank and a cold snort left his throat as Xue Lian released a blood-red mist from his body that seemed to have a mind of its own and rapidly condensed into a protective layer around him.</p>
<p>The pitch-black struck in the next instant.</p>
<p>A loud crack sounded as Xue Lian’s defence was unable to withstand the power of this blow and broke, allowing the black stick to slam down at him unabated.</p>
<p>Xue Lian’s complexion finally changed as he once again displayed his Flood Dragon Transformation to cover his arms in blood-red scales and throw out a fierce punch to meet this stick. This punch not only contained enormous physical power but also a strange aura.</p>
<p>Domain!</p>
<p><em>Hong…</em></p>
<p>Blood-coloured and black light collided to create a dazzling explosive halo. Xue Lian’s figure was directly smashed into the ground while Xiao Xiao was also sent flying, landing with a thud some distance away. Quickly shaking his head though, Xiao Xiao stood up, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>A sharp bird cry rang out at that moment as a strange giant flaming bird manifested high up above.</p>
<p>Flapping its wings, the Firebird Artifact Spirit opened its beak and sprayed out a barrage of burning hot fireballs towards Xue Lian’s position.</p>
<p>Xue Lian’s roar instantly sounded along with the echoes of exploding fireballs!</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s figure appeared like a ghost at this time and dove straight down from the sky. The Verdant Dragon Bone Sword was already in his hand and a giant dark green dragon appeared as he poured his Saint Qi into it, opened its gaping maw, and rushed towards Xue Lian, as if it wanted to swallow him whole!</p>
<p>Yang Kai had used almost all his cards at this moment, not showing any intention of holding back.</p>
<p>His opponent’s strength was unfathomable and Yang Kai would naturally not regard him as a common Origin Returning Realm master.</p>
<p>The giant dark green dragon ferociously hit the ground, sending out a massive shockwave. Yang Kai then ejected hundreds of Golden Blood Threads to madly slice through the surrounding space.</p>
<p>“Boy, you court death!” Xue Lian roared furiously. He never expected he would suffer such a big loss at Yang Kai’s hands just after seeing the sun again after thousands of years.</p>
<p>He thought Yang Kai was no different from Mi Tian or Lie Feng, who he had easily killed just now. He had severely underestimated Yang Kai’s abilities.</p>
<p>Releasing his Domain, Xue Lian stopped all the fireballs dropping towards him ten metres outside his body, causing all of them to burst. At the same time, he punched away the giant dark green dragon, sending it flying. As for Yang Kai’s Golden Blood Threads, they didn’t have much effect, leaving only shallow scars on the surface of Xue Lian’s body.</p>
<p>After being taken over, Xue Lian’s strength had massively increased.</p>
<p>Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and stretched out his hand, summoning his Purple Shield to defend his body.</p>
<p>The next moment, a blood-red giant fist bombarded the shield.</p>
<p><em>Bang…</em></p>
<p>After following Yang Kai for many years, the Origin Grade High-Rank defensive artifact that had been repaired and refined several times by Yang Yan was completely shattered.</p>
<p>The destruction of the Purple Shield slowed the destructive power of Xue Lian’s punch, allowing Yang Kai a chance to intercept it with one of his own.</p>
<p>When the two fists collided, Yang Kai only felt an incredible impact he was unable to resist. As hot liquid filled his throat, Yang Kai was sent flying a few thousand metres before managing to stabilize his figure.</p>
<p>After standing firm, Yang Kai spat out a mouthful of blood before staring forward fixedly.</p>
<p>In the direction he stared, with the dust clearing, Yang Kai saw a dishevelled Xue Lian glaring back at him with a hideous and terrifying expression.</p>
<p>He seemed to have become truly enraged.</p>
<p>Yang Kai grinned widely as his nerves settled.</p>
<p>Just now, although he seemed to be going all out, Yang Kai was actually making a careful but forceful probe.</p>
<p>Now that he obtained the desired result, he was naturally happy.</p>
<p>Xue Lian wasn’t invincible!</p>
<p>He was wary of the Heaven Shaking Pillar held by Xiao Xiao, Yang Kai’s Golden Blood Threads, the Verdant Dragon Bone Sword, and the Firebird Artifact Spirit!</p>
<p>All of Yang Kai’s means could cause him harm!</p>
<p>This was enough. Yang Kai had been worried that no matter how hard he tried, Xue Lian would remain unharmed. If that was really the case, he would have immediately fled. If he couldn’t break his opponent’s defences, what point would there be in fighting?</p>
<p>As Yang Kai’s mind turned sharply, Xue Lian’s furious expression abated significantly, as if he became aware of something and a look of dread flashed across his eyes.</p>
<p>He finally understood the situation he was in clearly. Yang Kai was very different from Lie Feng and Mi Tian and not an existence he could kill at will.</p>
<p>This little brat was oddly strong!</p>
<p>Sweeping his eyes solemnly over the Firebird, Stone Puppet, and giant dark green dragon, Xue Lian suddenly shouted, “Boy, you are truly impressive! Since you cultivate Space Force, this King is not confident he can kill you! En, how about we make a deal? Leave behind this King’s Origin Essence Crystal and we can shake hands and make peace, from now on not interfering with one another!”</p>
<p>“You want that Origin Essence Crystal?” Yang Kai grinned.</p>
<p>“Yes, that is this King’s core, this King naturally cannot give it away.”</p>
<p>“In your dreams!” Yang Kai laughed, “The Origin Essence Crystal is mine now, there’s no way I will return it. If you want it, come get it yourself.”</p>
<p>“Boy, don’t refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit! This King appreciates your talent and does not want to bully the weak, don’t make the mistake of embarrassing yourself here.”</p>
<p>“Really? Why does it sound more like Senior is lacking in confidence? Don’t you want my Golden Divine Dragon Source? If you kill me, everything is yours, why bother wasting so much breath here?”</p>
<h2>Chapter 1610, Send You On Your Way</h2>
<p>Xue Lian’s face sank, “Boy, are you really not going to give this King face?”</p>
<p>“What thing are you?” Yang Kai smiled contemptuously.</p>
<p>“Good, you are one of the few who dare talk to this King like this other than that old ghost Tian Jiu, but you will die here today so, it matters not!” Xue Lian roared and released a blood-red mist from his body, enveloping him to the point where his figure disappeared and only a cloud of blood remained.</p>
<p>Immediately, this blood cloud flew forward at an extremely fast speed and enveloped Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Inside this blood mist, a terrifying and astonishing energy fluctuation broke out as blood-red rays shot towards Yang Kai like a living creature, trying to entangle him.</p>
<p>At the same time, a mysterious power surged around him.</p>
<p>Yang Kai suddenly felt that moving became difficult and the Saint Qi in his body was slightly suppressed.</p>
<p>Domain!</p>
<p>Yang Kai released his Shi madly, causing the surrounding space to twist and collapse.</p>
<p>However, his Shi was completely suppressed by Xue Lian’s Domain and could only extend a finger length outside his body.</p>
<p>“Your Shi is close to the grand accomplishment stage!” Xue Lian commented in surprise, “You have the capital to back up your arrogance, boy. A mere Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation, yet Shi condensed to such a level, however… you’re still not good enough!”</p>
<p>With a wide grin, Xue Lian released a large amount of Blood Qi filled with malice from his body, transformed it into flood dragons, and sent them hurtling towards Yang Kai from all directions.</p>
<p>This Evil Qi was filled with Mad Crocodile Monster King’s malevolent aura, and an average cultivator that was contaminated with it would immediately become deranged.</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai did not completely understand the mysteries behind this attack, how could he just stand there and allow it to get close?</p>
<p>Hundreds of Golden Blood Threads flew out from his body, like hundreds of tiny arms, waving and shuttling about his figure.</p>
<p>The pressure from Xue Lian’s Domain was instantly reduced!</p>
<p>Golden Blood Threads had the miraculous ability to cut apart Shi. Domain was an evolved form of Shi, so these Golden Blood Threads were able to restrain it somewhat. One or two may not have been enough to make a difference, but with hundreds working together, they could display some positive effects.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s Shi spread a metre beyond his skin in an instant.</p>
<p>With a wave of his hand, the giant dark-green dragon transformed into a green glow and flew back to his hand, assuming its normal Dragon Bone Sword shape.</p>
<p>A loud dragon roar sounded from the sword as Yang Kai held it in one hand, poured his Saint Qi into it, and swung it forward.</p>
<p>A green sword wave tore through space and ripped the blood-red aura around him in half before soaring towards Xue Lian who was still hidden inside the blood mist.</p>
<p>Xue Lian could not ignore this attack and was forced to dodge, but before he could regain his stance, a burly figure suddenly emerged from the ground.</p>
<p>Stone Puppet!</p>
<p>The Stone Puppet at this moment suddenly transformed into a stone giant while the Heaven Shaking Pillar in its hand also grew to a terrifying size, nearly five metres long. The jet-black stick carried a Heaven destroying and Earth-shattering momentum with it that caught Xue Lian off guard as it smashed towards him.</p>
<p>Xue Lian was stunned and did not dare take a blow from the Heaven Shaking Pillar, so with a flicker of his figure, he dodged once more while simultaneously sending out a fierce punch.</p>
<p>There was a terrifying power contained in the fist that struck the Stone Puppet’s chest.</p>
<p>With a bang, Xiao Xiao was forced back several steps and several stone chips blew off from his chest.</p>
<p>The Stone Puppet was obviously taken aback.</p>
<p>Since its birth, it had never been hurt by anyone; today was the first time!</p>
<p>Even if it was only a few stone chips, it was still an injury.</p>
<p>Xiao Xiao’s round eyes suddenly filled with a ferocious light as it stretched out its free hand and pounded its chest loudly. Immediately after, the Stone Puppet’s body filled with a shocking, blazing hot energy.</p>
<p>A hot aura burst from Xiao Xiao’s body, one seemingly capable of burning all creation.</p>
<p>The body of the Stone Puppet also seemed to melt, and its entire figure turned fiery red!</p>
<p>Yang Kai was dumbfounded, not knowing what happened to Xiao Xiao. He had never seen such a change in the Stone Puppet before and fell back in a flurry to avoid a frontal confrontation with Xue Lian so he could pay close attention to Xiao Xiao’s condition.</p>
<p>He was not sure whether this sudden change was good or bad for the Stone Puppet.</p>
<p>Soon, the Stone Puppet’s body had become covered in a molten magma-like substance.</p>
<p>At a glance, it appeared like Xiao Xiao was now wearing a lava armour! The heat radiating from this lava armour was so intense that even Yang Kai did not dare to approach easily.</p>
<p>“Sun’s True Fire!” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>He felt the aura of the Sun’s True Fire coming from this lava armour!</p>
<p>In a flash, Yang Kai suddenly understood.</p>
<p>Xiao Xiao had swallowed the Sun’s True Essence many years ago, but since then, he had never used this power; as a result, even Yang Kai did not know he was capable of this.</p>
<p>But today, Xue Lian’s punch undoubtedly infuriated the Stone Puppet and forced him to utilize his full strength!</p>
<p>Wearing his lava armour, Xiao Xiao suddenly transformed into a lava giant, and while carrying the unbelievably heavy Heaven Shaking Pillar in one hand, he clenched his other into a fist as a fiendish grin appeared on his always simple and honest looking face, a strange sight indeed.</p>
<p><em>Deng deng deng…</em></p>
<p>Xiao Xiao charged forward into the cloud of blood mist without fear, swinging his huge burning fist towards Xue Lian.</p>
<p>Xue Lian let out a strange roar as the thick blood mist rapidly became thin, as if it was being evaporated by the power of the Sun’s True Fire.</p>
<p>After a couple dozen punches, Xue Lian’s figure was exposed again.</p>
<p>His complexion was blue as he stared at the lava giant that was constantly approaching him with great dread, and his eyes filled with a look of shock.</p>
<p>Even with his vast knowledge, he had never even heard of a creature like the one in front of him now.</p>
<p>The first time it attacked him, it was only half the height of a regular person, looking quite small and delicate. The second time it attacked it had suddenly grown into a mighty giant. Now, it seemed to have transformed again into a giant made from molten lava.</p>
<p>Xue Lian retreated again and again, not daring to meet Xiao Xiao head-on.</p>
<p>The Firebird took advantage of this situation to launch a new barrage of fireballs</p>
<p>These fireballs not only contained scorching heat but also arcs of lightning.</p>
<p>The Firebird had also swallowed several Sun’s True Fire wisps, allowing it to achieve incredible growth. It had also swallowed several Heaven Scorching Thunder Fires, which let its flames take on a violent Thunder Attribute aura.</p>
<p>Its flames were even more terrifying than the Stone Puppet’s, and what it lacked compared to Xiao Xiao’s sheer power, it made up for in agility and flexibility.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s two great helpers, one on the ground and the other in the sky, joined forces to completely suppress Xue Lian.</p>
<p>Yang Kai could not help grinning.</p>
<p>With the Firebird and Stone Puppet alone, Xue Lian could not act freely. Even if he had been a Monster King ten thousand years ago and could even still use a bit of his Domain, his current body greatly limited his strength in the end.</p>
<p>If he had been at his peak, Xue Lian would have been able to deal with Yang Kai with a wave of his hand.</p>
<p>Any Third-Order Origin King was not to be trifled with.</p>
<p>However, a great dragon trapped in a shallow pond could not create any big waves.</p>
<p>“Scram!” In a distressed state, Xue Lian roared and sent a fierce punch towards the Stone Puppet, the huge force behind it forcing Xiao Xiao back a hundred metres or so.</p>
<p>However, Xue Lian’s fist was also severely burnt as a result.</p>
<p>In the next instant, he charged forward, dodging the Firebird’s bombardment, and leapt straight towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was the key to this battle. So long as Yang Kai was killed, the Stone Puppet and Firebird that listened to his orders wouldn’t be able to cause Xue Lian any trouble. As such, he made up his mind to launch an attack with his full strength in hopes of executing Yang Kai in a single blow.</p>
<p>Domain surged forth, consuming Yang Kai as Xue Lian pounced forth.</p>
<p>Yang Kai pushed his Shi madly to resist this Domain, but it was clearly being overwhelmed and was soon suppressed back into his body.</p>
<p>Xue Lian closed in, a fiendish look upon his face as he roared madly.</p>
<p>This roar was piercing like a sword that sank into the heart of anyone who heard it, penetrating Yang Kai’s Soul and causing his movements to freeze up.</p>
<p>“Boy, you’re dead!” Xue Lian yelled frantically as he reached out to grab Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Oh really?” A strange smile suddenly appeared on Yang Kai’s face as his body suddenly shook and a low growl erupted from his throat, “Dragon Transformation!”</p>
<p>A glorious golden light burst forth as golden scales suddenly emerged from Yang Kai’s right arm, covering his skin in a kind of impenetrable armour.</p>
<p>Golden light flashed from his hand as it transformed into a giant dragon claw.</p>
<p>The overwhelming aura of a Divine Dragon filled the air.</p>
<p>Xue Lian’s eyes instinctively flashed with fear and his seemingly unstoppable momentum rapidly deflated.</p>
<p>The pressure of an Ancient Divine Spirit had a suppressive effect on any Monster Race, let alone the ruler of those Divine Spirits!</p>
<p>Whether it was Xue Lian’s body or Mad Crocodile Monster King’s Soul, both were distant descendants of Variant Ancient Divine Spirits, incomparable to a Golden Divine Dragon.</p>
<p>Yang Kai struck with his right hand; his five fingers grouped together like a sharp sword he thrust out fiercely.</p>
<p>A splash sounded.</p>
<p>Xue Lian’s body, which seemed as solid as iron, was directly pierced by Yang Kai’s right hand like it was tofu.</p>
<p>A beating sound echoed from Xue Lian’s chest as Yang Kai’s right hand gripped his heart.</p>
<p>Xue Lian froze in place, his big hand which was grabbing towards Yang Kai’s head stopped motionless mid-air, his eyes trembling violently.</p>
<p>“Let me send you on your way!” Yang Kai grinned and squeezed his right hand, directly crushing Xue Lian’s heart.</p>
<p>“Boy, you’re still too naive!” Xue Lian laughed strangely before he died, the light in his eyes fading after his heart was crushed.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s complexion darkened as he faintly realized that something was wrong. Just as he was about to pull out his arm though, he saw a blood-red light suddenly fly out from Xue Lian’s forehead and without pause, rush directly into his head.</p>
<p>This blood-red light radiated an extremely strange aura, one that broke through Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea defences as easily as crushing dry weeds or smashing rotten wood.</p>
<p>“So that’s what you were plotting!” Yang Kai immediately understood and immediately sent his consciousness into his Knowledge Sea.</p>
<p>Inside his Knowledge Sea, the flames of his Conflagrated Knowledge Sea tumbled.</p>
<p>A strange figure stood mid-air, looking at everything around him in shock and surprise.</p>
<p>He found that his situation was a little different from what he had imagined!</p>
<p>“If you planned on seizing my body, I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint you,” Yang Kai looked at the strange figure and sneered.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1611, Extinguish Your Soul</h2>
<p>Mad Crocodile Monster King had never regarded Xue Lian’s body as important.</p>
<p>He had pretended to launch a desperation attack on Yang Kai in order to get close enough to break into the latter’s Knowledge Sea with his Soul Avatar the moment Yang Kai relaxed his guard. From there, Mad Crocodile’s plan was to seize Yang Kai’s body.</p>
<p>His plan had succeeded so far!</p>
<p>His Soul Avatar had crashed into Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea as he had planned, and now, all he needed to do to occupy Yang Kai’s body and enjoy the many treasures it held was to swallow Yang Kai’s Soul Avatar.</p>
<p>Mad Crocodile was confident he could accomplish this last part. Although his Spiritual Energy had continued to weaken for the past ten thousand years, almost to the point where his Soul was about to dissipate, a thin camel was still bigger than a horse, and his Spiritual Energy was not something an ordinary Origin Returning Realm boy could contend with.</p>
<p>If this wasn’t the case, he would not have been able to possess Xue Lian’s body in such a short time.</p>
<p>After all, Xue Lian was also an elite among Origin Realm cultivators.</p>
<p>However, when he broke into this scorching hot Knowledge Sea, Mad Crocodile immediately had a bad premonition.</p>
<p>“You actually have a Mutated Knowledge Sea!” Mad Crocodile exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Indeed,” Yang Kai looked at him lightly, not rushing to take action, his hands folded and his tone indifferent, as if he was just chatting with a friend.</p>
<p>Mad Crocodile frowned as he looked around, but soon his eyes were attracted to a certain seven coloured island at the centre of Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea. In an instant, his eyes bulged as disbelief filled his face. Pointing his trembling finger, Mad Crocodile hesitantly asked, “Is this the legendary Soul Warming Lotus?”</p>
<p>“Senior knows about the Soul Warming Lotus?” Yang Kai was surprised.</p>
<p>Mad Crocodile’s face sank, “This King has drunk more water than you have crossed over. How could this King not know about a Supreme Treasure like the Soul Warming Lotus?”</p>
<p>This boy actually possessed a Soul Warming Lotus! What’s more it was a fully evolved Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus.</p>
<p>With this kind of Supreme Treasure nurturing it, it wasn’t surprising that this boy’s Soul was unusually strong and that his Spiritual Energy was so rich. It was said that this Supreme Treasure would constantly nourish and strengthen its owner’s Soul. In a short time, it may not yield much effect, but as time passed, its effect would be astonishing.</p>
<p>It could save a cultivator countless years of hard work!</p>
<p>Ten thousand years ago, when Mad Crocodile was still alive, he had naturally heard about the Soul Warming Lotus, but unfortunately he had never seen one. Now, unexpectedly, he was able to witness this treasure with his own eyes after trying to seize Yang Kai’s body.</p>
<p>The only question was whether this boy managed to obtain this Soul Warming Lotus in its seven coloured form, or if he had managed to grow it to this point on his own.</p>
<p>The former possibility seemed more likely though! Evolving a Soul Warming Lotus was said to be extremely difficult, so how could it be possible for such a young boy to cultivate one to its final seven coloured form?</p>
<p>[This boy’s luck is too Heaven-defying!] Mad Crocodile thought to himself.</p>
<p>Mad Crocodile was a Monster King, so his aptitude and bloodline were naturally extraordinary. On top of that, he had many fortuitous encounters across his life and managed to achieve his peak strength after many years of hard work, but when he compared himself to Yang Kai, his own opportunities seemed like complete trash.</p>
<p>After staring at the seven coloured island greedily, he took a deep breath, as if to calm his excitement, turned his head, stared at Yang Kai solemnly, and shouted loudly, “Boy, this King truly looked down upon you. It seems what will follow will be a bitter struggle, all that is uncertain now is in the end, whether you die or I perish!”</p>
<p>The power of this boy’s Soul wasn’t below his own, and with the support of the Soul Warming Lotus, Mad Crocodile Monster King didn’t have complete confidence he could consume Yang Kai’s Soul Avatar.</p>
<p>He now regarded this boy as an equal opponent he needed to confront head-on.</p>
<p>“I think the latter possibility is much higher actually,” hearing this declaration, Yang Kai could only chuckle, his expression calm and relaxed, displaying complete confidence, as if he didn’t even put Mad Crocodile Monster King in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Don’t get too cocky, boy! It’s time you learned a painful lesson, lest you continue to underestimate this world’s heroes.”</p>
<p>“You don’t believe me?” Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at Mad Crocodile with a sneer, “Forget it, I have no time for nonsense with you. The sooner you die, the sooner this will be over.”</p>
<p>Saying so, Yang Kai stretched out his hand and pointed to the sky.</p>
<p>Mad Crocodile didn’t know what Yang Kai was doing and looked up suspiciously.</p>
<p>A strange oval-shaped object with a long slit running horizontally across its centre appeared up above, looking like a closed eye, radiating a profound and mystical aura.</p>
<p>But with a snap of Yang Kai’s finger, this slit slowly began to open.</p>
<p>Soon, a brilliant golden light flashed.</p>
<p>This golden light became more and more intense until finally it formed a beam of light which shot out and covered Mad Crocodile Monster King’s Soul Avatar.</p>
<p>Contained within the golden light there was also a multi-coloured radiance!</p>
<p>As soon as this beam of light enveloped Mad Crocodile Monster King’s Soul Avatar, he was instantly frozen in place, unable to move, as if he was completely restrained.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Mad Crocodile exclaimed in horror.</p>
<p>As soon as he was struck by this golden light, he realized that something was terribly wrong. Instantly, he felt as if his consciousness was melting away, like snowflakes exposed to the scorching sun. This discovery shocked Mad Crocodile, and he fought desperately to resist.</p>
<p>The golden and multi-coloured light began to disperse, seemingly not capable of completely restraining Mad Crocodile Monster King.</p>
<p>Yang Kai raised his brow and revealed a slightly surprised look.</p>
<p>The Demon Eye of Annihilation was one of Great Demon God’s Divine Abilities and was capable of producing a golden ray of light that could completely extinguish an enemy’s Soul. This powerful technique had been used by Yang Kai countless times and never had any difficulty in the past.</p>
<p>Although Great Demon God only reached the Saint King Realm before he died, he was an extraordinary genius and this Divine Ability he created only grew in power as Yang Kai’s cultivation increased.</p>
<p>What’s more, the current Soul destroying golden light had been merged together with the Coloured Glass Divine Light’s power.</p>
<p>Coloured Glass Divine Light was able to suppress an opponent’s Soul, so when combined with the extinguishing power of the golden light, both dramatically increased one another’s power.</p>
<p>Even so, Mad Crocodile Monster King’s Soul apparently couldn’t be wiped out in one fell swoop, showing just how pure and powerful his Spiritual Essence was.</p>
<p>But this was also understandable; after all, Mad Crocodile was a Monster King level master, if he could be so easily killed, that would truly be strange.</p>
<p>Yang Kai grinned wickedly as his thoughts flashed and the tumbling, roaring flames down below swelled up and from all directions and transformed into a massive wave that crashed towards Mad Crocodile’s Soul Avatar .</p>
<p>In an instant, the place where Mad Crocodile was located was enveloped by burning hot Spiritual Energy.</p>
<p>“No!” Mad Crocodile roared as he struggled to resist the sea of flames, releasing one powerful Soul Skill after another.</p>
<p>“Mad Crocodile, I am the master here! You daring to come here was nothing short of digging your own grave!” Yang Kai shouted as he pushed his Spiritual Energy even more ferociously.</p>
<p>The combined assault of Yang Kai’s Golden Light, Coloured Glass Divine Light, and Conflagrated Spiritual Energy caused his Knowledge Sea to tumble violently.</p>
<p>Mad Crocodile’s roars continued to echo, but no matter how hard he struggled to resist, he still couldn’t escape the golden light. Under the golden light, his Soul was being scattered at an extremely terrifying speed and his aura rapidly grew weak.</p>
<p>Soon, Mad Crocodile’s cries weakened and his resistance grew less intense.</p>
<p>Not long after, everything fell silent, and after Yang Kai waved his hand to calm the tumbling Spiritual Energy and take back the power of his Demon Eye of Annihilation, what was left, floating high up in the sky above his Knowledge Sea, was a mass of pure Spiritual Energy where Mad Crocodile’s Soul was completely extinguished!</p>
<p>Looking at the mass of energy, Yang Kai’s eyes burned.</p>
<p>This was what was left after Mad Crocodile’s Soul had been purified, and it contained his understanding of the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao as well as his insight into Domain!</p>
<p>This was a Third-Order Origin King master’s lifetime worth of cultivation experience!</p>
<p>Its value was immeasurable.</p>
<p>If he could cleanly absorb this mass Spiritual Energy, Yang Kai knew he would experience tremendous growth and very possibly save himself many years of hard work.</p>
<p>Thinking so, Yang Kai sent his consciousness back to his body and began sweeping his eyes around. Walking over to the dead Xue Lian and the other dead Monster Race rising stars, Yang Kai collected their Monster Cores and Space Rings, used his Demonic Flames to burn their bodies to ashes, then turned around and flew back into the dark cave.</p>
<p>Xue Lian, Mi Tian, and ​​Lie Feng were all extremely famous and powerful Origin Returning Realm masters on Monster Emperor Star, representing what was essentially the highest combat strength in the Origin Realm.</p>
<p>Their Monster Cores were naturally extremely valuable.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t use their corpses to condense Blood Beasts as, with his current methods, he had no need for such means to confront his enemies.</p>
<p>Three Monster Cores equivalent to those of peak Ninth-Order Monster Beasts, if used well as Pill Spirits, could definitely allow Yang Kai to refine three Origin King Grade Spirit Pills!</p>
<p>He decided to use these three Monster Cores to refine particularly precious pills as Monster Cores of this grade were quite rare.</p>
<p>Inside the cave, Yang Kai sat down cross-legged then began savouring the taste of the mass of Spiritual Energy he had obtained, his expression changing between exhilaration joy, shock, and wonder.</p>
<p>A hundred kilometres outside the Blood Prison, inside a stone pavilion.</p>
<p>Luo Hai sat motionlessly with closed eyes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he was focusing his Divine Sense to cover the entire Blood Prison.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t perceive anything inside too clearly, he could still get a general idea of what was happening.</p>
<p>Right now though, all of his focus was on Monster Mountain.</p>
<p>It seemed he had discovered something amazing and, since half an hour ago, his body had been trembling slightly and a great storm had been surging in the depths of his heart.</p>
<p>Because of the request of the old woman surnamed Lei and the others, he had been paying more attention to Yang Kai’s movements.</p>
<p>When Yang Kai entered Monster Mountain, Luo Hai had naturally noticed it, as well as the changes that followed.</p>
<p>In particular, the disappearance of the aura of the Origin Essence Crystal which was hidden on Monster Mountain caught his attention.</p>
<p>That Origin Essence Crystal had sat there for over ten thousand years, undisturbed, but not long after Yang Kai entered Monster Mountain, its aura had vanished. What this meant, Luo Hai naturally understood immediately.</p>
<p>The Origin Essence Crystal had been taken away by Yang Kai!</p>
<p>That was a treasure that even Luo Hai greatly coveted. He concealed the deep excitement in his heart, without showing the slightest hint of disturbance on his face so as not to alert the others around him, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t constantly thinking about this treasure now.</p>
<p>A Monster King master had left that Origin Essence Crystal there after his death, and Luo Hai was not about to let it slip through his fingers as it was the key to him breaking through to the Third-Order Origin King Realm.</p>
<p>It was not just that Monster King that had dropped Origin Essence Crystals. Two other fallen Third-Order Origin King masters produced Origin Essence Crystals upon their deaths in that great war all those years ago. However, those two Origin Essence Crystals had already been taken, leaving only the Origin Essence Crystal of that Monster King, which was difficult to retrieve.</p>
<p>The rich Monster Qi enveloping Monster Mountain made no Human Race Origin Returning Realm cultivator dare to break in easily.</p>
<p>This time, however, someone had finally succeeded, so how could Luo Hai let him off?</p>
<h2>Chapter 1612, Youth</h2>
<p>Luo Hai already regarded the Origin Essence Crystal as something in his pocket!</p>
<p>However, he had the capital to back up such self-confidence as he was the Star Master of Green Mountains Star. As long as Yang Kai was still on Green Mountains Star, he could never escape his control.</p>
<p>When the time came, all he had to do was find this boy and ask him to hand over the Origin Essence Crystal; afterwards, he would give him some benefits and everyone would be satisfied.</p>
<p>If this boy wanted, Luo Hai was even prepared to accept him as a disciple!</p>
<p>This was the greatest honour and opportunity that one asked for.</p>
<p>Luo Hai had not been so excited in many years and was almost unable to keep up appearances! If not for him worrying about the other Origin Kings inside the stone pavilion seeing some kind of flaw, he would have already burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“Sir Luo Hai, the Blood Prison will close in ten days, right?” The old woman surnamed Lei suddenly asked.</p>
<p>“En,” Luo Hai nodded, “There is only ten days left, after which, the Domain inside the Blood Prison will erupt and force those little fellows out.”</p>
<p>“Haha, I wonder what kind of gains they’ll have this time. By the way, is that little Second-Order Origin Realm boy safe and sound?”</p>
<p>When Yang Kai was asked about, everyone opened their eyes and looked at Luo Hai, apparently quite concerned with the former’s condition.</p>
<p>“There’s no problem, this King can sense he’s still alive. You don’t have to worry about his safety.”</p>
<p>“Great, as long as he can walk out alive, this old lady will invite him to join Sword Union immediately!” The old woman was overjoyed.</p>
<p>“This boy has a boundless future. Although there are always some Second-Order Origin Returning Realm Juniors who don’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth and enter the Blood Prison, none ever survive while most fall within a few days. If he can emerge safely, his future will certainly be bright!”</p>
<p>“This old master can’t wait to see this little boy and find out what kind of background he has.”</p>
<p>“En, looking at his performance, the Star Field must have a place for him in the future.”</p>
<p>Everyone was speaking extremely highly of Yang Kai while Luo Hai simply smiled without interrupting. Only he understood how much more extraordinary Yang Kai was than everyone had thought.</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>Inside the cave on Monster Mountain, Yang Kai had completely immersed himself in his comprehension and had lost track of the passage of time.</p>
<p>At a certain point, however, he frowned slightly and opened his eyes.</p>
<p>He noticed a faint change in the atmosphere of the Blood Prison as well as a trace of Domain suddenly appearing where he was on Monster Mountain.</p>
<p>Before coming here, Chi Yue had said that once the aura inside the Blood Prison changes, he must leave immediately, otherwise he would die without burial.</p>
<p>When this kind of change occurred, within five days, the entire Blood Prison would become a Restricted Area that no one could set foot into, filled with chaotic Domains that would not subside again until a thousand years later.</p>
<p>[It is time to leave!]</p>
<p>Slowly getting up and inspecting his gains, Yang Kai grinned widely.</p>
<p>He felt that his understanding of Shi had become much deeper and he was only one step away from the grand accomplishment stage. This step seemed very close but also far away, as if there was some kind of shackle holding him back from reaching it.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t a big deal. After absorbing the remnant Spiritual Energy of Mad Crocodile Monster King, as long as he thoroughly digested the insights it contained, it wouldn’t be difficult for Yang Kai to reach the grand accomplishment stage in Shi.</p>
<p>Also, as soon as he broke through to the Origin King Realm, forming his own Domain would undoubtedly be easier.</p>
<p>This kind of benefit was something beyond Yang Kai’s reach until now and could only be realized once he reached the Origin King Realm.</p>
<p>Walking out of the cave, Yang Kai took a moment to orient himself before he shot off in a flash of light.</p>
<p>Two days later, in a small valley, Yang Kai appeared leisurely.</p>
<p>“Boy, you’re here!” A figure suddenly flashed from the side and landed in front of Yang Kai, looking at him with a smile.</p>
<p>“Senior Ba He!” Yang Kai turned and nodded to him.</p>
<p>“Brat, I thought you’d died after we didn’t hear from you for so long!” Yu Xiong appeared suddenly and greeted Yang Kai grimly, looking him up and down to see if he was missing any arms or legs.</p>
<p>“Yang Kai!” Shan Qing Luo smiled winningly and landed directly beside him, taking his arm.</p>
<p>Xue Sun appeared immediately after Shan Qing Luo, but only nodded faintly to Yang Kai without much expression.</p>
<p>“Seems like you’re all here,” Yang Kai smiled slightly.</p>
<p>“Did you accomplish that task Adoptive Mother gave you?” Yu Xiong walked over to Yang Kai and asked curiously.</p>
<p>Yang Kai stretched out his hand and wiped his Space Ring, taking out a round crystal-like object and tossed it to Yu Xiong.</p>
<p>Yu Xiong caught it nervously and carefully observed it.</p>
<p>In an instant, everyone’s eyes were drawn to this pure crystal, their eyes growing extremely hot.</p>
<p>“This is… an Origin Essence Crystal?” Ba He gulped hard as he stared at the Origin Essence Crystal without blinking. Even the most indifferent Xue Sun had her breathing turn rapid.</p>
<p>“It’s not fake, right?” Yu Xiong looked up at Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” Yang Kai snickered.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t look like it!” Yu Xiong shook his head then hurriedly took out a jade box from his Space Ring before carefully storing the Origin Essence Crystal into it and putting it away. He then turned to look at Yang Kai with a somewhat complex expression and said, “Little brat, you’re certainly decisive enough. En, this is the second half of the Monster Transformation Secret Art that Adoptive Mother gave me to hold onto.”</p>
<p>Saying so, he tossed something that looked like an ancient book towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai caught it then began flipping through it quickly. After confirming that there were no problems with it, he nodded and said, “I’ve completed the task assigned to me by Senior Chi Yue, now that I’ve handed that thing over to you, it has nothing to do with me anymore.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” Yu Xiong grinned, “With so many of us, we aren’t afraid we will lose it.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t say anymore on this subject and instead turned to look at Shan Qing Luo and whispered, “Come with me, I have something to say to you.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Shan Qing Luo nodded and walked off a short distance with Yang Kai.</p>
<p>As if realizing what was about to happen, Shan Qing Luo’s mood suddenly became a little depressed.</p>
<p>Everything around her suddenly lost colour and became bleak.</p>
<p>Yang Kai and Shan Qing Luo stared at each other as a reluctant atmosphere filled the space between them.</p>
<p>After a long silence, Yang Kai sighed and asked, “I met some guys before that seemed to have fought with you. One of them even said he hurt you, are you alright?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine, my Saint Qi was only disturbed a bit by his attack, he didn’t even cause a minor wound,” Shan Qing Luo slowly shook her head. “Are they dead?”</p>
<p>After having met Yang Kai, it would be strange if that group was still alive.</p>
<p>“En.”</p>
<p>“You’re much stronger than me now. When we were back in the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land before, I was the one protecting you,” Shan Qing Luo laughed lightly.</p>
<p>It had only been a few dozen years, yet the fledgling boy she met that day had already walked ahead of her, and that was even after she obtained the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider’s Source.</p>
<p>“Back then… things were quite good,” Yang Kai’s eyes showed a look of remembrance and his smile became ambiguous.</p>
<p>Shan Qing Luo clearly understood what he was referring to and gave him an amorous look.</p>
<p>“Are you going back to Monster Emperor Star?” Yang Kai asked suddenly.</p>
<p>“Adoptive Mother has been very good to me, I can’t just leave her like this,” Shan Qing Luo’s expression instantly saddened, “Moreover, I don’t want to burden you in the future. I am now a Half-Monster Race, and Monster Emperor Star is the most suitable place for me to cultivate. If I leave with you, I will only become a burden to you later, I don’t want that!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai made her feel a great sense of pressure, and if she wanted to walk beside him from now on, she could not settle for temporary satisfaction. Shan Qing Luo knew this better than anyone else.</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded slightly to express his understanding.</p>
<p>He had considered all of this long ago, so when Shan Qing Luo said it out loud, he wasn’t surprised at all.</p>
<p>“What about you? Are you leaving?”</p>
<p>“En,” Yang Kai smiled lightly, “I picked up the people from the Central Capital and Tong Xuan Realm and will be taking them to a Cultivation Star called Shadowed Star, which is very remote. If there is a chance, I will come to Monster Emperor Star again to see you.”</p>
<p>Shan Qing Luo bit her red lips and clenched her fist tightly, a layer of mist forming across her eyes as she said faintly, “When we last separated, we didn’t even get to say goodbye and it took thirty years for us to reunite. I don’t even know how long we will be apart this time.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai reached out, took her delicate hand, and placed it over his heart as he brought her into his embrace.</p>
<p>Shan Qing Luo looked up and her beautiful eyes blossomed with an amazing brilliance.</p>
<p>Blushing, she held Yang Kai’s hand and also placed it over her heart.</p>
<p>‘You are in my heart, and I am in yours’, such words were left unspoken because there was no need to say them out loud…</p>
<p>Standing up on her tiptoes, Shan Qing Luo closed her eyes tightly as her long eyelashes quivered and she pressed her red lips towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Ah youth…” Not far away, Ba He waxed nostalgically as he crossed his arms and turned his eyes towards the sky.</p>
<p>“Seems my future brother-in-law has been decided,” Yu Xiong grinned as he winked towards Xue Sun.</p>
<p>Xue Sun’s face and neck blushed red as she quickly lowered her gaze and stared at the ground as if trying to find an ant.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s blood began to boil and his breathing became rapid as he tasted the sweetness and beauty of Shan Qing Luo. Although the Beguiling Demon Queen had charms which could enchant any living creature, this was actually her first time engaging in such an act. So, naturally, she was not Yang Kai’s opponent.</p>
<p>Soon, Shan Qing Luo felt embarrassed with her defeat. Her whole being felt like she was floating on the clouds while her body seemed to no longer belong to herself.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Yang Kai let out a yelp and pulled his mouth back.</p>
<p>Shan Qing Luo took this opportunity to escape from his wicked clutches and withdrew a few steps back, a half-full expression remaining on her face as she clenched her teeth and stared towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Why did you bite me?” Yang Kai asked, aggrieved.</p>
<p>“To commemorate the occasion, and to make sure you don’t forget about me even when we’re apart!” Shan Qing Luo giggled and smiled as tears fell from her eyes and she whispered, “Go now, if you don’t… I’m afraid I won’t be able to let you leave.”</p>
<p>She seemed to have made an extremely difficult decision, and her tender body was trembling slightly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai licked his lips and nodded, “Take care of yourself!”</p>
<p>Saying so, he took out a Space Ring and handed it to Shan Qing Luo, “Take this as well, but don’t show its content to anyone.”</p>
<p>“What’s inside?” Shan Qing Luo looked at him suspiciously.</p>
<p>“You’ll understand soon enough,” Yang Kai grinned, not making things clear before turning towards where Ba He and the others were waiting and shouting, “You should all depart now, there’s no need to wait for Xue Lian and the rest of them.”</p>
<p>As soon as he left these words, Space Force wrapped Yang Kai and in the blink of an eye, he disappeared.</p>
<p>Shan Qing Luo opened her mouth, but she didn’t say anything in the end.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1613, Poaching</h2>
<p>Ba He and the others stood in place and looked at each other.</p>
<p>Shan Qing Luo seemed to be in a daze as she held the Space Ring in her small hands, feeling Yang Kai’s lingering warmth on it.</p>
<p>Sinking her Divine Sense into it, and after seeing what was in the Space Ring, Shan Qing Luo immediately flashed a shocked expression.</p>
<p>Inside this Space Ring were at least two hundred Domain Stones!</p>
<p>She almost thought that she was seeing things, but after carefully examining these things, Shan Qing Luo confirmed they were really Domain Stones, each one emitting a gentle Domain aura.</p>
<p>[So many!] Shan Qing Luo was astonished, and her tender body couldn’t help shivering slightly.</p>
<p>One had to know that, over the entire time she spent in the Blood Prison, she had only managed to acquire three Domain Stones. She obtained these three after much painstaking effort and thought she had reaped a great harvest.</p>
<p>Yu Xiong only got a single piece while Ba He managed to acquire two.</p>
<p>But Yang Kai had unexpectedly given her two hundred pieces all at once! This number was enough to drive anyone crazy.</p>
<p>But where had he obtained so many Domain Stones?</p>
<p>After recovering from her initial shock, Shan Qing Luo laughed sweetly as she gripped the Space Ring a little tighter.</p>
<p>With so many Domain Stones, she was confident that she could reach the Origin King Realm in a very short time, and that she would not become a burden to Yang Kai in the future.</p>
<p>“Don’t wait for Xue Lian and the others? What does that mean?” Yu Xiong looked confused.</p>
<p>Ba He’s face dimmed as his eyes flashed, clearly understanding what Yang Kai’s last words implied, and simply waved, “Let’s go, there’s no need to wait.”</p>
<p>Xue Sun also flew over and landed beside the still smiling Shan Qing Luo and pulled her towards a well-concealed Void Corridor nearby.</p>
<p>This Void Corridor had existed in this valley since ancient times and led to a place a million kilometres outside Green Mountains Star. The Monster Race cultivator from Monster Emperor Star always left through this Void Corridor after the Blood Prison closed.</p>
<p>With Ba He, Yu Xiong, and the other’s cultivations, after leaving the Void Corridor, they would need to fly through the Starry Sky for three or four months before returning to Monster Emperor Star.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there wasn’t much danger along this road, so they didn’t have anything to worry about on the way.</p>
<p>Two days later, Yang Kai left the Blood Prison and arrived at a vast wilderness.</p>
<p>Sporadic cultivators appeared one after another from inside the Blood Prison, either alone or in groups, but without exception looking both excited and sad.</p>
<p>Excited because they survived the Blood Prison Trial, an achievement that proved they had the qualifications to condense their Shi to the grand accomplishment stage and possibly break through to the Origin King Realm.</p>
<p>Even if they could not break through in the end, they could still become top-level Origin Realm masters after this experience.</p>
<p>They were also sad because many of their companions had died!</p>
<p>Some great forces even had all the cultivators they sent to participate in the Blood Prison Trial annihilated inside, such as Scarlet Wave Star’s Brilliant Flame Sect.</p>
<p>Above the wilderness, countless cultivators were waiting for their fellow Sect companions to emerge, and once they found them, they would smile and greet them enthusiastically with a look of expectation and hope in their eyes.</p>
<p>Naturally, no one came to welcome Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Shan Qing Luo and the others who came with him from Monster Emperor Star had headed back there.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not care about these people’s excitement and instead released his Divine Sense to start looking for Qian Tong and the others.</p>
<p>He came out late so Qian Tong and the others should have come out long ago!</p>
<p>Soon, he noticed a familiar aura and turned to fly off in a certain direction.</p>
<p>Not far from there, a group of people who seemed to have a strong background were surrounding a beautiful young woman, trying their best to win her over. All of their expressions were extremely sincere, and they were constantly sending out attractive offers.</p>
<p>“Madam, if you don’t have a particular destination in mind, why not come to my Blue Radish Sect? With your cultivation and strength, as long as you join, you can immediately become an Outer Sect Elder, have your own Spirit Peak, and be provided with a generous amount of Saint Crystals and pills every month. My Blue Radish Sect has seventy-two main peaks, one of which is empty as we have not found a suitable owner until today.”</p>
<p>“What does the Blue Radish Sect count for? Madam, come to our Heavenly Dream Palace, we have an Origin King Realm Master who commands Heavenly Dream Palace so you will have an opportunity to receive guidance in the mysteries of Domain every three years if you join us. Madam cannot miss this opportunity.”</p>
<p>“If Madam is willing to join my Imperial Spirit Pavilion, this old master can guarantee that you will become an Inner Sect Elder right away. My Imperial Spirit Pavilion will also do its best to help you cultivate so you can make a breakthrough to the Origin King Realm as soon as possible!”</p>
<p>The beautiful young woman turned a deaf ear to the noise around her and simply stood in place with a frown on her brow, seemingly waiting for someone as she would look around from time to time.</p>
<p>After becoming somewhat annoyed with all the noise around her though, she finally shook her head and said, “I apologize to everyone here, but this Mistress already has a Sect and does not plan to leave it, so please don’t waste your time with me.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if you already have a Sect,” The old man from Imperial Spirit Pavilion who had previously invited her to join laughed, “This old master won’t insist you leave your current Sect. Madam can simply join my Imperial Spirit Pavilion as you are now without any trouble.”</p>
<p>In order to win over this beautiful young woman, he didn’t mind offering extremely generous conditions, not even minding her already having a Sect she belonged to.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I have no such intentions,” The young woman still shook her head.</p>
<p>“Elder Lin,” Yang Kai walked over suddenly and called out.</p>
<p>Hearing this call, Lin Yu Rao’s beautiful eyes lit up and she quickly turned her gaze towards him and called out cheerfully, “Sect Master, you finally came out.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded lightly and looked around, “Why are you alone, where are Qian Tong and the others?”</p>
<p>Lin Yu Rao’s expression turned complicated as she whispered, “It’s not convenient to talk here, let’s talk while walking.”</p>
<p>Seeing this kind of look on her face, Yang Kai did not ask any questions and simply nodded, “Alright.”</p>
<p>“Friend, please wait!” Seeing that Yang Kai was about to take Lin Yu Rao away, the people who had been surrounding her suddenly became anxious and hurriedly stood in front of Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Do you have something you need to say?” Yang Kai frowned.</p>
<p>The old man who had been speaking happily just now cupped his fists and asked politely, “Friend, are you the Sect Master of this lady here?”</p>
<p>“Yes, what of it?”</p>
<p>“Nothing much, this old master is Imperial Spirit Pavilion’s Great Elder, and would like to invite this lady on behalf of my Sect to join our pavilion as an Inner Sect Elder!” The old man saw that Yang Kai was just a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator and could not help feeling somewhat contemptuous, otherwise, how could he continue trying to poach Lin Yu Rao right before Yang Kai’s eyes?</p>
<p>After all, this kind of thing was a bit improper…</p>
<p>“Do all of you have such intentions?” Yang Kai looked around at the rest of the crowd.</p>
<p>“Indeed,” Those people nodded, their expressions calm.</p>
<p>“And your opinion?” Yang Kai turned to look at Lin Yu Rao.</p>
<p>“Why would Sect Master ask such a question? This Mistress won’t leave High Heaven Sect,” Lin Yu Rao brushed her hair behind her ear and responded lightly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded, “All of you heard her, yes? Since that is settled, let’s leave.”</p>
<p>Saying so, Yang Kai tried to lead Lin Yu Rao off.</p>
<p>“Madam, are you certain you don’t want to think about this matter more carefully? If you feel that this old master’s offer is not sincere enough, we can still discuss it, everything is open to negotiation,” The old man still chattered and followed Lin Yu Rao.</p>
<p>“Scram!” Yang Kai shouted coldly as he glared at the old man.</p>
<p>These people had greeted him with smiles, so Yang Kai did not want to embarrass them directly and instead asked Lin Yu Rao for her opinion. But after the other party got Lin Yu Rao’s answer, he was still reluctant to give up, which was nothing less than a slap in the face.</p>
<p>Facing such naked contempt, Yang Kai was not about to just sit back in silence.</p>
<p>The old man was stunned for a moment before his face immediately turned gloomy and he snickered, “Brat, this is none of your concern, you’d better close your mouth obediently otherwise…”</p>
<p>“Otherwise what?” Yang Kai looked back at him coldly.</p>
<p>“Otherwise, you’ll regret it. Do not think that because you are a so-called ‘Sect Master’ you can act rampantly. What thing are you? As a Sect Master, how can you have a cultivation level inferior to one of your Elders? What kind of Sect Master are you? In my opinion, this madam serving you is a waste of her talents, talents that would be better put to use in my Imperial Spirit Pavilion where she will certainly have a brighter future.”</p>
<p>As the old man spoke, the other cultivators who wanted to invite Lin Yu Rao began calling out as well, belittling Yang Kai’s cultivation and trying to force him to back down and not ruin Lin Yu Rao’s future.</p>
<p>“What are you quarrelling about?” Yang Kai was annoyed and said coldly, “Elder Lin has already rejected you, yet you are still trying to bother her, are you not putting me in your eyes at all?”</p>
<p>“Does this old master need to put you in his eyes? Nonsense!” The old man said coldly snorted.</p>
<p>Everyone else looked at Yang Kai disdainfully, obviously not paying attention to him.</p>
<p>The conflict here had attracted a lot of attention, but seeing how Yang Kai was just a trivial Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator and that he had provoked so many enemies all at once, many began wearing sympathetic looks, feeling that Yang Kai had eyes but failed to see and would certainly suffer a big loss.</p>
<p>“Old man, if you don’t want to die, I would stop provoking him. Don’t just look at his cultivation, he’s not someone you can handle,” An abrupt voice interrupted, causing the old man and the others around him to frown. Turning around, they saw that the source of this sound was an ordinary-looking young man standing nearby with his arms folded across his chest and a mocking grin on his face.</p>
<p>Being so disdained, the old man was naturally angry and his face sank, but just as he was about to retort, he caught sight of a three-petal flower pattern embroidered on the chest of the young man’s clothes. As if thinking of something, his expression changed slightly and he cupped his fists politely and asked, “May I ask this friend, who is Senior Wu Dao to you?”</p>
<p>The young man said lightly, “My Master!”</p>
<p>Gasps resounded all around as everyone present stared at this young man in shock, disbelief, and deep envy.</p>
<p>“Heavens, this person is actually a disciple of Senior Wu Dao.”</p>
<p>“It was rumoured that Senior Wu Dao accepted a disciple fifty years ago but unfortunately no one knows who it was. It turns out to be him.”</p>
<p>“He actually came to participate in the Blood Prison Trial.”</p>
<p>“What did he mean just now then? Does that Second-Order Origin Returning Realm boy have some kind of incredible background like him?”</p>
<p>After learning that this young man turned out to be Senior Wu Dao’s disciple, everyone looked at him with awe and envy.</p>
<p>The old man of the Imperial Spirit Pavilion did not dare ignore this young man’s warning just now anymore, frowned, and asked, “This friend, a moment ago, what did you…”</p>
<p>The young man still maintained a relaxed look and just shook his head faintly, “You all heard what I said just now, what more do you want to ask? If you want to die, keep trying to provoke him.”</p>
<p>The old man’s face turned pale as he shot a fear-filled glance towards Yang Kai. Now, it was as if he could see some kind of massive shadow behind Yang Kai, one he didn’t dare act presumptuously before anymore.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1614, A Sect Master Lower Than an Elder</h2>
<p>Yang Kai was also confused at the moment as he observed this young man curiously.</p>
<p>From the reactions of everyone around, Yang Kai had already figured out that this young man’s background was not trivial. This so-called Senior Wu Dao was obviously an Origin King Realm master.</p>
<p>If this wasn’t the case, the crowd would not have had such an exaggerated reaction.</p>
<p>However, why was this person trying to help him? Moreover, Yang Kai somehow felt that this young man was a bit familiar, as if he had met him somewhere before.</p>
<p>“Friend, I’ve paid back the favour I owe you from the Blood Prison. From now on, we don’t have any debts between us,” The youth grinned at Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Hearing what he said, Yang Kai suddenly remembered!</p>
<p>He really had met this young man before, he was one of the thirty or so people who had retreated from Domain Stone Mountain at that time! Before leaving, he had faintly nodded to express his gratitude to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>There were too many people at that time who had made such a gesture though, so Yang Kai had not paid it much mind.</p>
<p>It seemed the so called favour was referring to this. Yang Kai finally understood.</p>
<p>The other party was obviously thanking him for his warning at that time, which had turned out to be life saving advice.</p>
<p>[This person is rather interesting.] Yang Kai smiled and politely cupped his fists as he reported his name, “Yang Kai!”</p>
<p>“Xu Bin Bai!” The young man replied.</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently nodded while faintly sensing that this young man wasn’t simple. This had nothing to do with him having an Origin King Realm master behind him, more like he himself was special.</p>
<p>This was purely intuition without any basis at all.</p>
<p>But Yang Kai trusted his instincts!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the two didn’t have any kind of deep friendship or grudge, so Yang Kai didn’t pay him too much mind. Just as he was about to leave with Lin Yu Rao, however, the surrounding World Energy suddenly trembled, as if it was pounded by a giant hammer, sending powerful vibrations out across a vast area and causing everyone’s expressions to change dramatically.</p>
<p>Soon, a mysterious energy emerged from a distant place and pierced everyone’s hearts like a sharp sword.</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned as he turned to look in the direction this force came from.</p>
<p>Xu Bin Bai also showed a look of surprise, but quickly thinking of something, his expression changed sharply.</p>
<p>“Someone is going to try to break through to the Origin King Realm!” Someone suddenly sounded.</p>
<p>These words immediately broke the surrounding silence.</p>
<p>Everyone turned to look at the speaker in unison with amazement.</p>
<p>“Is that true?”</p>
<p>“En, this is definitely a precursor to someone breaking through to the Origin King Realm. This old master had the honour to witness such a breakthrough before, and although that was many years ago, that memory is still fresh in this old master’s mind. This feeling is exactly the same as the one from that year. There is definitely someone who wants to break through to the Origin King Realm!” The person who spoke explained eloquently.</p>
<p>“It must be some master who emerged from the Blood Prison just now. It seems this person had significant gains in the Blood Prison and decided to make a breakthrough as soon as he came out.”</p>
<p>“The Blood Prison is really a good place and this person’s luck is also quite good.”</p>
<p>“Why are we all just standing around here? We need to hurry up and watch the excitement. The breakthrough of an Origin King isn’t something that can be seen casually. I really want to know who it is that had such good luck.”</p>
<p>The breakthrough of a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master was generally carefully prepared for. The Sect they belonged to would support this breakthrough with everything it had, opening its Sect Defending Array while also deploying all its disciples to stand guard and ensure that the one breaking through was not disturbed.</p>
<p>Those who didn’t have a Sect would invite trusted relatives and friends to protect them while they broke through in a hidden or safe location.</p>
<p>Few people failed to make perfect preparations.</p>
<p>Therefore, the breakthrough of an Origin King was extremely difficult to witness.</p>
<p>But right now, there was a master in the middle of nowhere who was about to try to make a breakthrough.</p>
<p>This person had obviously not made full preparations and acted hastily.</p>
<p>This kind of good show was something one could rarely see even once in thousands of years.</p>
<p>How could the countless cultivators outside the Blood Prison miss such a good opportunity? By observing and emulating the breakthrough of an Origin King Realm master, they could gain a great deal of experience as well as perhaps learning something about Domain, benefits that would last them a lifetime.</p>
<p>As such, after understanding the truth of this matter, the cultivators gathered outside the Blood Prison summoned their Star Shuttles one after another and flew off to seek this unknown master.</p>
<p>“Sect Master!” Lin Yu Rao’s pretty face turned pale as her tender body trembled slightly.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai frowned when he realized that she was not looking right.</p>
<p>“If I’m not mistaken, the one trying to break through… should be Qian Tong!” Lin Yu Rao quickly said.</p>
<p>“What?” Yang Kai was shocked, his expression suddenly turning solemn, “Are you certain it’s really Elder Qian?”</p>
<p>“At least eighty percent!” Lin Yu Rao bit her red lip, “The reason Elder Qian didn’t wait for you here was that he felt his Qi swelling up and showing signs of a breakthrough, so he quickly left hoping to find a secluded place to break through, but now… it seems he was too late.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go!” Yang Kai immediately realized the seriousness of the problem. If the person who was breaking through was indeed Qian Tong, then the current situation was far from ideal.</p>
<p>Outside the Blood Prison, there were at least a thousand cultivators with about seventy or eighty percent of them being Origin Realm masters. At this moment, all of these outside cultivators were rushing towards the place where Qian Tong was trying to break through, and if they were to disturb him in some way, it might cause his breakthrough to fail. At best, Qian Tong would suffer serious wounds while at worst, he would die on the spot.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t know what kind of scene would appear during a breakthrough to the Origin King Realm, but inferring from his breakthrough to the Origin Returning Realm, it would definitely not be simple. The World Energy baptism that was surely to come would be a huge test for Qian Tong, one that others could absolutely not be permitted to interfere with.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, it was Qian Tong who crossed this threshold first! Yang Kai felt somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>After all, when he separated from them at Domain Stone Mountain, Qian Tong showed no signs of breaking through. It seemed like Qian Tong had another significant opportunity over the past few days.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s speed was incredible even without using a Star Shuttle. A pair of almost transparent wings appeared behind him and the sound of roaring wind and thunder resounded as he shot forward, overtaking cultivator after cultivator.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Yang Kai sensed something and turned his head to the side.</p>
<p>Not far away, a figure was moving at a pace on par with his own, and noticing Yang Kai’s gaze, this person turned his head and smiled at him.</p>
<p>Xu Bin Bai! This guy really wasn’t simple, not only able to keep up with his speed but doing so in an obviously relaxed manner.</p>
<p>“Brother Yang, your wings are quite impressive,” Xu Bin Bai glanced at the Wind and Thunder Wings behind Yang Kai and a hint of appreciation flashed across his eyes.</p>
<p>Every time these wings flapped, Yang Kai’s body would make a great leap forward, one Xu Bin Bai had to use significant effort to keep up with.</p>
<p>“You as well!” Yang Kai nodded lightly.</p>
<p>“To each their own,” Xu Bin Bai smiled slightly and asked thoughtfully. “Brother Yang, is the reason you’re acting so anxious because the person trying to break through is related to you?”</p>
<p>“En, that person is indeed related to me!” Yang Kai was in no mood to chat so he simply answered directly.</p>
<p>“Oh? Then this Xu will offer his congratulations to Brother Yang. The addition of an Origin King to a Sect is a very big event. If you have use of this Xu in the coming moments, Brother Yang just needs to ask.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes lit up hearing this and quickly cupped his fists, “Then I shall thank Brother Xu in advance.”</p>
<p>The other party being willing to help was naturally a great boon. Even though Yang Kai did not know how strong an Origin King Wu Dao was, it could be seen from everyone’s attitude towards Xu Bin Bai before that even amongst Origin Kings, his Master Wu Dao was extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of such a fierce tiger’s name would make things far more convenient.</p>
<p>By the time their chat ended, they had already arrived at their destination and Yang Kai fell to the ground with a loud crash like a meteor next to a few people.</p>
<p>The next moment, Xu Bin Bai landed lightly nearby.</p>
<p>“Sect Master, you’re here!” Yang Xiu Zhu and Chu Han Yi saw Yang Kai arrive and their expressions brightened as they quickly saluted.</p>
<p>Mo Yu also nodded lightly while Zhao Tian Ze stepped forward to greet Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Looking around and seeing that everyone he knew was safe, Yang Kai let out a sigh of relief before asking in a deep voice, “Is it Elder Qian?”</p>
<p>“En!” Chu Han Yi frowned, “It happened so suddenly that all of us were caught off guard!”</p>
<p>They obviously also understood the seriousness of the problem. Breaking through here was not a good thing and had turned what should be a happy event into a troublesome one.</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze smiled bitterly, “Originally, this old master was going to take Elder Qian to a place five hundred thousand kilometres away. There’s an isolated region there that few travel through and the World Energy is also rich enough, but…”</p>
<p>“It’s not your fault,” Yang Kai frowned, “By the way, City Lord Zhao, what did Elder Qian encounter that allowed him to suddenly achieve a breakthrough?”</p>
<p>“We didn’t encounter anything in particular, it’s just that after separating from you, Elder Qian broke into a few Domain Vortices and seemed to gain a great deal from them,” Zhao Tian Ze replied respectfully.</p>
<p>“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai nodded gently.</p>
<p>Everyone who had come with Yang Kai to Green Mountains Star had been stuck at the peak of the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm for many years and all had the qualifications to attempt to reach the Origin King Realm. All they were lacking was a greater comprehension of Shi and the appropriate opportunity.</p>
<p>As long as they could condense their Shi to the grand accomplishment stage, they could attempt a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Qian Tong clearly met this requirement.</p>
<p>This was his opportunity and fate!</p>
<p>As Yang Kai’s group was talking, more and more cultivators rushed to this place while around Qian Tong, the World Energy became more and more violent. There was also a mysterious power which was permeating throughout the surroundings. At first this power spread out slowly, but in the blink of an eye it had suddenly expanded greatly.</p>
<p>Qian Tong’s Shi!</p>
<p>Within a range of several thousand metres, winds roared and small tornadoes formed one after another, sealing off the region entirely while creating a violent and shocking display.</p>
<p>Qian Tong’s Shi had indeed reached the grand accomplishment stage and he had successfully integrated his own unique power into it.</p>
<p>“Sure enough, there is someone trying to break through to the Origin King Realm!” A cultivator who arrived here shouted as many stared wide-eyes towards this scene, all of them hoping to get closer and see it more clearly.</p>
<p>Some people actually passed by the location where Yang Kai and his group were standing and approached very closely to try to comprehend the many mysteries which were swirling about.</p>
<p>These were Qian Tong’s insights into the mysteries of the Origin King Realm. When he was breaking through, these insights would diffuse outwards without reservation and were extremely attractive to any Origin Returning Realm master.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face sank and he quickly flew up into the air, cupped his fists to those below, and shouted loudly, “Everyone, please don’t get too close so as not to disturb the concentration of this Yang’s Senior!”</p>
<p>The cultivators who had approached closely, however, just snorted disdainfully towards Yang Kai, not caring about him at all.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1614, A Sect Master Lower Than an Elder</h2>
<p>Yang Kai was also confused at the moment as he observed this young man curiously.</p>

<p>“Someone is going to try to break through to the Origin King Realm!” Someone suddenly sounded.</p>
<p>These words immediately broke the surrounding silence.</p>
<p>Everyone turned to look at the speaker in unison with amazement.</p>
<p>“Is that true?”</p>
<p>“En, this is definitely a precursor to someone breaking through to the Origin King Realm. This old master had the honour to witness such a breakthrough before, and although that was many years ago, that memory is still fresh in this old master’s mind. This feeling is exactly the same as the one from that year. There is definitely someone who wants to break through to the Origin King Realm!” The person who spoke explained eloquently.</p>
<p>“It must be some master who emerged from the Blood Prison just now. It seems this person had significant gains in the Blood Prison and decided to make a breakthrough as soon as he came out.”</p>
<p>“The Blood Prison is really a good place and this person’s luck is also quite good.”</p>
<p>“Why are we all just standing around here? We need to hurry up and watch the excitement. The breakthrough of an Origin King isn’t something that can be seen casually. I really want to know who it is that had such good luck.”</p>
<p>The breakthrough of a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master was generally carefully prepared for. The Sect they belonged to would support this breakthrough with everything it had, opening its Sect Defending Array while also deploying all its disciples to stand guard and ensure that the one breaking through was not disturbed.</p>
<p>Those who didn’t have a Sect would invite trusted relatives and friends to protect them while they broke through in a hidden or safe location.</p>
<p>Few people failed to make perfect preparations.</p>
<p>Therefore, the breakthrough of an Origin King was extremely difficult to witness.</p>
<p>But right now, there was a master in the middle of nowhere who was about to try to make a breakthrough.</p>
<p>This person had obviously not made full preparations and acted hastily.</p>
<p>This kind of good show was something one could rarely see even once in thousands of years.</p>
<p>How could the countless cultivators outside the Blood Prison miss such a good opportunity? By observing and emulating the breakthrough of an Origin King Realm master, they could gain a great deal of experience as well as perhaps learning something about Domain, benefits that would last them a lifetime.</p>
<p>As such, after understanding the truth of this matter, the cultivators gathered outside the Blood Prison summoned their Star Shuttles one after another and flew off to seek this unknown master.</p>
<p>“Sect Master!” Lin Yu Rao’s pretty face turned pale as her tender body trembled slightly.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai frowned when he realized that she was not looking right.</p>
<p>“If I’m not mistaken, the one trying to break through… should be Qian Tong!” Lin Yu Rao quickly said.</p>
<p>“What?” Yang Kai was shocked, his expression suddenly turning solemn, “Are you certain it’s really Elder Qian?”</p>
<p>“At least eighty percent!” Lin Yu Rao bit her red lip, “The reason Elder Qian didn’t wait for you here was that he felt his Qi swelling up and showing signs of a breakthrough, so he quickly left hoping to find a secluded place to break through, but now… it seems he was too late.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go!” Yang Kai immediately realized the seriousness of the problem. If the person who was breaking through was indeed Qian Tong, then the current situation was far from ideal.</p>
<p>Outside the Blood Prison, there were at least a thousand cultivators with about seventy or eighty percent of them being Origin Realm masters. At this moment, all of these outside cultivators were rushing towards the place where Qian Tong was trying to break through, and if they were to disturb him in some way, it might cause his breakthrough to fail. At best, Qian Tong would suffer serious wounds while at worst, he would die on the spot.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t know what kind of scene would appear during a breakthrough to the Origin King Realm, but inferring from his breakthrough to the Origin Returning Realm, it would definitely not be simple. The World Energy baptism that was surely to come would be a huge test for Qian Tong, one that others could absolutely not be permitted to interfere with.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, it was Qian Tong who crossed this threshold first! Yang Kai felt somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>After all, when he separated from them at Domain Stone Mountain, Qian Tong showed no signs of breaking through. It seemed like Qian Tong had another significant opportunity over the past few days.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s speed was incredible even without using a Star Shuttle. A pair of almost transparent wings appeared behind him and the sound of roaring wind and thunder resounded as he shot forward, overtaking cultivator after cultivator.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Yang Kai sensed something and turned his head to the side.</p>
<p>Not far away, a figure was moving at a pace on par with his own, and noticing Yang Kai’s gaze, this person turned his head and smiled at him.</p>
<p>Xu Bin Bai! This guy really wasn’t simple, not only able to keep up with his speed but doing so in an obviously relaxed manner.</p>
<p>“Brother Yang, your wings are quite impressive,” Xu Bin Bai glanced at the Wind and Thunder Wings behind Yang Kai and a hint of appreciation flashed across his eyes.</p>
<p>Every time these wings flapped, Yang Kai’s body would make a great leap forward, one Xu Bin Bai had to use significant effort to keep up with.</p>
<p>“You as well!” Yang Kai nodded lightly.</p>
<p>“To each their own,” Xu Bin Bai smiled slightly and asked thoughtfully. “Brother Yang, is the reason you’re acting so anxious because the person trying to break through is related to you?”</p>
<p>“En, that person is indeed related to me!” Yang Kai was in no mood to chat so he simply answered directly.</p>
<p>“Oh? Then this Xu will offer his congratulations to Brother Yang. The addition of an Origin King to a Sect is a very big event. If you have use of this Xu in the coming moments, Brother Yang just needs to ask.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes lit up hearing this and quickly cupped his fists, “Then I shall thank Brother Xu in advance.”</p>
<p>The other party being willing to help was naturally a great boon. Even though Yang Kai did not know how strong an Origin King Wu Dao was, it could be seen from everyone’s attitude towards Xu Bin Bai before that even amongst Origin Kings, his Master Wu Dao was extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of such a fierce tiger’s name would make things far more convenient.</p>
<p>By the time their chat ended, they had already arrived at their destination and Yang Kai fell to the ground with a loud crash like a meteor next to a few people.</p>
<p>The next moment, Xu Bin Bai landed lightly nearby.</p>
<p>“Sect Master, you’re here!” Yang Xiu Zhu and Chu Han Yi saw Yang Kai arrive and their expressions brightened as they quickly saluted.</p>
<p>Mo Yu also nodded lightly while Zhao Tian Ze stepped forward to greet Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Looking around and seeing that everyone he knew was safe, Yang Kai let out a sigh of relief before asking in a deep voice, “Is it Elder Qian?”</p>
<p>“En!” Chu Han Yi frowned, “It happened so suddenly that all of us were caught off guard!”</p>
<p>They obviously also understood the seriousness of the problem. Breaking through here was not a good thing and had turned what should be a happy event into a troublesome one.</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze smiled bitterly, “Originally, this old master was going to take Elder Qian to a place five hundred thousand kilometres away. There’s an isolated region there that few travel through and the World Energy is also rich enough, but…”</p>
<p>“It’s not your fault,” Yang Kai frowned, “By the way, City Lord Zhao, what did Elder Qian encounter that allowed him to suddenly achieve a breakthrough?”</p>
<p>“We didn’t encounter anything in particular, it’s just that after separating from you, Elder Qian broke into a few Domain Vortices and seemed to gain a great deal from them,” Zhao Tian Ze replied respectfully.</p>
<p>“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai nodded gently.</p>
<p>Everyone who had come with Yang Kai to Green Mountains Star had been stuck at the peak of the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm for many years and all had the qualifications to attempt to reach the Origin King Realm. All they were lacking was a greater comprehension of Shi and the appropriate opportunity.</p>
<p>As long as they could condense their Shi to the grand accomplishment stage, they could attempt a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Qian Tong clearly met this requirement.</p>
<p>This was his opportunity and fate!</p>
<p>As Yang Kai’s group was talking, more and more cultivators rushed to this place while around Qian Tong, the World Energy became more and more violent. There was also a mysterious power which was permeating throughout the surroundings. At first this power spread out slowly, but in the blink of an eye it had suddenly expanded greatly.</p>
<p>Qian Tong’s Shi!</p>
<p>Within a range of several thousand metres, winds roared and small tornadoes formed one after another, sealing off the region entirely while creating a violent and shocking display.</p>
<p>Qian Tong’s Shi had indeed reached the grand accomplishment stage and he had successfully integrated his own unique power into it.</p>
<p>“Sure enough, there is someone trying to break through to the Origin King Realm!” A cultivator who arrived here shouted as many stared wide-eyes towards this scene, all of them hoping to get closer and see it more clearly.</p>
<p>Some people actually passed by the location where Yang Kai and his group were standing and approached very closely to try to comprehend the many mysteries which were swirling about.</p>
<p>These were Qian Tong’s insights into the mysteries of the Origin King Realm. When he was breaking through, these insights would diffuse outwards without reservation and were extremely attractive to any Origin Returning Realm master.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face sank and he quickly flew up into the air, cupped his fists to those below, and shouted loudly, “Everyone, please don’t get too close so as not to disturb the concentration of this Yang’s Senior!”</p>
<p>The cultivators who had approached closely, however, just snorted disdainfully towards Yang Kai, not caring about him at all.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1616, Winning Over</h2>
<p>As a Star Master, it was only natural to be able to sense what happens on the Cultivation Star of which one refined the Star Source.</p>
<p>However, this would also consume a great deal of power, and no Star Master was idle enough to simply be spying on others at will. If there was enough time for that, they might as well just cultivate instead.</p>
<p>Yang Kai naturally understood this as Xia Ning Chang was also a Star Master, although her situation was a bit special. With her ability, she was still able to perceive the situation everywhere in Tong Xuan Realm.</p>
<p>As a Second-Order Origin King, Luo Hai was several times stronger than Xia Ning Chang and probably had no difficulties perceiving the situation inside the Blood Prison.</p>
<p>Seeing the dark look on Yang Kai’s face, Xu Bin Bai immediately understood what he was worried about and chuckled, “Brother Yang doesn’t need to be too nervous. The chaotic power of Domain which floods the Blood Prison is so powerful that even Senior Luo Hai shouldn’t be able to perceive what happens inside too clearly.”</p>
<p>“Not too clearly?” Yang Ka’s brow rose.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is said that there is a barrier which was erected by the previous Star Master of Green Mountains Star using the power of its Star Source around the Blood Prison. The previous generation Star Master had a Third-Order Origin King cultivation, which is higher than the current Senior Luo Hai, so until Senior Luo Hai reaches a similar height, it should be difficult for him to overcome this barrier entirely,” Xu Bin Bai explained.</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded slightly, his nervous expression relaxing somewhat.</p>
<p>However, even if what Xu Bin Bai said was true, Yang Kai remained a little uneasy.</p>
<p>The movement at Domain Stone Mountain wasn’t of concern as it was the Stone Puppet who was secretly acting at the time. As such, Yang Kai was confident that even if Luo Hai was paying attention, he would never have noticed what really happened.</p>
<p>However, the events on Monster Mountain were a different story.</p>
<p>Chi Yue and the other Tribal Lords knew about the existence of the Origin Essence Crystal there, so how could Luo Hai, as Green Mountains Star’s Star Master, not know?</p>
<p>Yang Kai had fought a great battle with Mad Crocodile Monster King on Monster Mountain after which he had taken the Origin Essence Crystal away with him…</p>
<p>[Does Luo Hai know about this?] Yang Kai didn’t dare to make arbitrary judgments, but the Origin Essence Crystal was a treasure that Chi Yue coveted greatly.</p>
<p>Chi Yue had the same cultivation as Luo Hai, so what she wanted, he must want as well!</p>
<p>Many thoughts flashed across Yang Kai’s mind before he took a deep breath and restored his calm while shooting a glance towards the golden-crown-wearing Luo Hai.</p>
<p>The other party was also paying attention to him, and when their four eyes suddenly met, Yang Kai clearly saw Luo Hai’s eyes flash.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s heart sank!</p>
<p>“Oh… Young Man, what’s the relationship between you and Senior Wu Dao?” The beautiful woman who had walked over to Yang Kai first and was about to ask him about himself suddenly noticed Xu Bin Bai standing beside Yang Kai as well as the three-petal flower pattern on his chest and asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“He is my Master!” Xu Bin Bai replied, neither humbly nor arrogantly.</p>
<p>“Senior Wu Dao is your master?” Li Wan Ning couldn’t help covering her mouth as a look of shock filled her face.</p>
<p>“What, this little guy is Senior Wu Dao’s disciple?” The other Origin Kings who were following behind also exclaimed, as if they had found something extraordinary, all of them turning to look at Xu Bin Bai with interest.</p>
<p>Even Luo Hai, who was the strongest amongst this group and who also possessed the highest status, showed a trace of shock. Obviously, he had not expected that someone with such immense background would participate in this Blood Prison Trial.</p>
<p>“Xu Bin Bai greets several Seniors!” Although Xu Bin Bai was a disciple of Wu Dao, he was still a Junior, so he didn’t dare act aloof when facing so many Origin Kings and politely offered his greetings.</p>
<p>“En, Little Brother need not act so polite.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, there are no outsiders here so there’s no need for such formality. This Zhou was fortunate enough to meet Senior Wu Dao five hundred years ago and suddenly became enlightened thanks to Senior’s advice. Only then was I able to break through to the Origin King Realm. Strictly speaking, Senior Wu Dao is this Zhou’s half-master, so you and I are fellow apprentice brothers.” The burly looking man wore a kind smile as he spoke to Xu Bin Bai. Even as an Origin King, he obviously didn’t care about his identity at all and highly praised Wu Dao.</p>
<p>“Senior Zhou must be joking; this Junior does not have the skill or ability to dare call Senior Zhou a brother!” Xu Bin Bai smiled lightly and said humbly.</p>
<p>“Hahaha. Senior Wu Dao seems to have found a promising successor. Little Boy, work hard so as not to lose face for Senior Wu Dao.”</p>
<p>“Junior will take Senior’s teachings to heart!” Xu Bin Bai replied.</p>
<p>“En, when you see Senior Wu Dao again, please extend him this Luo’s greetings,” Luo Hai exhorted him kindly.</p>
<p>“Junior will certainly deliver Senior Luo’s sentiments!” Xu Bin Bai nodded, “Master once said that if nothing unexpected happens, the next master to break through to the Third-Order Origin King will be Senior Luo Hai.”</p>
<p>When the various Origin Kings heard this, all of them turned a look of admiration towards Luo Hai, obviously treating such an evaluation from Wu Dao as extremely high praise.</p>
<p>“Really?” Luo Hai raised his brows, a look of pride appearing on his face as he laughed loudly. “Then this Luo will certainly do his best to live up to Senior Wu Dao’s high expectations!”</p>
<p>“Junior hopes that Senior achieves this accomplishment soon.”</p>
<p>“En, enough gossip though. All of you should do what you came here to do,” Luo Hai smiled and looked at Yang Kai with interest.</p>
<p>“How should we address this little brother?” Li Wan Ning was the first to ask, smiling at Yang Kai as a light floral fragrance wafted from her figure.</p>
<p>The others also stared at him with inquisitive eyes.</p>
<p>“Yang Kai!”</p>
<p>“Yang Kai?” Everyone heard this name and frowned, looking around at each other as they shook their heads slowly, indicating they had never heard this name before.</p>
<p>Generally, the rising stars in the Origin Returning Realm would have some fame associated with their names, but this was the first time they had heard of Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Why does this old master feel like he’s heard someone mention your name before?” Only Old Jiu showed a thoughtful expression.</p>
<p>“Senior is…”</p>
<p>“This is Old Jiu of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce!” The beautiful woman took the initiative to introduce Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce?” Yang Kai’s brow twitched, “Senior may have heard my name from Xue Yue.”</p>
<p>Old Jiu’s eyes lit up and he nodded and said, “That’s right, I heard about you from the Third Young Master. This old master remembers the last Third Young Master came back from the Emperor Garden he mentioned you several times. Is Little Brother familiar with Third Young Master?”</p>
<p>“En,” Yang Kai braced himself and nodded.</p>
<p>Rather than familiar, that woman Xue Yue couldn’t wait to cut him up into tiny little pieces…</p>
<p>“This is really fate!” Old Jiu was overjoyed, “It is no small matter for the Third Young Master to never forget a person. Little Brother, if you are willing to join my Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, you can definitely become one of my Chamber of Commerce’s future high-level figures with your aptitude. You should understand just how influential my Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce is in the Star Field, right?”</p>
<p>“Hey Old Jiu, this Mistress came here first, didn’t she? Isn’t it a bit unfair for you to suddenly cut in line?” Li Wan Ning saw Old Jiu speaking so straightly that she suddenly felt a little unhappy.</p>
<p>“How can this kind of thing be decided by a first-come-first-served attitude? Clearly, the one who strikes first has the advantage!” Old Jiu laughed loudly while he continued trying to win over Yang Kai, “Little Brother, Xue Yue Third Young Master rarely cares about any young talents, and this old master also knows a little bit about your strength and aptitude, so if you join my Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, this old master can take responsibility to offer you this…”</p>
<p>Old Jiu began listing a set of attractive conditions that caused all the nearby cultivators who were listening to gasp and stare at Yang Kai with envy and jealousy, wishing they could rush up and recommend themselves while begging Old Jiu to let them join Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>“Don’t listen to him, what’s so good about Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce?” Li Wan Ning sneered and immediately set her beautiful eyes upon Yang Kai while elegantly saying, “Little brother, as long as you promise to join my Purple Star, I can offer you the same conditions as Old Jiu as well as find you an Origin King Realm master to personally guide your cultivation. Of course, if you would like, this Queen can also personally guide you. What do you say?”</p>
<p>“Don’t go making exaggerated claims without having anything to back your words up with, you two,” The old woman surnamed Lei couldn’t help butting in, tapping her cane on the ground as she turned to Yang Kai and said. “Little brother, you should join my Sword Union instead. En, our Sword Union always welcomes young fresh blood. As long as you agree to join now, this token is yours!”</p>
<p>Saying so, the old woman surnamed Lei suddenly summoned a black token into her hand.</p>
<p>The token was made from neither metal nor jade and had a sword-shaped emblem on it while pulsing with a faint but sharp aura.</p>
<p>“A Sword Union Elder Token!” A rather knowledgeable person called out as he gazed at this token blazingly.</p>
<p>“Impossible, how could it be a Sword Union Elder Token? Can a Second-Order Origin Realm cultivator even become a Sword Union Elder?”</p>
<p>“Senior Lei is truly bold. There should only be ten Great Elders in the entire Sword Union, each one a top-rank character.”</p>
<p>“Tsk tsk, with this Elder Token, one can mobilize a large part of the human and financial resources of Sword Union. With it, there would be no need to worry about one’s cultivation in the future.”</p>
<p>“What is so special about this little brat? Why are so many masters trying to win him over?”</p>
<p>Amongst the onlookers, various reactions like admiration, jealousy, and confusion abounded.</p>
<p>No one understood why these Origin Kings were ignoring all the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators around them and doing their best to invite a mere Second-Order Origin Returning Realm boy to join their forces instead.</p>
<p>All of them weren’t any worse than him, right? Many felt indignant and began having competitive thoughts.</p>
<p>With the Star Field’s three super forces all having set out their offers, the other Origin Kings were unwilling to fall behind and instantly began trying to woo Yang Kai one by one, each of them expressing an extremely sincere attitude.</p>
<p>There was only one lone Origin King Realm old man who remained indifferent, as his intentions here were simply to purchase Domain Stones.</p>
<p>“Several Seniors’ intentions, Junior understands well,” Yang Kai waited for them to finish before nodding sincerely.</p>
<p>He never expected that he would receive so much attention just after stepping out of the Blood Prison. These Origin King Realm masters were all trying to win him over with unusual zeal!</p>
<p>Each of them had a friendly attitude and a very sincere look on their face.</p>
<p>However, the more enthusiastic they acted, the more disturbed Yang Kai’s heart became!</p>
<p>These masters inviting him so vigorously must be because they knew about his performance inside the Blood Prison, otherwise, how could they act like this?</p>
<p>And the reason why they could understand this was all because of Luo Hai!</p>
<p>[This place is not suitable to stay for long!] Yang Kai secretly made up his mind to immediately leave Green Mountains Star after Qian Tong finished his breakthrough successfully.</p>
<p>“Since you understand, what is your decision?” Li Wan Ning asked nervously.</p>
<p>From Luo Hai, they deeply understood how excellent Yang Kai was. Throughout the ages, many Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators had entered the Blood Prison, but the number who had come out unscathed was one, Yang Kai being the very first.</p>
<p>This alone was enough for them to want to win the other over, not to mention that they were able to tell that Yang Kai had some incredible ability, with their vision.</p>
<p>He was definitely a genius among geniuses, and no one wanted to miss out on a chance to recruit him.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1617, Insufficient World Energy</h2>
<p>Above the wilderness, eight Origin Kings looked towards Yang Kai, waiting for his reply.</p>
<p>Over a thousand other cultivators had their eyes focused on Yang Kai as well, and for a moment, Qian Tong’s breakthrough to the Origin King Realm faded into the background.</p>
<p>Xu Bin Bai stood to the side and smiled, seemingly not surprised at all. To him, it was only natural that Yang Kai had attracted the attention of so many people.</p>
<p>“Several Seniors’ intentions, Junior understands very well,” Yang Kai nodded faintly, “But please forgive this Junior for speaking presumptuously. This Junior is flattered and thankful, but I am afraid this Junior is not fated to receive several Seniors’ blessings.”</p>
<p>“Uh…” Old Jiu was stunned, obviously not having anticipated Yang Kai would refuse so many sincere invitations from all of the Origin Kings who were trying to win him over.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you don’t want to take some more to consider this matter?” Li Wan Ning was also quite surprised. All of these Origin Kings had been certain that Yang Kai would not refuse such an invitation and would accept at least one of them.</p>
<p>However, he actually rejected all of them, a truly surprising turn of events.</p>
<p>The cultivators who were watching also flew into an uproar!</p>
<p>“Is this boy an idiot? So many great opportunities were laid out in front of his eyes, yet he plans to actually refuse all of them?”</p>
<p>“There’s definitely something wrong with this brat’s head. Why are all of us even here? Isn’t it to seek opportunities and resources? Now that all these benefits were offered to him, doesn’t he want any of them? Why didn’t I receive this kind of Heaven sent opportunity? The injustice of it all!”</p>
<p>“Senior Jiu, I am willing to join the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, please take me with you.”</p>
<p>“Senior Lei, I have long admired Sword Union, please be sure to accept me.”</p>
<p>“Senior Li…”</p>
<p>The scene descended into chaos as the invitations of all eight Origin King Realm masters were rejected by Yang Kai. The Origin Kings also felt slightly uncomfortable having been rejected like this, and when they saw others yelling towards them suddenly, their expressions sank, and they released some of their strength.</p>
<p>No one present could withstand the anger of an Origin King and realizing that these masters weren’t in a good mood, the clatter abruptly stopped, with no one daring to act presumptuous again.</p>
<p>“Little brother, are you certain?” Li Wan Ning looked at Yang Kai in disbelief. She really did not understand why Yang Kai was so indifferent. The conditions she offered weren’t bad and could even be said to be extremely generous. Moreover, she had even offered to personally guide him in his cultivation.</p>
<p>The personal guidance of an Origin King Realm master was something that all Origin Returning Realm cultivators dreamed of.</p>
<p>Was he not tempted at all?</p>
<p>“That’s right, please think twice about this,” Old Jiu looked at Yang Kai unwillingly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai, however, just slowly shook his head, smiled, and said, “Junior really must decline several Seniors good intentions. Junior simply has no plans to join any great force currently.”</p>
<p>Hearing him say this, everyone showed a look of regret; after all, they had just missed out on such a good seedling and only the Heavens knew when they would run into another in the future.</p>
<p>“Alright, Alright. Since this little brother doesn’t want to join any of you, there’s no need to force the issue. Besides, aren’t there still many good candidates here?” Luo Hai smiled gently.</p>
<p>“En, a forcefully picked melon is not sweet, this old master won’t insist any further. However, little brother, if you ever feel like joining my Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce someday, just go to Water Moon Star to find this old master. The doors of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce will always be open to you and the conditions this old master offered will remain unchanged,” Old Jiu nodded lightly to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“The same goes for my Sword Union,” The old woman surnamed Lei immediately said.</p>
<p>The other Origin Kings expressed similar opinions, saying that if Yang Kai wanted to join them in the future, he could come look for them directly whenever he wanted.</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>The Origin Kings gathered around Yang Kai then scattered and began to look for other outstanding candidates to recruit.</p>
<p>They had come to Green Mountains Star this time first to lead some of their own great force’s disciples to participate in the Blood Prison Trial, and second to recruit new talents after the trial ended.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s performance had simply been too blinding, so he had become their first goal. Now that Yang Kai had refused their offers though, they naturally set their sights on other candidates.</p>
<p>In an instant, many people gathered around the Origin King Realm masters, all of them volunteering to join their forces.</p>
<p>Luo Hai didn’t move though.</p>
<p>Yang Kai turned to him, thought about it for a moment, then cupped his fists politely, “Many thanks Senior for your assistance, this Junior will keep this favour in mind.”</p>
<p>Luo Hai glanced at him and smiled lightly, “You’re welcome, this King is Green Mountains Star’s Star Master, so this is only what this King should do. En, looking at your face, it seems you have some concerns bothering you right now. Could the one breaking through to the Origin King right now be your friend?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not try to deny this, as in front of such a master denial served no purpose, simply nodding and saying, “Yes, he is one of my elders.”</p>
<p>“No wonder you aren’t interested in the offers of others, it turns out one of your Elders is going to break through to the Origin King Realm!” Luo Hai seemed to understand something and chuckled, “This King is also a little curious, where are you from? How come each of you seems to be so outstanding?”</p>
<p>While speaking, he glanced around at Yang Xiu Zhu, Chu Han Yi and Lin Yu Rao who had all been standing beside Yang Kai. With Luo Hai’s eyesight, he was naturally able to see that each of these three had cultivated to the very peak of the Origin Returning Realm, which meant they only needed to achieve a slightly deeper comprehension of Shi in order to break through to the Origin King Realm.</p>
<p>In other words, these three were pinnacle masters in the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm.</p>
<p>Yang Kai knit his brow, and although feeling somewhat reluctant in his heart, he still replied, “We are from Shadowed Star.”</p>
<p>“Shadowed Star…” Luo Hai frowned, because despite being quite knowledgeable, he had never heard of Shadowed Star before. Glancing over at Yang Kai for a moment, however, he wore a meaningful smile and said, “It must be a good place!”</p>
<p>He clearly thought Yang Kai had casually fabricated the name of a Cultivation Star to fool him.</p>
<p>Luo Hai did not have any intention to pursue this issue though, as he fell silent and turned to stare outwards indifferently, as if he had sunk into contemplation.</p>
<p>Yang Kai also raised his eyes and focused his attention on Qian Tong’s location.</p>
<p>Over there, Qian Tong’s Shi had now spread out to a radius of a few thousand metres, and the swirling winds inside this range were becoming more and more violent. Small vortices combined to form bigger ones, while bigger ones split apart into several smaller ones in a constant dynamic situation.</p>
<p>The earth within this radius now appeared like it had been haphazardly plowed by an iron hoe, with criss-crossing ravines and ditches dug out in random directions.</p>
<p>What’s more, an astonishing and terrifying amount of World Energy had gathered high up into the sky, gradually forming a thick black cloud that blotted out the sun.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was both shocked and moved.</p>
<p>He noticed just how immense the World Energy hidden inside these dark clouds were and it was enough to frighten even him.</p>
<p>This was also not the end as the surrounding World Energy was still continuing to gather together.</p>
<p>As time passed by, the noisy scene gradually calmed, and the Origin Kings who had been recruiting talents gradually returned. Each of them had apparently gained a lot, but those they had gathered were offered vastly different treatment than what was offered to Yang Kai previously.</p>
<p>Not only did these newly recruited talents have to accept some difficult tests, even if they were to pass these tests and became eligible to join the great forces these Origin Kings represented, they could not enjoy the rich treatment Yang Kai would have.</p>
<p>No one dared to complain though.</p>
<p>Bargaining with an Origin King Realm master was no different than courting death!</p>
<p>All eyes were now staring towards Qian Tong’s location while the several Origin Kings who had once again gathered began whispering amongst themselves.</p>
<p>Soon, these Origin Kings seemed to obtain some information from Luo Hai and all of them turned to look at Yang Kai in astonishment and asked, “Little brother, is the person who is breaking through your Elder?”</p>
<p>“En.” Yang Kai nodded.</p>
<p>“Is his temperament the same as yours?” Old Jiu quipped.</p>
<p>They felt somewhat regretful being unable to win over Yang Kai, but there was another person more worthy of them trying to win over here, Qian Tong!</p>
<p>In the end, Yang Kai was just a good seedling with excellent aptitude, but his future was still uncertain.</p>
<p>The Star Field was vast and had so many geniuses living in it, but most of these geniuses would fall before they truly reached the peak of the Martial Dao. On the other hand, there were some who plodded along slowly but who would eventually have the last laugh as they simply managed to survive to reach a height where others had no choice but to look up to them.</p>
<p>Among the many Origin Kings present, not all of them had started out as top-level geniuses, but they were all now amongst the most powerful cultivators in the Star Field.</p>
<p>In short, Qian Tong and Yang Kai’s worth was vastly different at this moment; after all, once Qian Tong broke through successfully, he would be a genuine Origin King Realm!</p>
<p>There were not many Origin Kings in each great force, so even adding one more would greatly increase their overall strength.</p>
<p>It was obvious these Origin Kings would put in their best effort to win over Qian Tong!</p>
<p>Of course, this was all based on the premise that Qian Tong was able to break through successfully.</p>
<p>“Do several Seniors want to try winning him over?” Yang Kai quickly understood.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Old Jiu nodded.</p>
<p>“If that is the case, several Seniors might as well speak with him when the time comes, if he wishes to join any of you then this Junior will naturally not have any opinion.”</p>
<p>“Why you…” Old Jiu smiled helplessly.</p>
<p>With this matter temporarily settled, everyone fell silent and focused all their attention on Qian Tong’s approaching breakthrough.</p>
<p>At a certain moment, Yang Kai frowned suddenly and turned his eyes towards the thick black clouds high up in the sky, faintly feeling something was wrong.</p>
<p>He didn’t know why, but though this dark cloud had been growing continuously, and had drawn in all the World Energy within a ten thousand kilometre radius, it still hadn’t initiated Qian Tong’s baptism.</p>
<p>Breaking through to a new Great Realm would inevitably be accompanied by a World Energy baptism, after which a cultivator’s cultivation would truly rise.</p>
<p>However, the baptism still refused to begin, leaving only an extremely tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>“Brother Yang, the concentration of World Energy here is insufficient!” Xu Bin Bai suddenly moved to Yang Kai’s side and whispered.</p>
<p>“Is that a problem?” Yang Kai showed a look of surprise.</p>
<p>“En. Because I am at the peak of the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, I can break through to the Origin King Realm at any time, but before attempting to do so, my Master had warned me that the most important thing to prepare is a place with sufficient World Energy!” Xu Bin Bai explained.</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned.</p>
<p>Although the World Energy of Green Mountains Star was indeed quite good, there were naturally some places which were superior to others. The World Energy density in this vast wilderness was not very high and was obviously insufficient to meet the requirements of Qian Tong’s breakthrough.</p>
<p>“Is there a solution?” Yang Kai asked hurriedly.</p>
<p>“Of course, there is,” Before Xu Bin Bai could answer, Old Jiu suddenly laughed and interjected, “If there is not enough World Energy, one simply needs to supplement it. Saint Crystals are the best choice in this kind of situation. Little brother, if you wish to borrow some Saint Crystals from this old master, this old master will naturally oblige. Although this old master does not have much on him, he certainly has enough Saint Crystals to solve this little issue.”</p>
<h2>Chapter 1618, Dire Situation</h2>
<p>Old Jiu was obviously trying to show good will, taking the initiative to offer to loan Yang Kai some Saint Crystals. If Yang Kai accepted his favour, he would have a significant bargaining chip in hand; after all, eating from another man’s table and not reciprocating was simply bad manners.</p>
<p>“This Queen also has many Saint Crystals here,” Li Wan Ning pursed her lips and smiled.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s mouth twitched as he directly ignored them. Naturally, he understood what these people were up to.</p>
<p>At this time, if he really borrowed Saint Crystals from them, the favour would be quite heavy as this was related to Qian Tong successfully breaking through to the Origin King Realm.</p>
<p>“How many Saint Crystals do you have?” Yang Kai turned to look at Yang Xiu Zhu and the others.</p>
<p>Yang Xiu Zhu and the others exchanged a quick glance before taking out all their Saint Crystals and giving them to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“That’s all?” Yang Kai did a rough count with his Divine Sense and frowned.</p>
<p>The number of Saint Crystals they had collectively was only about five million.</p>
<p>Such few Saint Crystals weren’t small, more than enough to satisfy each of their individual cultivation needs. Moreover, when they left Shadowed Star, Yang Kai had basically been responsible for bringing along Saint Crystals.</p>
<p>However, those Saint Crystals were already used up on Tong Xuan Realm when Little Senior Sister was refining the Star Source.</p>
<p>As such, Yang Kai did not have many Saint Crystals on hand!</p>
<p>He could not help feeling a little troubled and quickly began rummaging through his Space Ring.</p>
<p>From the Space Rings of Mi Tian, ​​Xue Lian, Lie Feng and a few others, Yang Kai was able to gather a few more Saint Crystals, but only about five million more!</p>
<p>All of these cultivators had come here to participate in the Blood Prison Trial, so how could they have brought a large number of Saint Crystals with them?</p>
<p>“If you don’t have enough, I can lend you some,” Seeing Yang Kai’s expression, Xu Bin Bai took the initiative to speak.</p>
<p>“How could I ask that of you?” Yang Kai sighed, never having anticipated that one day he would be worried about having enough Saint Crystals. In the past, he had always spent Saint Crystals freely without any cares.</p>
<p>“Why not? It’s just Saint Crystals,” Xu Bin Bai grinned, “But I don’t have much, only about twenty million.”</p>
<p>“That should be enough,” Yang Kai nodded. “Many thanks, Brother Xu.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome. Maybe this Xu will also have a request for Brother Yang one day. When that time comes, please do not refuse,” Xu Bin Bai smiled and handed a Space Ring to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai took it and nodded to him, “This Yang will forever remember Brother Xu’s kindness. If there is ever a day you need this Yang’s assistance, please don’t hesitate to ask.”</p>
<p>“I hope you and I will meet again then,” Xu Bin Bai smiled lightly.</p>
<p>Thirty million was not a huge number of Saint Crystals, but it also wasn’t small.</p>
<p>However, it should be enough for Qian Tong’s breakthrough. The World Energy in this wilderness was only a little thin, not barren.</p>
<p>Seeing Yang Kai prefer to ask Xu Bin Bai to borrow Saint Crystals than them, the many Origin Kings present exchanged a helpless glance.</p>
<p>Yang Kai knew what they were thinking, so they understood his thought process as well.</p>
<p>Not making a big deal of the situation, Old Jiu just kindly reminded, “Boy, if you want to deliver Saint Crystals to your Elder, you should do so quickly. The dangers of breaking through to the Origin King Realm are beyond your imagination, if you remain too long inside, you will likely get caught up in those dangers.”</p>
<p>“Many thanks for Senior’s reminder!” Yang Kai gently nodded, took a deep breath, then flew upwards.</p>
<p>The next moment, Yang Kai’s figure transformed into a streak of light that rushed straight into the chaotic storm.</p>
<p>Everyone was paying attention to his movements with single-minded focus.</p>
<p>Countless big and small tornadoes swept back and forth, but Yang Kai’s figure was able to flicker between them and approach the centre of the disturbance at extremely fast speed.</p>
<p>The Shi permeating from Qian Tong’s body was actually his biggest obstacle.</p>
<p>Shi which was condensed to the grand accomplishment stage was almost on par with Domain, but fortunately, Yang Kai now had plenty of experience breaking into Domain Vortices inside the Blood Prison. This obstacle could not bar his path, and after integrating his own Shi into the surroundings, Yang Kai didn’t encounter much resistance as he moved forward.</p>
<p>This also allowed Yang Kai to not interfere with Qian Tong’s breakthrough.</p>
<p>“This boy has some impressive skill!” Old Jiu’s eyes flashed.</p>
<p>“He managed to integrate his own Shi into another’s so smoothly. It seems his understanding of Shi has far surpassed that of an ordinary Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator!”</p>
<p>“If given enough time, he will definitely break through to the Origin King Realm!”</p>
<p>After less than ten breaths, Yang Kai arrived nearby Qian Tong.</p>
<p>Qian Tong was sitting cross-legged at this moment, but Yang Kai’s arrival had naturally disturbed him, so he opened his eyes. After seeing that it was Yang Kai, however, Qian Tong closed his eyelids again and remained as motionless as a rock.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not dare to delay. Using his Divine Sense, Yang Kai took out all the Saint Crystals he had gathered from his Space Ring and piled them up around Qian Tong.</p>
<p>“Elder Qian, take this, it may be of help to you at the critical moment,” Yang Kai suddenly threw a jade bottle over to Qian Tong.</p>
<p>After finishing all this, Yang Kai rushed back out.</p>
<p>A short time later, Yang Kai returned to his original spot.</p>
<p>As soon as he stood firm, a shocking energy fluctuation suddenly emerged.</p>
<p>A white beam of light shot up into the sky, and along with this beam, the thirty million Saint Crystals Yang Kai had just scattered about and burst into dazzling light. It seemed that the energy inside these Saint Crystals had been drawn out and sucked up into the dark clouds up above.</p>
<p>The dark clouds immediately became thicker and more solid.</p>
<p>A shocking clap of thunder suddenly resounded.</p>
<p><em>Kacha…</em></p>
<p>With a deafening sound, the power of Heaven and Earth fell from above like a great flood dragon and bombarded Qian Tong without warning, pouring into his body in a relentless torrent.</p>
<p>“It has begun!” Luo Hai muttered in a low voice and stared fixedly.</p>
<p>Qian Tong’s breakthrough had finally begun!</p>
<p>A kind of magical aura spread out as soon as the breakthrough began, causing all the cultivators present to involuntarily show a thoughtful expression. Everyone was trying their best to comprehend this mysterious air to benefit from it.</p>
<p>This was the Domain of an Origin King that was breaking through, something that was of great value to the growth of all the Origin Realm cultivators present.</p>
<p>The first wave of World Energy in the baptism caused the entire region to tremble violently, with tremors reaching as far as ten thousand kilometres away. It was a terrifying experience that left all in awe of the power of the world.</p>
<p>Such a display of power left many Origin Realm masters pale.</p>
<p>These masters were imagining themselves in Qian Tong’s place and realizing that for most of them, at their current strength, it would be impossible for them to resist. In all likelihood, a single confrontation would result in them dying!</p>
<p>Was breaking through to the Origin King Realm really this frightening?</p>
<p>Some people felt their confidence suffer a blow while others instead felt inspired as a strong sense of desire filled their eyes.</p>
<p>The Origin Kings present were paying close attention to Qian Tong but were also keeping an eye on the reactions of the surrounding cultivators, identifying which of them were talents that could be cultivated.</p>
<p>The second wave of the baptism pounded down soon after, followed by a third, then a fourth…</p>
<p>Soon, it was as if a torrential downpour was taking place, with not a single break in-between.</p>
<p>Qian Tong’s beast-like roars rang out and it was not difficult for anyone to imagine just how much pressure he was currently facing.</p>
<p>His own Shi was fluctuating wildly as the numerous whirlwinds whipped around him, gradually sublimating, and transforming his Shi in the process.</p>
<p>As time passed slowly, Yang Kai and the others looked on nervously.</p>
<p>From Qian Tong’s roars, Yang Kai could infer some information. The pressure Qian Tong was experiencing seemed to be growing greater and greater, and his aura was simultaneously growing weaker and weaker, his vitality now seeming quite weak.</p>
<p>It was as if he was afloat on a small boat in the middle of a storm, in danger of being swallowed up at any moment.</p>
<p>“The situation isn’t good!” Old Jiu looked worried.</p>
<p>“En, the World Energy baptism that he is bearing seems to be much stronger than the one I experienced,” Li Wan Ning also frowned.</p>
<p>“The stronger the baptism you endure, the higher your achievements will be in the future. Each Origin King experiences a different intensity of baptism when they attempt to break through. If one survives, their horizons expand greatly, but if they fail, even their soul will be extinguished,” Luo Hai sighed softly, “From ancient times to present, how many geniuses have fallen on this threshold? Breakthroughs for the Martial Dao’s first few Great Realms aren’t too troublesome, but after the Saint King Realm, no Great Realm can be crossed casually, each one is a struggle against death!”</p>
<p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Each person present was a seasoned expert, so how could they not understand such simple truths?</p>
<p>Luo Hai was right. When a Saint King broke through to the Origin Returning Realm, they would have to face a life or death challenge, and failure would have only one result, death!</p>
<p>There was no other possibility!</p>
<p>Once the power of Heaven and Earth gathered, either one was reborn under its baptism, or they died trying.</p>
<p>Old Jiu glanced over at Yang Kai, pondered for a moment, then spoke, “Boy, you’d best be mentally prepared, the current situation is not optimistic.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai simply turned his head and glanced at him before chuckling, “Elder Qian will succeed.”</p>
<p>Old Jiu simply shook his head, “Sometimes will is not enough to overcome reality. This old master also hopes that this person can succeed, but…”</p>
<p>He did not continue, apparently feeling Qian Tong’s prospects weren’t optimistic.</p>
<p>Yang Xiu Zhu and the others also became nervous.</p>
<p>Five of them had followed Yang Kai to leave Shadowed Star and come to Green Mountains Star. It was mere coincidence that their arrival here coincided with the once-in-a-thousand-year opening of the Blood Prison Trial and Qian Tong’s opportunities had clearly been the best, bringing him to the point where he was finally qualified to touch the threshold of the Origin King Realm. None of them wanted to see him fail at this last moment.</p>
<p>If he succeeded, Qian Tong would become the first Origin King born on Shadowed Star in over ten thousand years.</p>
<p>Although he would be breaking through on a different Cultivation Star, it would be enough to allow Yang Xiu Zhu and the others to see hope for the future.</p>
<p>The power of heaven and earth continued to fall, bombarding Qian Tong constantly while his roars grew increasingly weaker. Soon, Qian Tong’s vitality was akin to candlelight caught in a storm, teetering on the brink of being snuffed out…</p>
<p>“Ha, it looks like he will fall short,” The old woman surnamed Lei shook her head suddenly, a trace of regret appearing on her face.</p>
<p>“En, it’s a pity after reaching such a point,” Old Jiu nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Under their perception, Qian Tong’s vitality had already dimmed to the point where there was no hope of him surviving.</p>
<p>If nothing changed, this person would undoubtedly die!</p>
<h2>Chapter 1619, Unexpected Outcome</h2>
<p>A breakthrough to the Origin King Realm was not only dependent on strength, sometimes luck was the deciding factor.</p>
<p>Qian Tong’s luck obviously was not good.</p>
<p>Although his strength surpassed the average for Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators by a large margin, and he had significant gains inside the Blood Prison, the World Energy baptism he encountered while breaking through was incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>He had been able to endure it so far, which already proved his great strength.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that persisting until the last moment would be impossible. The dark clouds up above had only diminished to half their original size, which meant that the World Energy baptism was only halfway through.</p>
<p>No one was optimistic about him! Even Luo Hai looked regretful and stopped paying attention.</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai had spoken confidently just now, he too was secretly worried for Elder Qian.</p>
<p>He had never encountered this kind of scene before, so he was somewhat uncertain.</p>
<p>However, he had faith in Qian Tong as well as the treasure he had given to him at the last moment!</p>
<p>Ordinary people couldn’t appreciate Shadowed Star’s cultivators’ desire to reach the Origin King Realm. Under the suppression and restriction of Shadowed Star’s World Principles, no one had been able to break through to the Origin King Realm for over ten thousand years. So more than any, Shadowed Star’s cultivators yearned for this unreachable peak.</p>
<p>Just in terms of strength of conviction, Qian Tong would not lose to anyone.</p>
<p><em>Kacha…</em></p>
<p>Another terrifying wave of power washed down and poured into Qian Tong’s body, shredding it from the inside while also cleansing it in a brutal and uncaring manner.</p>
<p>Inside this swirling chaotic energy, Qian Tong’s weak vitality was clearly in danger of being annihilated!</p>
<p>Lin Yu Rao screamed and her beautiful face paled. Unable to help herself, she covered her mouth with her hands.</p>
<p>Yang Xiu Zhu and Chu Han Yi Mo Yu also wore extremely dark faces!</p>
<p>“It’s no good, it’s no good! It seems he really will fall short,” Old Jiu shook his head regretfully. “This person’s luck was simply too poor, otherwise he would have very likely broken through to the Origin King Realm, what a pity… Hm? Wait, what happened?”</p>
<p>Suddenly Old Jiu’s eyes widened as he stared straight ahead, as if he discovered something extraordinary.</p>
<p>The other Origin Kings also showed looks of surprise on their faces and began calling out.</p>
<p>“What? How come this person’s vitality is suddenly rising sharply?”</p>
<p>“Did he take some kind of Heaven-defying Spirit Pill? But what Spirit Pill can achieve such a miraculous effect?”</p>
<p>“Nonsense, how could there be any Spirit Pill that could bring a dead man’s vitality back to its peak in an instant? Not even an Origin King Grade Spirit Pill can accomplish this!”</p>
<p>“Strange, what was it he consumed then?”</p>
<p>The many Origin Kings were all at a loss, none of them understanding how Qian Tong’s vitality, which was about to disappear, suddenly blossomed back to full strength in an instant.</p>
<p>Even through the violent, chaotic energies swirling around, the potent vital aura of the man at its centre could be felt clearly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from afar, Qian Tong’s loud laughter rang out and his figure could be seen standing straight as a sword, staring arrogantly up at the sky as he shouted, “This old master hasn’t lived enough yet, how could he die in some foreign land? Heavens! If you have anything left you’d best use it now!”</p>
<p>Old Jiu and the others twitched as shock filled their eyes.</p>
<p>This person dared to challenge the power of Heaven and Earth when he was breaking through. Throughout the ages, there had never been such a crazy person.</p>
<p>Didn’t he know that the World Energy Baptism caused by his breakthrough had a level of consciousness?</p>
<p>Making such a provocation was akin to digging one’s own grave!</p>
<p>Sure enough, as soon as Qian Tong’s voice fell, the huge black clouds up in the sky began swirling fast and the booming thunder turned absolutely deafening.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, a huge vortex appeared above Qian Tong’s head.</p>
<p>Immediately after, a thick beam of energy shot out from the vortex and directly impacted Qian Tong!</p>
<p>Qian Tong’s miserable howls sounded again and his surging vitality was consumed at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>“This old ghost!” Old Jiu spat, not knowing what to say.</p>
<p>Luo Hai’s eyes also filled with light as he stared forward deeply, his expression somewhat moved.</p>
<p>The World Energy baptism seemed to be pouring down all at once in this giant beam of light and the dark clouds up in the sky were rapidly becoming smaller as a result.</p>
<p>Less than ten breaths of time later, the sky suddenly cleared up and the terrifying pressure and intense World Energy aura disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>In the distance, only Qian Tong’s figure stood straight, motionless!</p>
<p>From just looking, it was impossible to know whether he was alive or dead.</p>
<p>However, a potent Shi rapidly spread out from Qian Tong in the next instant, covering a radius of several hundred kilometres in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, this Shi contracted rapidly towards Qian Tong’s body.</p>
<p>As it shrank, it also seemed to undergo a kind of miraculous transformation…</p>
<p>Many Origin Returning Realm masters wrinkled their brows as they couldn’t see through the mysteries involved in this process, but the Origin Kings present all raised their brows and showed looks of surprise.</p>
<p>“Compressing his Shi into Domain, this person… unexpectedly succeeded!” The old woman surnamed Lei whispered.</p>
<p>Yang Kai, who had been paying attention to the movement of these Origin Kings, heard this and couldn’t help letting out a laugh.</p>
<p>He couldn’t infer anything from just the scene of Qian Tong’s breakthrough so he could only take clues from the Origin Kings present. Now hearing the words of the old woman surnamed Lei, he was immediately relieved.</p>
<p>Qian Tong was now a genuine Origin King Realm master!</p>
<p>Of course, compared with Luo Hai and the other established Origin Kings present, Qian Tong was still just a fledgeling; after all, perfecting his Domain would take more than a day or two to achieve.</p>
<p>Amongst the Origin Kings present, the one who had broken through most recently had done so over five hundred years ago. In other words, he had five hundred more years of experience than Qian Tong in tempering his own Domain.</p>
<p>Facing any of these masters, Qian Tong may not be able to last three breaths of time!</p>
<p>After thinking about it for a moment, Yang Kai flew high up into the sky, cupped his fists, and said loudly, “Everyone, although Elder Qian has just broken through to the Origin King Realm, it will take him some time to consolidate his cultivation. This Junior hopes that everyone will disperse now so as not to disturb Elder Qian’s mood. Although this is somewhat presumptuous, this Juniors asks for your understanding!”</p>
<p>Many cultivators glanced around at each blankly, knowing that Yang Kai was trying to drive them away.</p>
<p>However, without any of their previous disdain or disregard, the Origin Returning Realm masters present all turned around and left sensibly, a few of them even pausing to cup their fists to Yang Kai while offering some polite words of congratulations.</p>
<p>Before, they were able to ignore Yang Kai because they had a vast numerical advantage and superior strength, but now that this Qian Tong had become a genuine Origin King, if they were to act provocatively, wouldn’t that just be courting death?</p>
<p>No one dared to do this.</p>
<p>“Several Seniors, this…” Yang Kai next turned to the Origin Kings and asked questioningly.</p>
<p>“It’s fine, you don’t need to shoo us all away, this old master will take his leave here!” Old Jiu snorted, “But when your friend over there wakes up, please bring him to meet with this old master and his companions in the nearby city. He has just broken through and will surely have many questions he wants to ask, if he wishes, he may consult with us freely. We won’t be stingy with our experiences.”</p>
<p>“Yes, if we can be of assistance to him, we will offer it freely,” The old woman surnamed Lei also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“Junior will replace Elder Qian in offering his thanks to several Seniors then,” Yang Kai respectfully nodded.</p>
<p>The Origin Kings glanced at each other before their figures flickered and disappeared.</p>
<p>Yang Kai clearly saw Luo Hai glance at him before leaving, however.</p>
<p>This place was really not suitable to remain at for long!</p>
<p>“Brother Yang, I’ll also take my leave here, I hope that one day you and I will have the chance to meet again,” Xu Bin Bai cupped his fists to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Take care, Brother Xu!” Yang Kai nodded. Although he felt Xu Bin Bai was a good person and someone worthy of making friends with, now was not the time to be thinking about such things so he did not try to delay him.</p>
<p>Soon, only Yang Kai and his party were left above the once noisy wilderness.</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze didn’t leave either. At this moment, he was looking towards Qian Tong in the distance with envy, secretly worrying about whether he would ever reach such a height. He and Qian Tong had entered the Blood Prison together and experienced it together, but Qian Tong had managed to break through while he only felt that he had made some improvements in his Shi and a turning point to reach the Origin King Realm was still far away.</p>
<p>“City Lord Zhao,” Yang Kai walked over to Zhao Tian Ze and spoke.</p>
<p>“Does Sect Master Yang have some kind of instruction?” Zhao Tian Ze asked.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t dare issue instructions, but… I’m afraid we will have to leave soon.”</p>
<p>“Leave?” Zhao Tian Ze was stunned, “Where will you go?”</p>
<p>“Back to Shadowed Star!” Yang Kai said in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Why are you leaving so hurriedly?” Zhao Tian Ze looked puzzled. Even Yang Xiu Zhu and the others turned curious looks towards Yang Kai, “Didn’t those Seniors just invite Elder Qian to go visit them, why…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Zhao Tian Ze frowned, seemingly realizing something.</p>
<p>Yang Kai couldn’t easily explain the truth of the situation, so he simply said, “Elder Qian will definitely not join them. If he won’t join, why bother going to see them? Moreover, just now, I also refused their offers, so although they didn’t say anything, they will no doubt have some discomfort in their hearts. If Elder Qian now refuses them again, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not become angered.”</p>
<p>“They wouldn’t….” Zhao Tian Ze broke out into cold sweat.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t believe that those Origin Kings would be so petty, Yang Kai’s words also had some truth to them.</p>
<p>“It is better to act cautiously in these circumstances. As such, after Elder Qian awakens, we will leave Green Mountains Star immediately!”</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze nodded lightly and sighed, “That’s a pity, this Zhao also wished to invite Sect Master Yang to visit my Green Water City to rest for a few days.”</p>
<p>“There will be a chance in the future,” Yang Kai chuckled, “For now though, this Junior will have to trouble City Lord Zhao with something.”</p>
<p>“Please name it, Sect Master Yang, this Zhao will definitely live up to your expectations,” Zhao Tian Ze quickly said. In the Blood Prison, Yang Kai had not paid any mind to his previous suspicions and even allowed him to return to study the mysteries of Domain Stone Mountain. After that, he had saved Zhao Tian Ze’s life, so Zhao Tian Ze was eager to repay these favours.</p>
<p>“Can I ask City Lord Zhao to go back to Green Water City and bring Qian Yue to me?”</p>
<p>“Little Qian Yue?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze was no stranger to Qian Yue. When Yang Kai left Green Mountains Star, Qian Tong and the other Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators had stayed behind, but Qian Yue had also remained, hoping to inquire about news of Su Yan, Qing Ya, and her other companions from Ice Sect.</p>
<p>Now that Yang Kai was going to leave, he couldn’t just leave her behind.</p>
<p>“Not a problem, this Zhao will set off immediately. Within seven days, this Zhao will definitely bring little Qian Yue here!” Zhao Tian Ze promised, and after saying some goodbyes to Yang Xiu Zhu and the others he flew off.</p>
<p>“Sect Master, why are you so anxious?” Yang Xiu Zhu looked at Yang Kai somewhat puzzled. He could feel that Yang Kai was on edge but did not know why.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1620, Blocked</h2>
<p>“If it was just about rejecting those people’s offers, Sect Master wouldn’t be so anxious. This is a matter of personal choice, so even if they felt uncomfortable, they wouldn’t sully their own reputations by acting wickedly.”</p>
<p>“It’s not just about this,” Yang Kai shook his head, “The matter of them trying to win us over isn’t of concern, what I’m worried about is something else.”</p>
<p>“What?” Lin Yu Rao asked.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid someone has set their eyes on us,” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched.</p>
<p>There were various signs that Green Mountains Star’s Star Master, Luo Hai had some understanding of what transpired inside the Blood Prison. This was related to an Origin Essence Crystal, so Yang Kai didn’t dare act carelessly.</p>
<p>If the Origin Essence Crystal was still in his hands, everything would be fine. At worst, he could simply hand it over to Luo Hai to keep everyone safe, but now the Origin Essence Crystal was no longer in his possession, as he had already given it to Yu Xiong.</p>
<p>Having lost this bargaining chip, how could Yang Kai dare to remain here any longer?</p>
<p>If not for Qian Tong still needing some time to emerge from his current state, Yang Kai would have left immediately.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t explain in detail, but from his tone and demeanour, Yang Xiu Zhu and the others could infer that the matter was serious, so they didn’t ask anymore and simply decided to follow Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Qian Tong was still standing in the distance, motionless, most likely immersed in some kind of comprehension.</p>
<p>With nothing else to do for now, Yang Xiu Zhu and the others sat down cross-legged to meditate and digest their harvests from the Blood Prison trip.</p>
<p>Although they did not obtain a chance to break through to the Origin King Realm like Qian Tong, it didn’t mean they gained nothing. On the contrary, everyone had obtained significant benefits, and as long as there were enough opportunities in the future, they still had a chance to be able to reach the Origin King Realm.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression changed constantly as various thoughts flashed across his mind. He kept imagining different situations which might happen in the coming days and was planning out how to cope with them.</p>
<p>Time passed slowly, and three days later, Zhao Tian Ze returned with Qian Yue.</p>
<p>After seeing Yang Kai, Qian Yue was naturally extremely happy, but when she remembered that she had been searching for clues on Green Mountains Star for several years but found nothing related to Su Yan and the other’s whereabouts, Qian Yue couldn’t help feeling depressed.</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze did not stay long; after delivering Qian Yue here, he hurried back to Green Water City.</p>
<p>When the Blood Prison opened this time, he had entered together with the Vice City Lord of Green Water City. Unfortunately, the Vice City Lord, who was also a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master, fell inside the Blood Prison.</p>
<p>This was a serious matter.</p>
<p>Zhao Tian Ze needed to return to Green Water City promptly to choose a new Vice City Lord.</p>
<p>Time flowed on, and another five days later, Qian Tong’s laughter rang out, prompting all the waiting people to look over in his direction.</p>
<p>In a flicker, Qian Tong appeared in front of everyone with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Congratulations Elder Qian,” Yang Xiu Zhu cupped his fists and congratulated.</p>
<p>“Elder Qian has successfully broken through to the Origin King Realm. This is a grand event my Shadowed Star has not witnessed in over ten thousand years! Shadow Moon Hall will definitely rejoice, as will all cultivators on Shadowed Star,” Mo Yu chuckled.</p>
<p>“All of you are too serious,” Qian Tong shook his head. “This time this Qian barely managed to escape death. If not for Yang Kai, I would have fallen long ago rather than broken through.”</p>
<p>Saying so, he turned to look straight at Yang Kai, “Yang Kai, this old master owes you another favour!”</p>
<p>At that time, if it wasn’t for the item inside the jade bottle Yang Kai gave him, which allowed him to rapidly strengthen his vitality and heal his wounds, how could Qian Tong have persisted until the end?</p>
<p>Qian Tong knew that what Yang Kai gave him was Life Revitalizing Jade Cream! He and Fei Zhi Tu had seen it once before after all.</p>
<p>Together with Soul Cleansing Divine Water and Immortal Source Liquid, these treasures were known as the Star Field’s Three Great Divine Waters, and every drop was incredibly precious.</p>
<p>The bottle Yang Kai gave him, however, had at least twenty drops inside of it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that his breakthrough being successful was due in large part to Yang Kai’s assistance.</p>
<p>“Elder Qian is too polite,” Yang Kai chuckled, “Good, this isn’t a place to stay and talk, it’s important we leave quickly.”</p>
<p>“Leave now?” Qian Tong frowned.</p>
<p>“Now!”</p>
<p>“Okay!” Qian Tong didn’t raise any objections and simply followed Yang Kai’s lead.</p>
<p>“There are too many of us to move quickly, come in first!” Yang Kai said, summoning the Sealed World Bead.</p>
<p>Everyone knew what Yang Kai meant and they naturally cooperated, relaxing their guards and not resisting.</p>
<p>Yang Kai opened the Sealed World Bead and in a flash of light, almost everyone was pulled into it.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to bring this old master in,” Qian Tong smiled lightly, “I just made a breakthrough, so this old master would like to feel the surrounding World Principles for a while longer.”</p>
<p>Hearing what he said, Yang Kai didn’t want to force him, simply nodding and reminding, “Sure… But if there is any danger…”</p>
<p>“This old master is now an Origin King, what possible danger could there be?” Qian Tong laughed, not paying it much mind.</p>
<p>A trace of anxiety appeared between Yang Kai’s brow, but he didn’t try to explain, instead just signalling to Qian Tong, summoning his Star Shuttle, and setting out towards the Starry Sky.</p>
<p>While they were still on Green Mountains Star, Yang Kai didn’t dare to summon the Starship casually. Once an Origin King Grade Starship appeared, Luo Hai would immediately be alarmed.</p>
<p>The speed of the two was extremely fast, and while Yang Kai was filled with worries, Qian Tong was feeling quite spirited, feeling everything around him and even showing a thoughtful expression now and then.</p>
<p>The moment they set out, in a city thousands of kilometres away, inside the City Lord’s Mansion, Old Jiu and the other Origin Kings were chatting amongst themselves, exchanging their cultivation experiences while passing the time.</p>
<p>They had all remained here because they wanted to meet with Qian Tong!</p>
<p>Qian Tong was a newly promoted Origin King, and they all thought that the other party would come to find them; after all, each Origin King would have many things they did not understand after they broke through, and if someone was willing to answer their questions, they would naturally not want to miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>None of them had expected Yang Kai to act so decisively and immediately leave Green Mountains Star.</p>
<p>Luo Hai was sitting at the head of the room, occasionally speaking a few words which would garner him the admiration of Old Jiu and the others present.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Luo Hai frowned and revealed a look of surprise.</p>
<p>“Sir Luo Hai, what happened?” The old woman surnamed Lei looked at him and asked curiously.</p>
<p>“This King has something he must deal with, excuse me!” Luo Hai said before his figure flickered and disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>“What matter would require Brother Luo Hai to suddenly just disappear?” Old Jiu and the others looked at each other at a loss.</p>
<p>“From the look on his face, it seems something major has happened. Could some kind of accident have occurred here?”</p>
<p>“It couldn’t be. Brother Luo Hai is Green Mountains Star’s Star Master, so who would dare act presumptuously here, on his home turf!?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, haha, it seems I am overthinking things. On the other hand, why hasn’t that newly promoted Origin King arrived yet? “We’ve been waiting here for several days now, he couldn’t have run away, right?”</p>
<p>“Why would he try to run? We have no malicious intent towards him and can even teach him some of our experiences for free. As long as he is not a fool, he would not reject such a good offer.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s continue waiting.”</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>Above Green Mountains Star, Yang Kai and Qian Tong flew out as swift as the wind, trying to escape from the star’s radius.</p>
<p>Suddenly, however, Qian Tong frowned and shouted, “Yang Kai!”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai turned to look at him.</p>
<p>“I feel as if I‘m being watched!” Qian Tong frowned, expanding his Divine Sense like a tide but failing to notice anything, making him even more puzzled.</p>
<p>He had just made a breakthrough and was feeling quite proud of himself, so suddenly feeling like this was quite uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Pretend like you haven’t noticed anything!” Yang Kai used his Divine Sense to silently tell him.</p>
<p>“Yang Kai, do you know something?” Qian Tong also replied with his Divine Sense.</p>
<p>“I have a fair idea!” Yang Kai’s face turned ugly, “If I’m not mistaken, it is Green Mountains Star’s Star Master Luo Hai who is staring at us!”</p>
<p>“Him!?” Qian Tong’s face changed drastically, “Why would he be looking for us?”</p>
<p>“Not us, me!” Yang Kai smiled bitterly, “He thinks I have something he needs.”</p>
<p>“What should we do then?” Qian Tong asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Being stared at by such a master caused even Qian Tong to start panicking. While he was now an Origin King, he had only broken through a few days ago. As for Luo Hai though, he was a master at the Second-Order Origin King Realm as well as the Star Master of Green Mountains Star.</p>
<p>Qian Tong had no doubt that on Green Mountains Star, if this opponent wanted to take his life, he could do so with a wave of his hand.</p>
<p>“We need to quickly leave this damned place. As long as we escape from the constraints of Green Mountains Star’s World Principles, Luo Hai will be nothing but an ordinary Second-Order Origin King! Only then will we have a chance to survive,” Yang Kai declared clearly.</p>
<p>Qian Tong heard this and nodded lightly.</p>
<p>As long as they were beyond the reach of Green Mountains Star’s World Principles, Luo Hai would not be so terrifying and they may be able to escape from him.</p>
<p>Thinking so, the pair increased their speed greatly.</p>
<p>“You want to leave Green Mountains Star?” In the distance, Luo Hai seemed to be aware of their intentions and grinned faintly, “A good idea, but you are far too naive.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and gently grabbed forward, causing a strange change in the atmosphere as he did.</p>
<p>Yang Kai and Qian Tong, who were tens of thousands of kilometres away, suddenly had their faces go pale and their bodies come to a halt, like they had been struck by lightning.</p>
<p>Looking out towards the endless Starry Sky, Yang Kai grit his teeth secretly and desperately pushed his Saint Qi and Shi, trying to get rid of the invisible shackles binding him, but to his shock, he was still completely incapable of moving.</p>
<p>It was as if the surrounding space had been frozen solid.</p>
<p>This was the power of a Star Master!</p>
<p>[Just a bit further!]</p>
<p>Yang Kai could feel that he and Qian Tong only needed to travel a bit further to escape Green Mountains Star’s World Principles, but at this last moment, they were actually blocked.</p>
<p>Qian Tong seemed to be in a better condition than Yang Kai, at least he could still circulate his Saint Qi properly and glance around while shouting, “Who’s there!”</p>
<p>A figure appeared silently not far in front of Yang Kai and Qian Tong, with a golden crown on his head and a golden robe covering his body. Naturally, it was Luo Hai.</p>
<p>Shooting a glance towards Qian Tong indifferently, a hint of approval flashed across his eyes.</p>
<p>As a freshly broken through Origin King, even though Qian Tong’s realm was not yet stabilized, being able to remain even somewhat mobile was quite a feat. If given enough time, Qian Tong would surely reach the Second-Order Origin King Realm.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t pay too much attention to Qian Tong and quickly turned his gaze back towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>His main purpose for coming here was Yang Kai!</p>
<p>Above that patch of wilderness, there were too many people around and it would not have been appropriate for him to act against Yang Kai, but now that these two had left Green Mountains Star and come to the edge of the Starry Sky, Luo Hai could act without restraint.</p>
