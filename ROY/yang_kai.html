<h2>After Xue Li left, one of her subordinates grinned and sharply said, “If you have anything to say, hurry and say it. Don’t make me wait, I don’t have much patience.”</h2>
<p>Saying so, he too walked out of the hall.</p>
<p>Only Yang Kai and An Ling’er remained now.</p>
<p>The Nine Heavens Holy Land Saintess quickly came over and asked Yang Kai about his present condition, a thick meaning of concern and worry in her voice. Yang Kai repeatedly a.s.sured her he was fine and then asked her how she was doing.</p>
<p>An Ling’er smiled bitterly and replied, “Senior Xue hasn’t mistreated me so far, she only has me accompany her and take care of some minor tasks, so you don’t need to worry about me. More importantly… Why did you refuse Gou Qiong’s offer to redeem us?”</p>
<p>“Do you think I shouldn’t have refused?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but that Xue Li is not a good person, I’m afraid if we remain here we’ll encounter danger sooner or later.”</p>
<p>“She is not a good person, but neither is Gou Qiong,” Yang Kai coldly snorted, “I refused because I want to keep control of my own life.”</p>
<p>“Ah? Why do you say that?” An Ling’er was lost.</p>
<p>Yang Kai explained carefully, “If I accepted his ransom, it that means I will owe him my life. No matter what kind of excessive demands he makes, I won’t be able to refuse.”</p>
<p>“But… you also saved Gou Che’s life. If you take that into consideration, shouldn’t the two things offset one another?”</p>
<p>“You’re still so silly,” Yang Kai knocked her head lightly, “That’s the biggest problem here.”</p>
<p>An Ling’er rubbed her forehead while staring at Yang Kai as if she had been greatly wronged, “I don’t get what you’re saying, explain it clearly.”</p>
<p>“Haa…” Yang Kai looked at her and shook his head, “You being able to grow up must not have been easy. You must thank your Nine Heavens Holy Land for keeping you inside the Sect all these years, if you had gone out on your own, I don’t know how many times you’d have died already.”</p>
<p>An Ling’er pursed her lips unhappily.</p>
<p>“I saved Gou Che, that life-saving grace should have become something we could rely on to leave the Demon Land, but now it’s actually a fatal problem. Think about the ident.i.ty of Gou Che: His father is Gou Qiong, a Demon General. Didn’t Xue Li say this when we first met, ‘A solemn Demon General heir actually needing a human to save his life…’”</p>
<p>“The meaning of that statement was that he should not have been saved by me, or at the very least, he shouldn’t have been saved by a human. If I really accepted Gou Qiong’s ransom and allowed him to redeem us, within a few days, both you and I will wind up dead in some roadside ditch!”</p>
<p>“Ah!” An Ling’er yelped as she covered her mouth.</p>
<p>“The best way for Gou Qiong to not let news of this disgrace spread out is to silence all the witnesses to the crime. With no evidence, no one will know that his son had been saved by a mere human,” Yang Kai smiled coldly, a dangerous light flickering across his eyes.</p>
<p>“Isn’t all that just your speculations?” An Ling’er was somewhat unable to believe what she just heard.</p>
<p>“It’s not a guess, it’s a fact!” Yang Kai concluded, “Gou Qiong is not a generous man, so how could he suddenly be kind enough to redeem his son, a stranger, and two humans? You should know that the amount of ransom he paid was not small, clearly he has an ulterior motive… If my guess is right, on the way to Gou Che’s home, there are already masters waiting for us in ambush. Once we show up, all that will be waiting for us is death!”</p>
<p>An Ling’er tender body trembled as a sense of escaping from certain doom suddenly overcame her.</p>
<p>“This point, Xue Li was also well aware of! But she didn’t make any effort to inform us. That woman really is sinister…” Yang Kai gnashed his teeth.</p>
<p>“No wonder when you refused she smiled so weirdly, so it was like that,” An Ling’er suddenly realized; at the same time, she also felt a great sense of admiration for Yang Kai.</p>
<p>If it had been just her instead, she would likely have happily left with Gou Che, happily fantasizing about how Gou Qiong would thank her for saving his son, not realizing the hidden murderous intent behind all of this!</p>
<p>As a hint of fear flashed across her eyes, a sense of anger also welled up inside her, “Gou Che, that ungrateful dog, how could he not have known how his father thinks?”</p>
<p>“Hmph, he couldn’t be clearer,” Yang Kai sneered.</p>
<p>“You should have left him to rot in that Mysterious Small World!” An Ling’er cursed furiously.</p>
<p>“That was my mistake, I wanted to borrow his ident.i.ty and status; unfortunately, it seems trying to be clever actually made me into a fool. Well, at least it wasn’t a total loss; he did bring us out of that desert. Without him, we might have been lost in that place for the rest of our lives. Even if we had made it out, we probably would have been chased down by other Demon Race cultivators instead of standing here comfortably in Sand City right now.”</p>
<p>Everything has its pros and cons, it all depends on how one thought about it.</p>
<p>Gou Che had truly acted cold and ruthless, but Yang Kai had never been sincere towards him either, so there was nothing to really be disappointed about.</p>
<p>Yang Kai slowly shook his head, “Let’s not talk about this anymore. Right now, we need to consider how to survive while still in Xue Li’s hands. Since you’re by her side, pay attention and observe her carefully, see if there’s something we can use, perhaps some casual discovery will prove to be a breakthrough point for us.”</p>
<p>“En,” An Ling’er nodded firmly, feeling a kind of solidarity and shared sense of destiny with Yang Kai.</p>
<p>As they were speaking, Xue Li’s subordinate called out to them from outside the hall, urging them to hurry up, so Yang Kai quickly said goodbye to An Ling’er and departed and was returned to his room again.</p>
<p>Time pa.s.sed and everything was quiet.</p>
<p>Since Yang Kai rejected Gou Qiong’s ransom that day, he seemed to have been forgotten by Xue Li, and before he knew it, two months had gone by.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was also happy with the status quo for now; besides meditating and cultivating throughout the day, he spent his time communicating with the Divine Tree.</p>
<p>After several months, the Divine Tree’s consciousness had matured greatly, and it was now possible for Yang Kai to hold simple conversations with it.</p>
<p>From Yang Kai, the Divine Tree had learned a lot, and its wisdom was still growing rapidly. Today, it possessed ability equal to that of a six or seven-year-old child; besides being slightly mischievous, everything about it was excellent.</p>
<p>The Divine Tree was now rooted in the Black Book s.p.a.ce and Yang Kai could supplement his own Yang Qi and Spiritual Energy from it any time or place. It was as if Yang Kai was carrying a ma.s.sive storage s.p.a.ce of energy with him which was extremely convenient to use.</p>
<p>After two months of dedicated cultivation, Yang Kai’s strength had increased significantly.</p>
<p>One day, when Yang Kai’s Soul Avatar dove into the Black Book s.p.a.ce, he found something out of place.</p>
<p>The rare ores he had stored in the Black Book s.p.a.ce seemed to have decreased in number somewhat.</p>
<p>These ores were collected from the last time Yang Kai entered the Starry Sky. After pa.s.sing through the Starry Sky Storm, he had found many precious ores left behind from the Asteroid Sea. He wanted to use these ores to create some powerful artifacts, but had never had time to find a suitable Artifact Refiner.</p>
<p>Yang Kai wasn’t too clear about the exact quant.i.ty of these ores, but after checking it over a few times, there were indeed fewer than he remembered.</p>
<p>In the place where he had been keeping them, there was some scattered gravel remaining. These leftovers were completely composed of impurities. In other words, the essence of the original ores had been consumed, leaving only dregs behind.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was puzzled and quickly used brought his Soul Avatar into the Divine Tree’s core to ask it about it.</p>
<p>Yang Kai thought that the Divine Tree had secretly absorbed the essence from these ores but after hearing his question, the Divine Tree actually shook its head and said it had done no such thing.</p>
<p>Yang Kai laughed dumbly at this response and didn’t ask again.</p>
<p>The consciousness of the Divine Tree was only equivalent to that of a child, it was only normal for it to lie a little about such things at this age.</p>
<p>Yang Kai naturally didn’t have any intention to blame it, if the Divine Tree needed these ores, he would happily give all of them to it.</p>
<p>“Good, if these stones are useful to you, you can use as many as you want, you don’t need to ask me first. Right, there is also a pool of medicinal liquid over there, you can absorb one drop of it every day, it may help your growth.”</p>
<p>The Divine Tree rejoiced slightly and immediately reached out a branch towards the pool of Myriad Drug Liquid and took a drop, a moment later releasing a long, satisfied sigh.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai smiled warmly, but soon after he noticed that someone was approaching his room so he quickly informed the Divine Tree before returning his consciousness back to his body.</p>
<p>Just as he opened his eyes, the door was pushed open and Xue Li’s subordinate waved towards Yang Kai indifferently, “Get out, Mistress wants to see you.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned for a moment but refrained from asking anything and quickly followed the man out.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t know what this man’s exact cultivation was, but from the pressure he felt and how highly Xue Li’s trusted the latter, it was likely this man was a Saint Realm master.</p>
<p>The Demon Race was generally longer lived than those of the Human Race, so from appearance alone, this person didn’t seem very old. He looked like a handsome thirty-year-old man who constantly had an arrogant expression on his face.</p>
<p>Only when he was in front of Xue Li would this man restrain himself, not daring to act prideful in the slightest.</p>
<p>“Friend, how should I address you?” Yang Kai asked suddenly.</p>
<p>The man turned his head and stared at Yang Kai for a moment before chuckling, “Mistress said your courage wasn’t small, it seems she was right! Boy, you don’t seem to have the awareness a prisoner should have.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders and replied casually, “Although I have indeed been confined by you, since you haven’t done anything to me after so long, it means that I still have some use to you. Why should I act anxiously for no reason?”</p>
<p>“Seems your head isn’t too bad either, good, I like it!” The man laughed before saying, “Call

<p>“Seems your head isn’t too bad either, good, I like it!” The man laughed before saying, “Call me Yu Mo.”</p>
<p>“The names of your Demon Race people are really weird…” Yang Kai shook his head.</p>
<p>“I think the names of your humans are the weird ones!” Yu Mo grinned.</p>
<p>“What does your Mistress want from me this time?” Yang Kai asked again.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, maybe she thinks you no longer have any value and has decided to kill you,” Yu Mo grinned as he took pleasure in Yang Kai’s misfortune, continuing scornfully, “You’d better prepare yourself, otherwise you may find yourself lacking a head without even knowing why.”</p>
<p>The corner of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched slightly but he managed to maintain his indifferent expression somehow.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yu Mo nodded secretly, feeling like this little brat was indeed somewhat different. Any average person would probably be panicking after hearing such words, but this boy actually still looked quite carefree.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Yu Mo nodded secretly, feeling like this little brat was indeed somewhat different. Any average person would probably be panicking after hearing such words, but this boy actually still looked quite carefree.</p>
<p>In the same hall as before, Xue Li was waiting, but An Ling’er did not appear this time.</p>
<p>Yu Mo brought Yang Kai here, bowed respectfully, and then stood to the side, staring at the latter coldly.</p>
<p>Xue Li nodded lightly, lifted her eyes and swept Yang Kai, calmly saying, “I’ve kept you alive until today, are you ready to create some value for me?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned, “What are you referring to?”</p>
<p>Xue Li laughed lightly before slowly standing up and continuing, “I told you before, my Sand City does not raise wastes! Since I allowed you to live, naturally I have a use for you. Good, a First Order Transcendent, it’s not easy to acquire such cultivation at your age. You should be a Core Disciple of some big force, yes?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai neither confirmed nor denied.</p>
<p>“Well that doesn’t matter to me. I don’t care which force you are from, since you’ve fallen into my hands, you have no choice but to obey me. If you dare to defy my commands… you know the consequences…”</p>
<p>Saying so, her beautiful misty eyes flashed a cold light.</p>
<p>“What do you want me to do then?” Yang Kai asked calmly.</p>
<p>“Kill! Or being killed!” Xue Li giggled and said, “Yu Mo, explain to him carefully, it’s time for him to make his debut.”</p>
<p>Sitting her perfectly shaped bottom back down on her luxurious chair, Xue Li a.s.sumed a lazy positing while staring at Yang Kai faintly.</p>
<p>Yu Mo straightened his back and spoke to Yang Kai next, “The land around Sand City is barren, and the other places governed by Mistress Xue Li are not any more bountiful, even the World Energy is thin in her lands! Moreover, because this place is close to the vast desert, hardly any traders pa.s.s through here, so it is reasonable to say that General Xue Li’s territory should be very poor.”</p>
<p>“Could it be that it isn’t?” Yang Kai tilted his head and asked.</p>
<p>Yu Mo grinned and continued, “Not only is it not poor, on the contrary, the richness of Sand City is unmatched by any city in the Demon Land. The wealth that flows in and out of this place every year is simply incalculable.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai raised his brow, somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>Yu Mo looked at Yang Kai proudly, thinking this little brat would ask why, but after waiting for an awkward amount of time and seeing him not have any such intention, Yu Mo grew annoyed and said, “Because Sand City has something that can attract all of the Demon Land’s people. This one feature has made Sand City the most popular among all the Demon Land, even the other three Demon Generals have temporary residences here!”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling somewhat interested, “What kind of place can attract so many people?”</p>
<p>“The Death Arena!” Yu Mo grinned, “Simply put, it is a stage that allows cultivator within the same round to engage in life or death contests. Masters from all over bet Crystal Stones or materials on the compet.i.tor they fancy, and if that person wins, they can gain a certain amount of income. The odds are all different for each contest and the gains are not fixed. If your luck is good enough, you can win a dozen times what you initially bet!”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that just gambling?”</p>
<p>“En!”</p>
<p>“And the banker is your Sand City? If that’s so, you will profit either way,” Yang Kai grinned.</p>
<p>“We also need to cultivate, and that requires materials and supplies, but this territory is too poor, so we can only find ways to gain profits from those wealthy people’s pockets.”</p>
<p>“So you want me to fight, right?”</p>
<p>“Good. Recently in the fights, we’ve had a string of bad luck and have lost quite a few Crystal Stones. You are a First Order Transcendent, so although you’re not much to look at, if you play your role right, we should still be able to recover some of our losses,” Yu Mo nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Are there any benefits in it for me?” Yang Kai asked.</p>
<p>“You actually want benefits?” Yu Mo snorted.</p>
<p>“Of course, you want me to fight with my life on the line, don’t tell me there aren’t any benefits for me in this at all?” Yang Kai replied as if it were only natural.</p>
<p>“Interesting. Mistress, what do you think?” Yu Mo looked over at Xue Li and asked.</p>
<p>“Give him a little something.”</p>
<p>Yu Mo nodded his head in acknowledgement, turning back to Yang Kai and saying, “Since Mistress has said so, as long as you can let us win, we’ll give you a share of the profits.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded lightly, “Good.”</p>
<p>He then turned to Xue Li and asked, “If I can collect enough money this way, will you let me buy my freedom?”</p>
<p>Xue Li’s opened her eyes slightly, stared at Yang Kai coldly, and then closed them again before saying, “That will depend on my mood. If you behave well, I might consider it, but if you dare try to bargain back and forth or raise any fuss, I’ll immediately kill you. Yu Mo, test his ability. He better not just be trash that can only talk big.”</p>
<p>As soon as she spoke those words, a terrible pressure burst from Yu Mo’s body and engulfed Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s body bent and his knees sank, almost falling to the ground in that instant. Realizing the tyrannical force this aura contained, Yang Kai’s expression changed greatly as he madly circulated his True Qi to resist the pressure coming from Yu Mo.</p>
<p>“Hm?” Yu Mo was also greatly surprised by this development. From the moment he had laid eyes upon him, he had not liked Yang Kai, so he wanted to take this opportunity to teach this human boy a harsh lesson and have him beg for mercy. Yu Mo had wanted to let Yang Kai fall to the ground and eat dirt, crus.h.i.+ng the always indifferent look on the latter’s face, so he was quite surprised when this little brat actually withstood the pressure he applied.</p>
<p>His eyes flas.h.i.+ng a cold light, Yu Mo increased the pressure he was emitting again.</p>
<p>Yang Kai let out a grunt and his body once again began sinking, his knees bending further as his face turned red, clenching his teeth as he glared angrily towards Yu Mo.</p>
<p><em>Kacha…</em></p>
<p>The white jade floor suddenly shattered and cracks spread out from the position Yang Kai was standing, causing the hall’s walls to creak slightly from the load.</p>
<p>Xue Li also finally opened her eyes and stared deeply at Yang Kai, a look of antic.i.p.ation appearing on her pretty face, as if she wanted to see just how the latter would resist Yu Mo.</p>
<p>Under Yu Mo’s terrifying aura, Yang Kai’s body quivered and blue veins began appearing on his skin, but after ten breaths of time, he seemed to have adapted to the pressure and his body slowly began straightening up again.</p>
<p>Yu Mo’s look changed upon seeing this. He was clearer than anyone about how much power he was using. Under such pressure, forget a First Order, even a strong Second Order Transcendent cultivator shouldn’t have been able to put up any kind of struggle, only a Third Order would barely be able to resist.</p>
<p>But this little brat had actually managed to do just that, although it was obvious it wasn’t easy for him to do so.</p>
<p>Coldly snorting, Yu Mo’s increased his power for the third time.</p>
<p><em>Ka…</em></p>
<p>Yang Kai’s legs sank into the ground all the way to his knees this time.</p>
<p>At that moment though, Yang Kai made a move, his body lifting off the ground like an arrow shot from a bow, True Yang Yuan Qi gathering in his hands as rapidly approached Yu Mo. The True Yang Yuan Qi conjugated to summon out a large golden sword in his hands, and before he could reach Yu Mo, Yang Kai had already swung it down.</p>
<p>Murderous intent flashed across Yu Mo’s eyes and his own Demonic Qi took on a dangerous aura.</p>
<p>“Enough!” Xue Li lightly said, her voice echoing throughout the hall.</p>
<p>Like an invisible shockwave hit him, Yang Kai’s body suddenly came to a halt and the Profound Heavenly Sword held in his hand shattered into pieces and disappeared into the wind.</p>
<p>Yu Mo’s quickly took back his strength before frowning towards Yang Kai who was standing nearby, coldly asking, “Boy, were you trying to kill me just now?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai only grinned back at him fiercely.</p>
<p>“Yang Qi, an annoying Qi as always!” Xue Li frowned, seemingly unhappy.</p>
<p>Although with her cultivation there was no way Yang Kai’s True Yang Yuan Qi could have any kind of suppressive effect on her, it was still repulsive to her, like fire and water. The Demonic Qi within her body was naturally rejecting Yang Kai’s True Yang Yuan Qi.</p>
<p>“Your strength isn’t bad, this King has apparently been looking down on you,” Xue Li nodded lightly. Being able to persist for so long under Yu Mo’s pressure and even daring to fight back at the last moment, trying to kill the latter, this human boy’s combat power and willpower far surpa.s.sed what his present cultivation realm suggested was possible!</p>
<p>As a Saint Realm master, Xue Li’s vision would not be mistaken on this point.</p>
<p>“Mistress, we can make good use of this,” Yu Mo swept Yang Kai indifferently, a sinister glint flas.h.i.+ng across his eyes.</p>
<p>“Good, it’s time we made those b.a.s.t.a.r.ds bleed,” Xue Li smiled coldly, “Arrange a match for him tomorrow, I want him to obtain victory after a difficult struggle!”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Yu Mo snickered as he looked at Yang Kai like a wild wolf eyeing a lamb.</p>
<p>“I have another request!” Yang Kai cracked his shoulders and quickly added before Xue Li could get angry, “This is the last one!”</p>
<p>“Say it!” Xue Li said unhappily.</p>
<p>“Give me an artifact that can change my appearance. I don’t want my true face to be seen by too many people, or there will be a lot of you demons chasing me in the future,” Yang Kai said.</p>
<p>Xue Li was startled for a moment but quickly recovered, grinning as she said, “You think quite far ahead.”</p>
<p>As long as Xue Li managed things properly, Yang Kai could bring her a great deal of wealth and all the Demon Race powerhouses she scammed wouldn’t dare direct their anger at her, so naturally their grievances would land on Yang Kai. That meant that even if he were to gain his freedom from Xue Li, he wouldn’t likely be able to escape the Demon Land alive.</p>
<p>Yang Kai already had such an artifact, the one Du Wan gave him.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t dare to use it; after all, that was the artifact he had used to change his appearance when he harvested the medicinal liquid of the Thousand Year Demon Flower. Once someone recognized that, it would bring him even more trouble, so he could only ask Xue Li for something similar.</p>
<p>“I don’t have an artifact like that,” Xue Li shook her head, “But I can give you a mask, just use that to cover your face.”</p>
<p>“Good enough!” Yang Kai nodded.</p>
<p>“Take him away! Have a good rest tonight, you better not die tomorrow!” Xue Li laughed.</p>
<p>Yu Mo brought Yang Kai back to his room again but before leaving used several seals on his True Qi. In an instant, Yang Kai felt as if his True Qi flow had slowed several times over and even his movements were somewhat sluggish.</p>
<p>“Do you know why I did this?” Yu Mo asked.</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently nodded, not putting up any resistance. From what Xue Li had just said, it was easy to infer that she wanted him to fight a desperate battle tomorrow in order to fool the eyes of those rich Demon Race masters, causing them to misjudge his strength. That way, in the future, they underestimate Yang Kai’s strength, bet against him, and lose their money, allowing Xue Li to profit.</p>
<p>Without Yu Mo applying these seals, Yang Kai was likely to expose some of his strength mistakenly. The Demon Race powerhouses that were betting weren’t blind, so even a slight upsurge of strength would cause them to realize that something was amiss.</p>
<h2>The Death Arena was the biggest feature of Sand City, many great characters from all corners of the Demon Land would raise fighters or captured slaves and arrange them to fight life or death battles in the Death Arena.</h2>
<p>There were no rules or restrictions. As long they were a member of the Demon Race, they were eligible to enter and partic.i.p.ate.</p>
<p>Regarding the naturally cruel and bloodthirsty Demon Race, this was undoubtedly very attractive. They could enjoy these blood-stained battles while also gambling and earning Crystal Stones, so the Death Arena’s was always quite popular, and for this reason, Sand City was able to gather a great amount of wealth and supplies all year round.</p>
<p>Among the four Demon Generals, Xue Li was undoubtedly the wealthiest.</p>
<p>Yu Mo gave a simple explanation about the Death Arena to Yang Kai and then left.</p>
<p>With nothing to do overnight, Yang Kai simply adjusted himself to his peak condition.</p>
<p>The next day, at noon, Yu Mo came again and led Yang Kai out.</p>
<p>Leaving the giant palace, Yu Mo flew towards a certain position in Sand City where a huge ring-shaped arena had been set up.</p>
<p>The venue’s setup was not poor and at its centre was a giant stage surrounded by a variety of st.u.r.dy barriers. Around this stage were a ma.s.sive number of seats. Currently, these seats were filled with Demon Race spectators who were watching a battle between two cultivators on the centre stage.</p>
<p>The strength of these two cultivators wasn’t very high, but the fight was quite fierce, both of them covered in b.l.o.o.d.y scars, each of them glaring hatefully towards the other. The two repeatedly used their artifacts and Martial Skills to hack, pierce, and slash at their opponent, dying the surroundings dark red.</p>
<p>When the battle finally came to an end, the crowds in the stands cheered raucously.</p>
<p>Yang Kai watched the whole situation calmly with an expression of indifference.</p>
<p>Yu Mo turned to him and sneered, “When your turn comes, you’ll fight an opponent with a similar cultivation, but unlike you, he’ll be able to use his full strength. Right now you can probably only use half your strength, so you best be careful. Although I don’t care whether you live or die, Mistress hopes you can bring her some wealth, so you best not disappoint her.”</p>
<p>“I know!” Yang Kai nodded lightly.</p>
<p>When the two of them arrived here, from the highest point in the stands, a cold look shot towards them. Yang Kai looked back and saw Xue Li sitting there, with An Ling’er standing by her side.</p>
<p>When their four eyes met, An Ling’er couldn’t help wanting to call out to Yang Kai, but Xue Li immediately gave her a stern look.</p>
<p>Receiving this silent warning, An Ling’er didn’t dare to say anything, and Yang Kai also shook his head, indicating to her that she shouldn’t act rashly.</p>
<p>Having arrived at the Death Arena, Yu Mo led Yang Kai to a poorly lit underground tunnel and walked inside.</p>
<p>After arriving at the end of the tunnel, a faint light shone from up ahead, and a ramp leading to the interior of the Death Arena appeared.</p>
<p>A group of Xue Li’s subordinates were waiting here and when Yu Mo arrived, they all respectfully greeted him.</p>
<p>“Sir Yu Mo, is this the little human brat that’s fighting this time?” Asked a man with a sallow complexion.</p>
<p>“Good, the announcements have been made and the odds are set,” Yu Mo nodded lightly.</p>
<p>The yellow-faced man snickered as he swept his eyes over Yang Kai, snickering under his breath, “Boy, best stay alert, your opponent isn’t one to be taken lightly, he’s won three times already, most cultivators in the same realm as him can’t even last as long as it would take an incense stick to burn. Well, try not to die too pitifully out there.”</p>
<p>“We’ll talk about it again if he’s able to last an incense stick worth of time,” Yang Kai replied indifferently, not showing the slightest bit of panic.</p>
<p>“Ho…” The yellow-faced man was surprised for a moment before he sneered again, “Where did this little brat come from, acting so arrogant. Hah, grandpa here would like to see just how you plan to kill your opponent within an incense worth of time!”</p>
<p>Yu Mo also glanced over at Yang Kai and coldly snorted, obviously feeling like Yang Kai was boasting shamelessly. Although he had personally tested Yang Kai’s strength and knew this human boy wasn’t ordinary, now that the latter could only use half his full strength, even being able to survive would be questionable. As for such big talk, Yu Mo thought Yang Kai was simply overreaching himself.</p>
<p>Yang Kai no longer said anything and just waited quietly.</p>
<p>Inside the Death Arena, the battle between the two cultivators had already reached a conclusion. One person had been dismembered, the other had been crippled. Some people immediately came out and cleaned up the stage. The winner was now a disabled waste, so after quickly consulting with the Death Stage’s administrators, the cleanup crew, obviously used to dealing with such situations, directly killed him before disposing of his corpse.</p>
<p>As blood stained the ground once more, cheers erupted from the stands again.</p>
<p>After waiting for the cleanup to finish, Yu Mo turned to Yang Kai and nodded, “It’s your turn, remember what Mistress said yesterday!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent, simply accepting the mask Yu Mo had prepared for him, covering his face, and stepping forward.</p>
<p>From the ramp on the opposite side of the stage, another man slowly walked out as well. This man was bare chested and had huge, rippling muscles, his entire physique seemingly containing a kind of explosive power. In comparison, Yang Kai, who was a head shorter, appeared somewhat scrawny.</p>
<p>As this compet.i.tor approached, a murderous intent rose from him like a fierce storm, seemingly wanting to tear Yang Kai limb from limb with just his aura alone.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai remained unmoved, like a ten thousand year old reef. When the murderous intent struck him, it was as if it took the initiative to separate and flow past him.</p>
<p>High up in the stands, many people showed an interested look, thinking this life or death battle should be very exciting. An Ling’er, who was standing next to Xue Li, also silently gripped her fists and watched nervously.</p>
<p>A moment later, the fighters came to a stop less than ten meters apart and stared down one another.</p>
<p>The burly man opposite Yang Kai also seemed to be a human who had the misfortune of being captured by the Demon Race. According to Yu Mo, most of the cultivators that entered the Death Arena were prisoners like Yang Kai. In order to save their own lives, they chose to fight here. Others had taken the initiative to hire themselves to wealthy Demon Race masters specifically to partic.i.p.ate in the Death Arena, using it as an opportunity to gain benefits and status. Still others were specially trained by certain powerhouses for the explicit purpose of fighting here.</p>
<p>No matter what reason they had for entering the Death Arena though, there was ultimately only one objective – killing the enemy!</p>
<p>“Boy, cowering behind a mask, are you too ashamed to show others your true face? Hah, if you kneel down to give I, your grandpa, three kowtows, I’ll give you a painless death!” The brawny man shouted, his voice like booming thunder, causing Yang Kai’s ears to ring.</p>
<p>The burly man’s outburst wasn’t just meant to intimidate Yang Kai though; it also contained a subtle Divine Sense attack. If Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea defences were lax and this Divine Sense attack managed to affect his Soul, he would instantly lose all will to fight and would end up being suppressed by his opponent, unable to even resist.</p>
<p>However, such a low-level trick obviously wouldn’t work against Yang Kai, his aura not even rippling as he simply stared back at the burly man indifferently, slowly examining his body while circulating his True Qi.</p>
<p>Thanks to Yu Mo, Yang Kai’s current True Qi circulating speed was greatly reduced, and his own reaction speed had become much slower. Without lifting the seals placed on him, it would be impossible for Yang Kai to bring out his peak strength.</p>
<p>But Yang Kai still felt it wouldn’t be too difficult to handle this loud man.</p>
<p>“Boy, are you deaf?” The brawny man cried out once more.</p>
<p>Just as he shouted though, the burly man saw Yang Kai’s figure flicker and a pointed murderous intent rapidly approach him from the side. The big man’s eyes flashed a cold light as his mouth curled into a provocative grin but didn’t make any attempt to dodge.</p>
<p><em>Hong…</em></p>
<p>A dull thud resounded as Yang Kai’s punch hit his opponent’s ribs, but the burly man actually remained in place, his body as hard as an iron plate. In fact, it was Yang Kai who felt pain from the rebound of his fist hitting the other side!</p>
<p>The strength of this burly man was quite good! Yang Kai immediately realized why his opponent was able to win three games in the Death Arena. The combat experience and ability of this brawny man was obviously far beyond what an ordinary cultivator possessed. If it weren’t, he would have died long ago in this forsaken place.</p>
<p>His initial strike having no effect, there wasn’t even time for Yang Kai to withdraw before the big man smirked and responded. At some unknown point, the burly man had lifted his hand up high, condensed his entire body’s True Qi into it, and swung it down mercilessly.</p>
<p>As his hand chopped down, the ma.s.s of True Qi burst out, transforming this knife-hand into the equivalent of a great hammer strike.</p>
<p>This attack has not even arrived yet the entire Death Arena’s stage sunk from the pressure, showing just how horrifying the power of this strike was.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes flashed and he responded somewhat clumsily, unable to withdraw his fist in time.</p>
<p>The next moment, the burly man’s knife-hand chopped directly onto Yang Kai’s arm.</p>
<p>With a crisp sound, Yang Kai’s arm broke and limply fell to his side. It was only then that Yang Kai managed to retreat and open up some distance between him and his opponent.</p>
<p>From the stands, hisses of shock could be heard.</p>
<p>These Demon Race masters who were spectating the mask wearing Yang Kai’s match had noted his calm appearance at the start and thought he possessed some kind of special skill, but now seeing his arm broken so easily, they were obviously disappointed.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>An Ling’er screamed as a look of worry flashed across her pretty face.</p>
<p>Xue Li’s gaze sharpened as she stared at Yang Kai down below, grinning slightly.</p>
<p>Atop the Death Arena’s stage, Yang Kai, who had his arm broken just now, had only just regained his footing when the burly man rushed in front of him, two black arcs of lightning swirling around his arms, giving him a fierce appearance.</p>
<p>From his st.u.r.dy body, a b.l.o.o.d.y and brutal aura burst forth as a cold light concentrated in the palm of his hands.</p>
<p>Immediately, on the burly man’s palms, two black lightning-like b.a.l.l.s of energy the size of washbasins appeared, emitting a thick murderous aura.</p>
<p>Both his palms struck towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Surges of lighting erupted!</p>
<p>The burly man clearly wanted to kill Yang Kai with this one strike!</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t have any ability to resist and under the pressure of the black lightning which came at him from both left and right, he couldn’t even dodge. In the blink of an eye, his whole body had been struck by countless palms, turning into a scared and b.l.o.o.d.y mess, making him look quite miserable.</p>
<p>The boos from the stands grew even louder.</p>
<p>What the crowd wanted to see was a b.l.o.o.d.y battle, not a one-sided slaughter.</p>
<p>The performance of Yang Kai really made one want to curse, and the unlucky Demon Race masters who had placed bets on him made no attempt to hide their dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Even Xue Li’s brow wrinkled slightly, her expression growing colder by the moment.</p>
<p>She suddenly thought that Yang Kai’s earlier performance was nothing but a freak accident and that his real ability wasn’t that good. If that wasn’t the case, how could he be so pathetic in front of a cultivator in the same realm?</p>
<p>If he continued to take this a.s.sault like this, he wouldn’t survive long!</p>
<p>[Another waste!] Xue Li’s coldly snorted to herself, gradually losing all interest in Yang Kai.</p>
<h2>Fresh blood stained the ground and Yang Kai looked more and more distressed. On the other hand, his opponent only became fiercer, trying to capitalize on his current advantage.</h2>
<p>The burly man struck mercilessly, sending Yang Kai flying up into the sky with a punch to his jaw, then knocking him into the ground as soon as he fell back down.</p>
<p>Dust flew everywhere and no one was able to see what was happening on the battlefield. On top of that, because of the multi-layered barriers around the Death Arena’s stage, even the Saint Realm masters in the audience couldn’t gain anything more than a vague impression with their Divine Senses. All anyone could tell was that the fight had come to an end.</p>
<p>[How boring!] Many people thought to themselves.</p>
<p>However, before they could start grumbling out loud, a burst of murderous intent filled the air and a gust of wind burst forth, expelling all the dust from the stage.</p>
<p>After everyone saw the situation in front of them, they couldn’t help calling out in shock.</p>
<p>Yang Kai, who should have fallen to the ground and been beaten to death, at that moment, had used his unbroken arm to grab hold of his opponent and pin him to the stage.</p>
<p>That hand was firmly gripped the back of the burly man’s neck, like a great vice, and no matter how the latter struggled, he couldn’t break free.</p>
<p>No one saw what happened just now, all they knew was when the dust scattered, this scene had appeared before them, it was truly surprising.</p>
<p>They had seen before Earth shattering counter attacks launched at the last moment in order to win a battle, but never once had a situation as strange or confusing as this one occurred.</p>
<p>As silence filled the arena, the mask worn by Yang Kai’s face seemed to give off a cold glint.</p>
<p>Wind and Thunder Qi surged up in Yang Kai’s palm and then poured into the burly man, forming a killing storm inside his body.</p>
<p><em>Peng…</em></p>
<p>In the next instant, the big man’s strong body directly burst into a b.l.o.o.d.y fog, not even leaving behind any bones!</p>
<p>High up in the stands, Xue Li’s beautiful eyes lit up as a hint of surprise flashed across them. She hadn’t thought Yang Kai would put on such a strange and wonderful performance, her thin red lips curling into a grin.</p>
<p>“How great is his real strength?” Xue Li suddenly whispered to An Ling’er.</p>
<p>“I won’t tell you!” An Ling’er shook her head repeatedly.</p>
<p>“You won’t tell me?” Xue Li didn’t get angry and instead showed a thoughtful expression while flas.h.i.+ng a playful smile, “Then I’ll just have to figure it out myself.”</p>
<p>Turning her eyes back to the Death Arena below, Xue Li watched the scarred and broken armed Yang Kai walk step by step towards the exit, thinking to herself that this human brat she had randomly picked up was indeed out of the ordinary!</p>
<p>In the stands, after a long silence, an eruption of noise burst out, most people complaining loudly about this nonsensical result, discussing what exactly had just happened.</p>
<p>When Yang Kai returned to the dark ramp, Yu Mo’s eyes flashed a cold light as he stared fixedly at him.</p>
<p>As for the yellow-faced man, he just dumbly stood in place, his eyes almost bulging out of their sockets.</p>
<p>After less than the time it would take to burn a stick of incense, this arrogant little human boy had really killed his opponent.</p>
<p>“Did the match look difficult enough for you?” Yang Kai took off the mask and shot a glance towards Yu Mo.</p>
<p>Yu Mo’s mouth twitched once before he nodded lightly.</p>
<p>Not only did the match appear difficult, it was quite realistic, without the slightest flaw. Even Yu Mo thought that Yang Kai was dead, only to be surprised at the last moment.</p>
<p>[This boy’s courage really isn’t normal. Wasn’t he even slightly worried about taking so many attacks head on?]</p>
<p>Yang Kai tightened his muscles and with a crisp sound his broken arm snapped back into place.</p>
<p>“Next time, arrange a Second Order Transcendent opponent for me, that way I can earn more profits. The sooner I acc.u.mulate enough wealth, the sooner I can go free!” Yang Kai grinned.</p>
<p>Yu Mo couldn’t help feeling a bit annoyed suddenly.</p>
<p>Returning Yang Kai to the palace, Yu Mo then left to allow the former to recuperate.</p>
<p>After this time’s victory, Yang Kai’s treatment also improved greatly. Many good dishes to help him recover his stamina and strength were served to him and An Ling’er even received permission from Xue Li to visit him once.</p>
<p>The two of them talked for quite some time before An Ling’er left.</p>
<p>After a three day interlude, Yang Kai’s second bout was scheduled.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of his bizarre performance last time, when the masked Yang Kai appeared again, he attracted a lot of attention.</p>
<p>This time, his opponent was a genuine Second Order Transcendent.</p>
<p>After a hard fight, Yang Kai barely managed to escape death and obtain a come-back victory, causing all the Demon Race spectators cry out in surprise, none of them able to believe what they had just seen.</p>
<p>Defeating someone in a higher realm was a feat not many could achieve, especially after one reached the Transcendent Realm where each Minor Realm represented a ma.s.sive increase in combat power.</p>
<p>Normally, a Second Order Transcendent cultivator would easily be able to put a First Order Transcendent to death, but this common sense was actually flipped on its head by Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Just like last time, Yang Kai’s True Qi had been restricted by Yu Mo’s sealing technique, so he wasn’t able to display his full strength, so unlike the act he had put on before, this time Yang Kai really was fighting desperately.</p>
<p>In a life or death struggle, Yang Kai was able to grasp many things he had been unable to before, causing him to somewhat rejoice. He felt fighting such a desperate battle was of great benefit to his growth.</p>
<p>As such, Yang Kai didn’t actually feel much resentment about having to partic.i.p.ate in these fights and was instead almost looking forward to it.</p>
<p>This was a rare opportunity for him to temper himself!</p>
<p>The growth of a cultivator couldn’t be separated from reality, fighting real life or death battles would often bring one more benefits than simply remaining in secluded retreat. Of course, this was premised on being able to survive such fights.</p>
<p>After thoroughly understanding this, Yang Kai began urging Yu Mo to arrange stronger opponents for him!</p>
<p>Yu Mo was dumbfounded and often stared at Yang Kai as if he was staring at someone screwed loose in the head. He had never seen a captured prisoner like Yang Kai actually requesting to fight more often in the Death Arena.</p>
<p>Xue Li on the other hand was quite open-minded, arranging fights for Yang Kai whenever he requested them.</p>
<p>The strength of Yang Kai’s opponents also continuously increased, causing him to suffer more and more hards.h.i.+ps with each pa.s.sing bout. But each time it looked like it was all over for him, Yang Kai would somehow pull off a miracle and win.</p>
<p>(PewPewLazerGun: Plot Armour… get some!)</p>
<p>(Silavin: Well, not really Plot Amour when he has done it multiple times by now. I think his actual strength is at Saint Stage already but barely at that level.)</p>
<p>Over the next three months, Yang Kai fought a total of fourteen times on the Death Arena’s stage. All fourteen of his opponents were Second Order Transcendents. Some were from the Human Race and Monster Race, while there were still others belonging to the Demon Race, each of them competing in this blood sport for one reason or another, but all of them eventually finding defeat at Yang Kai’s hands.</p>
<p>Through these life or death battles, Yang Kai reaped a huge harvest, not only gaining a greater understanding of his own strength, but also all the acc.u.mulated insights into the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao of his defeated opponents after he devoured the remnants of their Souls.</p>
<p>The rate at which his strength grew could only be described as astonis.h.i.+ng.</p>
<p>After three months of repeated fights, Yang Kai had also inadvertently become something a celebrity, there was basically no one who lived in Sand City that didn’t know of him. Xue Li’s masked human subordinate who, despite only having a First Order Transcendent cultivation, had killed more than a dozen Second Order Transcendents.</p>
<p>In the Death Arena, the odds of Yang Kai winning changed over and over again, but this still couldn’t stop others from betting on him with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Xue Li, as the arena’s banker, naturally wouldn’t lose money in this kind of gambling, but seeing Yang Kai’s horrifying rate of growth caused her some suspicion.</p>
<p>She, compared to anyone else, understood what was happening, how Yang Kai was achieving his rapid increase in strength by constantly defying death in combat.</p>
<p>One day, a messenger arrived at Xue Li’s palace and requested an audience. After meeting with Xue Li for some time, the messenger finally departed with a satisfied look upon his face.</p>
<p>An hour later, Yang Kai was summoned.</p>
<p>Inside a side hall, Xue Li was lying upon a great bed, her perfectly shaped bottom facing upwards as her proud peaks were squeezed beneath her body, her chin resting gently upon her hands, a most stimulated posture.</p>
<p>An Ling’er was half-kneeling beside her while ma.s.saging Xue Li’s shoulders.</p>
<p>There was a delicate, mature fragrance lingering about the hall that tickled one’s nose.</p>
<p>Yu Mo brought Yang Kai into the hall, bowed, and then moved to the wall, not daring to lay eyes upon Xue Li.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yang Kai stood at the edge of the bed and swept his eyes over Xue Li’s wondrous body.</p>
<p>This Demon General was as vicious as a snake, but it was undeniable that she was a great beauty filled with mature charm, unlike An Ling’er who still retained a kind of youthful innocence.</p>
<p>Such a woman had a fatal enticement to any man.</p>
<p>However, a character like Xue Li probably would not be tempted by any man, the only thing that could move her was strength, overwhelming and all conquering strength!</p>
<p>After waiting for quite some time, Xue Li suddenly said, “Gou Qiong sent me a messenger a moment ago.”</p>
<p>“Hm?” Yang Kai’s brow wrinkled, “Is it related to me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Gou Qiong seems to want to kill you.”</p>
<p>“Then how did you reply?” Yang Kai looked at her coldly as he mockingly asked, “Don’t tell me you agreed to sell me?”</p>
<p>“This King indeed thought about it, but I still refused him!”</p>
<p>“Why is that?”</p>
<p>“Because he is Gou Qiong!” Xue Li sneered, “If he wants something, obviously I won’t happily comply; however, his messenger made an interesting proposal which I did agree to.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t ask anything and just waited for her to explain.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, on the Death Arena’s stage, you’ll fight someone sent by Gou Qiong! If you win, you’ll be able to earn enough ransom money to free yourself. If you lose, you’ll have nothing, including your life!” Xue Li said lightly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai raised his brow and snickered, “The fighter sent by Gou Qiong shouldn’t be weak, right?”</p>
<p>Xue Li glanced at him teasingly and nodded, “A Third Order Transcendent!”</p>
<p>Hearing this, even Yu Mo, who had been keeping his head down to the side, also showed some response.</p>
<p>“Seems you two are collaborating to put me to death,” Yang Kai grinned wryly, not showing the slightest sign of panic.</p>
<p>“He indeed wants you dead, but I, I want to know where your limit is!” Xue Li’s pretty face became slightly cold, “Don’t think this Queen doesn’t know you’re still concealing your true strength, it seems you still have a lot of cards you’ve yet to play!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders, not acknowledging or denying her speculation.</p>
<p>“Therefore I am very much looking forward to your performance tomorrow, don’t disappoint me.”</p>
<p>“You’ll just have to wait and see!”</p>
<p>Xue Li sneered lightly, calling out to Yu Mo next, “Remove all the seals on him, I want to see if he can survive against Gou Qiong’s p.a.w.n!”</p>
<p>Yu Mo nodded lightly, quickly revolving his True Qi and lifting the seals that had been dampening Yang Kai’s strength.</p>
<p>“I have a question. If I win tomorrow’s match, you said I’d have collected my own ransom. What about An Ling’er?”</p>
<p>Xue Li looked at him and grinned, “Of course you’ll only have collected enough for yourself, but… I can give you a chance. If you win tomorrow, I’ll let both of you go!”</p>
<p>“You’ve said so yourself!” Yang Kai laughed, “A Demon General’s words should be credible, yes? I hope you won’t go back on them!”</p>
<p>Xue Li closed her eyes and made no response.</p>
<h2>The surrounding earth was dyed completely red from the countless lives which were reaped here, traces of battles wherever one looked. This was the Death Arena!</h2>
<p>A number of Demon Race powerhouses who had access to inside information were already waiting in the stands early today. After watching a few fierce battles, a masked human slowly came out of the underground ramp.</p>
<p>In an instant, the arena was filled with cheers.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, Yang Kai had shown many thrilling and suspenseful battles to these demons, making him famous throughout Sand City.</p>
<p>Today, the battle between Yang Kai and another master was the ultimate finale.</p>
<p>Because there were rumors that his opponent this time was different from the past, it was actually a Third Order Transcendent master!</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Death Arena, there had never been a match between two opponents with such a great disparity in cultivation realms. With two Minor Realms separating the fighters, in the eyes of those who were uninformed, the result was a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>But for those who had seen Yang Kai’s dozen plus battles, there were still some who had hopes he would create a miracle one again!</p>
<p>Hatred between different races played no role here, because Yang Kai’s performance was just that astounding, providing the very height of entertainment to the Death Arena’s loyal customers.</p>
<p>“Is this the little human brat who has won more than a dozen matches in the Death Arena, the one who barely survives each time?” In the stands, a Saint Realm master with sharp eagle-like eyes turned to the man beside him and asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, Senior Feng Biao. His performance is really outstanding, even the elite juniors from our Demon Race are far inferior to him!” The person next to him replied immediately.</p>
<p>“Hmph, after today, he’ll be nothing but another corpse!” Feng Biao coldly snorted, looking as if he was quite reluctant to allow Yang Kai to continue breathing.</p>
<p>“What Senior says is absolutely right… After all, his opponent is different from the previous one,” The man nodded repeatedly, suddenly lowering his voice as if he had some concerns, “But Senior, he is the champion trained by Senior Xue Li, if we really kill him and Senior Xue Li decides to blame us…”</p>
<p>“She won’t,” Feng Biao shook his head decisively, “This fight was set up at Sir Gou Qiong’s request. I negotiated with Xue Li personally yesterday and reached an agreement that no matter what happens today she will not hold us responsible!”</p>
<p>The man heard this and suddenly showed a somewhat confused expression, wondering why General Gou Qiong was so concerned about this Human.</p>
<p>Only a small number of people knew that the son of Gou Qiong was saved by Yang Kai. Feng Biao had been sent here this time specifically to deal with this issue once and for all, but he had been ordered to keep his mouth shut about the details, so even the subordinates he had brought didn’t know the whole story.</p>
<p>Although Xue Li was no friend of Gou Qiong’s, she also wouldn’t do something as petty as spreading such a story around to shame the latter, she was only interested in confronting Gou Qiong head on!</p>
<p>“Senior, that Yu Mo is coming!” The man whispered suddenly.</p>
<p>Feng Biao’s eyes narrowed as he glanced up to see Yu Mo flying towards him from a distance, the latter landing next to him a moment later and sitting down casually.</p>
<p>Both of these two were First Order Saints and served Demon Generals who were at odds with each other, so naturally there was no goodwill between them.</p>
<p>As their four eyes met, it was as if invisible sparks filled the s.p.a.ce between them.</p>
<p>“Yu Mo, it’s been so long since I last saw you!” Feng Biao greeted with a cold look upon his face.</p>
<p>Yu Mo smiled back lightly and replied, “Feng Biao, even after not seeing you for so long, I still can’t get used to your face. Every time I see your dumb look, it makes me want to kill you!”</p>
<p>“Same to you!” Feng Biao sneered back, his True Qi slowly beginning to condense, his hostility filled eyes glaring towards Yu Mo.</p>
<p>Yu Mo curled his lips at that moment and continued, “This time I haven’t come here to pick a fight with you, I just want to ask you something.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Looking at you, it seems that you’re quite confident about today’s battle!”</p>
<p>“Hmph, saying something so obvious!”</p>
<p>“My Sand City’s Death Arena promotes gambling. If you’re so confident, why not make a bet with me. When the battle is over, you may be able to pick up some extra benefits that way!”</p>
<p>“Do you think you need to remind me of that?” Feng Biao said with obvious displeasure, “I’ve already bet 200,000 Crystal Stones!”</p>
<p>Yu Mo wore an expression of surprise and said, “Worthy of Feng Biao, such boldness! It seems you want to take my Sand City for all its worth.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you handle even that little?” Feng Biao smiled contemptuously, “If I can’t afford it, I can withdraw right now, as long as you, Yu Mo, in front of everyone, bow down and apologize to me!”</p>
<p>“You must be joking, since Sand City has opened this business, naturally, no matter how big the bet, we can swallow it. In fact, I just wanted to ask you, since this is such a rare opportunity, why not wager some real money?” Saying so, Yu Mo shot a provocative look towards Feng Biao.</p>
<p>In response, Feng Biao narrowed his eyes and asked, “Real money?”</p>
<p>“En, how about wagering everything you own. If I remember correctly, you have a number of good artifacts on you, right?”</p>
<p>Feng Biao frowned as he stared suspiciously at Yu Mo, coldly saying, “Seeing you like this, it appears you have quite some confidence in that human boy.”</p>
<p>“Think whatever you’d like. Maybe he’ll win, maybe he won’t, but whether you gamble or not is up your own courage!”</p>
<p>Feng Biao stared at him deeply. Although he knew that this guy, who was always as incompatible with him as fire was with water, was provoking him, he couldn’t back down now and simply nodded “Good, then I’ll bet all my artifacts as well!”</p>
<p>Saying so, he flicked his wrist and a glowing chainmail armour, a long halberd with a shocking aura, and a jet black saber appeared in front of Yu Mo.</p>
<p>These three items were all Saint Grade artifacts, each one of them a priceless treasure. These artifacts were the ones Feng Biao most valued and frequently used. If he were to lose them in this time’s gambling, his combat effectiveness would drop significantly.</p>
<p>After handing over these three Saint Grade artifacts, Feng Biao even took down his Universe Bag from his waist and tossed it over to Yu Mo, saying as he did so, “If we’re going to do this, we might as well do it thoroughly, what do you say?”</p>
<p>Yu Mo’s eyes brightened, didn’t speak any nonsense, and simply smiled, turned around, and left.</p>
<p>Feng Biao didn’t make any attempt to stop him nor did he ask any question. Although the two of them weren’t on friendly terms, they would still abide by the verbal agreement they had reached.</p>
<p>A moment later, Yu Mo returned to Xue Li.</p>
<p>“Is everything arranged?” Xue Li looked down at Yang Kai who was standing in the middle of the Death Arena and asked softly.</p>
<p>“Good, Feng Biao put out all his belongings,” Yu Mo nodded lightly, frowning in the next instant, “Mistress, are you really so confident about that little brat? To be honest, although his previous performances were quite surprising, this time I honestly don’t favour him. It’s quite likely he’ll die here. Him dying isn’t a big deal, but with Feng Biao gambling so much money, when that boy dies, it will be a big loss to Sand City.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know!” Xue Li’s said as she shook her head and some slight confusion flashed across her eyes.</p>
<p>Yu Mo was immediately dumbstruck.</p>
<p>As one of the four Demon Generals, a master that had few equals throughout the world, Xue Li naturally had extremely profound insight and vision, but this time it seemed like even she was uncertain about the situation.</p>
<p>“I am also gambling here. Although from any reasonable perspective, that little brat is undoubtedly a dead man, but…”</p>
<p>Saying so , Xue Li turned to look at An Ling’er who had been standing there silently the whole time and smiled slyly, “From beginning to end, this little girl hasn’t shown any signs of concern.”</p>
<p>Yu Mo couldn’t help turning to look at An Ling’er and indeed found that this was the case. Even though this little human girl knew Yang Kai would be facing a very strong enemy today, her expression remained calm.</p>
<p>Xue Li had obviously realized some information from An Ling’er’s behaviour.</p>
<p>“I asked her several times what the true extent of that boy’s strength was but she always refused to answer me. But that only makes me even more curious!” Xue Li reached out and gently stroked An Ling’er’s face, scaring the latter terribly.</p>
<p>“Tell me, has he ever fought with such an opponent before?” Xue Li suddenly asked in a solemn tone.</p>
<p>An Ling’er’s beautiful eyes became dull in that instant but quickly recovered their light as a look of struggle appeared on her face, the scene of her and Yang Kai being chased down by Saintess Nan and facing off against the Sun Clan’s masters in that Mysterious Small World flas.h.i.+ng across her mind.</p>
<p>Even so, An Ling’er wore a pained expression as she somehow managed to shake her head.</p>
<p>Xue Li reluctantly sighed, “Her willpower is also quite remarkable, it seems she’s cultivated a very powerful Secret Art.”</p>
<p>“However, just from how she responded now, it’s fairly obvious that boy down there had fought against such a master before and managed to survive, otherwise she wouldn’t have been so relaxed just now.”</p>
<p>“En,” Xue Li nodded lightly, “If this time he still doesn’t die, in the near future, he will definitely become the most dazzling person in the entire realm. At that time, he may even exceed the strength of the Demon Commander and become a supreme existence!”</p>
<p>Yu Mo’s body trembled lightly, “Does Mistress really evaluate him so highly?”</p>
<p>“He has the potential!” Xue Li categorically said, a trace of cold killing intent flas.h.i.+ng across her beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s a pity that such a person is not a member of our clan. If he was a member of the Demon Race, he would be worth cultivating,” Yu Mo had been following Xue Li for many years so he naturally knew what she was thinking right now and couldn’t help feeling a bit distressed.</p>
<p>Such astonis.h.i.+ng apt.i.tude only made this human boy a bigger threat, if such a genius was not killed early, it would inevitably have a significant negative impact on the entire Demon Race in the future.</p>
<p>As such, today, this little brat’s fate had already been decided, because even if he were to win this fight, Xue Li planned to kill him.</p>
<p>Looking down at the Death Arena’s stage where Yang Kai was silently waiting for his opponent to appear, Yu Mo sincerely pitied him.</p>
<p>After a long wait, Yang Kai’s opponent finally appeared. This person looked like he was walking in a leisurely manner but his speed was actually extremely fast, and in just the blink of an eye, he was already standing in front of Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Wearing plain black robes which could be found in any ordinary shop, this man had a majestic yet cold aura which was perfectly highlighted by his jet black shoulder length hair and profound gaze.</p>
<p>A surging malevolent intent pulsed from this man’s body and his Demonic Qi was incomparably pure; obviously, he was a lot stronger than an ordinary Third Order Transcendent master.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as his heart sank somewhat.</p>
<p>Even with just a glance, he could tell that his opponent was no easily pinched persimmon, this time he would have to go all out if he wanted to win.</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai had his Soul Devouring Insects and was thus not afraid of any opponent under the Saint Realm, this situation was different. In front of so many Demon Race masters, he couldn’t expose his Soul Devouring Insects, so he could only defeat his opponent head-on.</p>
<p>Moreover, Yang Kai also wanted to test just how much he had grown during this period of time.</p>
<h2>As Yang Kai was observing his opponent, his opponent was also observing him, his eyes focused intently as if they were trying to see through all this masked youth’s secrets.</h2>
<p>Although the man couldn’t see Yang Kai’s face, he could feel the murderous intent pulsing from the latter’s body. This aura was extraordinarily rich and not the slightest attempt to conceal it was being made. Even facing an opponent whose realm far exceeded his own, the eyes of this masked youth only showed a burning desire to fight.</p>
<p>This was no ordinary opponent!</p>
<p>This man only observed Yang Kai for a moment before coming to this conclusion, a hint of caution flas.h.i.+ng across the depths of his eyes.</p>
<p>With such a ma.s.sive gap in cultivation yet still being so eager to battle meant only one of two things, either this youth was absurdly arrogant or he had complete confidence in his ability!</p>
<p>Someone who could win more than a dozen fights in the Death Arena could not possibly be the first. If that was the case, he would have died long ago, but did that mean this little human brat thought he could actually put up a fight against a Third Order master with his puny First Order Transcendent cultivation?</p>
<p>The man suddenly felt that things had become interesting.</p>
<p>When Yang Kai’s opponent appeared, chatter erupted throughout the Death Arena’s stands. Many Demon Race cultivators pointing towards Yang Kai were pointing towards Yang Kai’s challenger with suspicion and excitement, many of them obviously recognizing the other’s ident.i.ty.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that Sir Gou Qiong’s subordinate Di Xiao?”</p>
<p>“It’s him. When I visited Qing Liao City before, I saw him once. It really is Di Xiao!”</p>
<p>“Why would he appear in the Death Arena?”</p>
<p>“It’s said that he is Sir Gou Qiong’s strongest fighter below the Saint Realm and that he is only one step away from breaking through and becoming a Saint.”</p>
<p>“This human boy versus Di Xiao, I’m afraid the outcome is set! Di Xiao’s strength isn’t comparable to an ordinary Third Order Transcendent. As Sir Gou Qiong’s vanguard, he has made many great achievements in battle and is said to even be able to hold his ground against a Saint Realm master for a short time.”</p>
<p>“En, what a pity. After today, I’m afraid we’ll never get to see this masked kid fight on the Death Arena’s stage again.”</p>
<p>“A trivial human boy, who cares if he dies? I hope Di Xiao kills him quickly, this little brat has acted arrogantly for long enough. Does he think no one in my Demon Race is his equal?”</p>
<p>“Good, good, although I enjoy watching him fight, he is, after all, a human.”</p>
<p>The whispering voices came from all over and reached Yang Kai’s ears, causing him to wrinkle his brow slightly. He hadn’t expected his opponent today to be so famous amongst the Demon Race.</p>
<p>Gou Qiong sending such a master to deal with him, it was obvious what kind of importance the former placed on this matter.</p>
<p>Di Xiao suddenly grinned and said, “Friend, although we come from different races, I heard that you have defeated more than a dozen Second Order Transcendent opponents, each time narrowly escaping death. I admire you quite a bit. If possible, I’d like to become friends with you, but since I was ordered by Sir Gou Qiong, this time I must take your life, when the time comes, please don’t blame me.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s brow moved slightly but didn’t speak, choosing to remain silent as always.</p>
<p>“Then… let’s get started!” Di Xiao cupped his fists as he said these words and then, in an instant, vanished like a ghost.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression changed dramatically.</p>
<p>Quickly retreating from where he was standing, Yang Kai fell back a couple dozen meters, clenched his fist, condensed his True Qi, and then struck the ground with an earth shaking force.</p>
<p><em>Hong…</em></p>
<p>The entire Death Arena stage trembled violently, the rippling waves only stopping once they reached the ring’s surrounding barriers.</p>
<p>A giant pit with a depth of several meters appeared in an instant.</p>
<p>From the pit, a flash of cold light shot out, as if it was tearing s.p.a.ce, ignoring all obstacles and distance and arriving in front of Yang Kai’s chest in the next instant.</p>
<p><em>Pu…</em></p>
<p>Like a blossoming red flower, blood splashed out as Yang Kai coughed, staggering back a few steps as he directed a dignified stare in front of himself.</p>
<p>On his chest, there was a longan sized wound which was leaking fresh blood even now, dying his robes a dull red.</p>
<p>Exclamations came from all directions as many eyes among the spectators flashed with surprise, shocked by Di Xiao’s tyrannical strength.</p>
<p>Everything happened too quickly. Di Xiao had used some kind of profound movement skill, vanished from in front of everyone’s eyes, snuck underground, then sent out a lightning fast attack that could pierce through any kind of defence and wounded Yang Kai before the latter had time to react.</p>
<p>Since his debut on the Death Arena stage, Yang Kai had fought more than a dozen times, and although each time he escaped from death he would become bruised and b.l.o.o.d.y, there was never a time as dangerous as just now. The match had only just begun yet he had already been injured by his opponent.</p>
<p>On top of that, this injury was not light, his face going slightly pale as he panted for breath, only able to steady himself some time later.</p>
<p>Di Xiao stood not far away, a smile upon his face, staring at Yang Kai as if he hadn’t ever moved; however, if one looked closely, they would notice a trace of dissatisfaction between his brows.</p>
<p>Di Xiao thought that even if his attack wasn’t able to kill Yang Kai, the latter would at least be wounded to the point where he would lose all ability to fight back; he hadn’t expected this human boy to actually only receive a light injury.</p>
<p>[This little brat… was somewhat strange! His physique seemed to be quite tenacious and had invisibly resolved most of the power of my strike.] Di Xiao evaluated</p>
<p>“Fierce!” Di Xiao expressed sincere admiration, “I never imagined someone like you existed among the Human Race!”</p>
<p>“You’re not too bad yourself!”</p>
<p>“Let’s try this again!” Di Xiao snorted, not giving Yang Kai any time to recover, a number of tornadoes suddenly appearing around him. These tornadoes were ma.s.sive and extended all the way up into the sky, throwing the entire Death Arenas stage into chaos.</p>
<p>The loose gravel on the ground was swept up in this whirling wind, making the tornadoes even more dangerous.</p>
<p>Next, an incredibly potent Demonic Qi burst from Di Xiao’s body and dyed the tornados pitch black.</p>
<p>At some unknown point, dark clouds appeared in the sky over the Death Arena, obscuring the sky and creating an especially dignified atmosphere.</p>
<p>Countless incomparably sharp wind blades appeared at the edges of the tornados, whirling about at incredible speed, slicing through everything they touched with ease.</p>
<p><em>Xiu xiu xiu…</em></p>
<p>In an instant, the wind blade had completely wrapped up Yang Kai, leaving him no path to Heaven, nor road to h.e.l.l.</p>
<p>Yang Kai let out a low roar and the earth beneath his feet abruptly collapsed. Next, at his fingertip, he condensed a drop of Yang Liquid and transformed it into the s.h.i.+eld which he then placed atop his head.</p>
<p>The wind blades struck in the next moment, bombarding Yang Kai from all directions, causing his True Yang Yuan Qi’s s.h.i.+eld to deform greatly. It was like Yang Kai was adrift the midst of a great storm, his boat constantly in danger of being destroyed, yet through this onslaught, Yang Kai remained unharmed, successfully resisting the innumerable wind blades.</p>
<p>All the Demon Race spectators up in the stands cried out in shock.</p>
<p>Yang Kai only had a First Order Transcendent Realm cultivation, yet he had actually been able to resist the powerful attack of Di Xiao, a genuine Third Order Transcendent powerhouse, without even suffering the slightest injury. This development made the audience quite uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Di Xiao was no ordinary Demon Race cultivator; he was one of Demon General Gou Qiong’s most trusted subordinates and could almost be considered the first person in the entire Demon Race below the Saint Realm.</p>
<p>The number of masters who had died at Di Xiao’s hands were countless; moreover, he was a talent Gou Qiong had personally taken an interest in, raising the former to become one of his future elites. As such, Di Xiao’s strength was not comparable to an ordinary Third Order Transcendent.</p>
<p>Even from up in the stands, the Demon Race cultivators could feel just how horrifying Di Xiao’s power was, yet such power couldn’t even break the True Qi s.h.i.+eld Yang Kai had hastily condensed, obviously this was an unexpected development.</p>
<p>“Mistress, he really does possess astonis.h.i.+ng potential!” Yu Mo called out, “In all the matches he fought up to now, he never displayed such means.”</p>
<p>Xue Li’s beautiful eyes flashed a cold light, “Only using his True Qi, he was able to withstand that attack, it’s obvious the purity and density of his True Qi is no weaker than Di Xiao’s. Good, very good!”</p>
<p>The cultivators around Xue Li were also paying close attention to this match now, unable to hide their shock.</p>
<p>Only An Ling’er wore an anxious look upon her face. Although Xue Li had just been praising Yang Kai, An Ling’er did not miss the coldness in this Demon General’s tone.</p>
<p>The more outstanding Yang Kai’s performance was, the more determined Xue Li would be to kill him!</p>
<p>However, if Yang Kai lost to Di Xiao, he would still die.</p>
<p>In either case, Yang Kai’s situation right now could only be described as perilous. An Ling’er thoughts were in chaos, not knowing what she should do.</p>
<p>“Interesting!” Di Xiao stared at Yang Kai as the latter continued to resist his attack.</p>
<p>Originally, when Gou Qiong sent him here to kill a little human brat, Di Xiao had thought it was a severe case of overkill and couldn’t work up any motivation. It was only after arriving in Sand City and hearing about Yang Kai’s various achievements that Di Xiao thought such a person was worthy of him executing.</p>
<p>However, that was all, he hadn’t really put Yang Kai in his eyes.</p>
<p>But now, after discovering that this human boy actually had enough strength to fight back against him, Di Xiao felt genuine excited.</p>
<p>Di Xiao was the kind of person who enjoyed fighting and was always eager to bathe in blood. On top of that, his favourite thing was to watch his opponent tenaciously resist yet ultimately fail and succ.u.mb to their demise.</p>
<p>At that moment, Di Xiao’s mentality underwent a subtle change and he began to regard Yang Kai as a real opponent.</p>
<p>The Demonic Qi which spewed out from Di Xiao’s body instantly increased a lot.</p>
<p>The tornados which were swirling around him like dark dragons also merged together and formed one giant ma.s.s, engulfing the entire Death Arena stage.</p>
<p>The surrounding barriers creaked under the impact of this wanton storm and ripples visible to the naked eye began to appear.</p>
<p>However, these barriers were all personally erected by Xue Li and obviously Di Xiao wouldn’t be able to destroy them so the Demon Race spectators in the stands weren’t worried, all of them still focusing all their attention on the match before them.</p>
<p>At this point, Yang Kai had been completely covered by wind blades and tornados.</p>
<p>The wind blade swept over him like a plague of locusts descending upon a field, overwhelming in number, their sharp auras constantly trying to tear him apart, the aura of death lingering about them.</p>
<p>There was nowhere to escape, and it was impossible to avoid them!</p>
<p>Yang Kai was cornered.</p>
<p><em>Kacha…</em></p>
<p>The s.h.i.+eld he had condensed from his Yang Liquid was unable to withstand this persistent bombardment and directly collapsed.</p>
<p>In the next moment, Yang Kai’s body was impacted by countless wind blades, his clothes shredded as blood splashed out. In less than a breath of time, Yang Kai’s skin was filled with innumerable wounds and his robes were broken and tattered.</p>
<p>Di Xiao grinned as he stared mercilessly at Yang Kai, as if he was looking at a dead man.</p>
<p>The next moment though, Di Xiao’s smile went stiff.</p>
<p>Yang Kai, who should have been killed, slowly straightened himself up while slightly lowering his head, staring back at Di Xiao with a gloomy and sinister expression, a burst of strange and creepy laughter leaked from his lips.</p>
<h2>With a sneer, Yang Kai stretched out a hand and pulled off his tattered s.h.i.+rt, revealing his toned physique and rippling muscles that seemed to contain a shocking amount of power.</h2>
<p>Standing in the center of the raging wind blades, Yang Kai remained unmoving, like a great mountain, resisting the surrounding storm without flinching in the slightest.</p>
<p>“Friend, it seems your strength isn’t much!”</p>
<p>An uproar spread throughout the crowd instantly when Yang Kai uttered these words.</p>
<p>The Demon Race spectators up in the stands were all shocked and amazed.</p>
<p>All of them had thought that this time, with Di Xiao personally taking action, Yang Kai would be swiftly defeated, even killed, but the situation in front of them differed greatly from their expectations, giving them a not small surprise.</p>
<p>Even wrapped completely in wind blades, Yang Kai’s body didn’t receive any noticeable damage, only suffering some minor cuts. It seemed his physique had reached an incredible degree of fort.i.tude, allowing him to withstand such attacks head on.</p>
<p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s provocation made Di Xiao’s expression become somewhat ugly, the latter smiling sullenly as he shot back, “You really don’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth! I must see how long you can keep spewing such nonsense!”</p>
<p>Saying so, Di Xiao waved his hands, and the swirling tornado that encompa.s.sed the entire Death Arena stage rapidly contracted, focusing all its destructive force on Yang Kai’s position, firmly trapping him in place.</p>
<p>As the tornado rapidly contracted, the number and intensity of the wind blades also greatly increased, forming a dark, dense killing zone around Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Like an angry black dragon, it slammed and whipped against Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Shaping True Qi is something I can do too!” Yang Kai grinned, and with a great roar, a huge dragon head appeared above his head.</p>
<p>A dazzling golden radiance cut through the dark wind, bringing with it a shocking and violent momentum.</p>
<p>A long body quickly formed behind the golden dragon head and in the next instant, it shot out, colliding with the dark tornado, the two ent.i.ties tearing and ripping into each other.</p>
<p>Over the entire Death Arena stage, a swirling storm of gold and black rampaged.</p>
<p>The golden dragon Yang Kai had just summoned was the very same one that was tattooed on his back. Before, Yang Kai was only able to use this hidden power when he was in his Devil Transformation state, but ever since his visit to Ice Sect, where he had blended souls with Su Yan, he discovered he could release it even in his normal state. On top of that, the golden dragon was also linked to Yang Kai’s Soul so it was far more agile and responsive than Di Xiao’s simple Martial Skill.</p>
<p>The two dragons fought one another, creating an incredible fierce display.</p>
<p>Everyone’s full attention was fixed on this magnificent scene, all of them staring up into the sky above the Death Arena stage, wondering which dragon would be the ultimate victor.</p>
<p><em>Hong Hong Hong…</em></p>
<p>With a series of deafening explosions, as if a volcano was erupting, the two dragons intertwined, and the dark tornado was gradually beaten back by the golden dragon, retreating in defeat over and over again, its colour quickly dimming.</p>
<p>True Yang Yuan Qi had always been the nemesis of Demonic Qi, so the aura the golden dragon radiated made every Demon Race cultivator present feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a pair of shouts resounded and the two figures who had been standing atop the Death Arena stage all this time flickered and collided, fresh blood splas.h.i.+ng out as they did.</p>
<p>At some point, when everyone’s eyes had been attracted to the two dragons colliding up in the sky, Yang Kai and Di Xiao had also begun engaging in a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Terrible bursts of energy filled the Death Arena stage. After the two figures separated from one another, Yang Kai wiped his hand across his chest, his fingers dripping with blood as he did.</p>
<p>Yang Kai felt an excruciating pain at that moment. Even though he had only clashed with Di Xiao for a few breaths, he felt like his body had been pierced by thousands of attacks, his chest and arms now bearing numerous bone deep wounds.</p>
<p>Gou Qiong’s high regard for Di Xiao was no misplaced. As a peak Third Order Transcendent, the latter indeed possessed battle sense and combat experience far beyond average, allowing him to capitalize on any opening presented before him.</p>
<p>However, although Yang Kai’s condition was miserable, Di Xiao’s wasn’t much better.</p>
<p>One of Di Xiao’s shoulders had been torn apart and a great chunk of his flesh was now missing, causing blood to flow down his side uncontrollably, his imposing aura also showed some signs of disorder as his face distorted from the pain.</p>
<p>Staring at one another, panting for breath, the eyes of the two fighters atop the Death Arena stage both turned red at the same time. At this moment, blood-thirst had consumed both Yang Kai and Di Xiao’s hearts, the only thought now being to fight and slaughter the opponent in front of them!</p>
<p>When she saw the blood flowing from Yang Kai’s abdomen, Xue Li, who had been lazily sitting the whole time, suddenly leapt to her feet, her beautiful eyes trembling as she stared towards the Death Arena stage, a look of disbelief covering her face, as if she had discovered something impossible.</p>
<p>“Mistress!” Yu Mo saw this and couldn’t help calling out.</p>
<p>Xue Li’s brow furrowed deeply as she took in a deep breath, relaxing her shocked expression and sitting down again only several breaths later.</p>
<p>Yu Mo wore a puzzled expression, not understanding why Xue Li had suddenly had such a violent reaction. Although Yang Kai’s performance was indeed far beyond everyone’s expectations, could that alone cause her to act so out of character?</p>
<p>[What did Mistress just discover?] Yu Mo thought about it for a while before slowly shaking his head and focusing his attention back on the battle down below.</p>
<p>Killing intent flowed out in great waves, and even from where he was standing high up in the stands, Yu Mo could clearly sense it, quickly steadying his mind lest he inadvertently be affected by it.</p>
<p>Di Xiao and Yang Kai were evenly matched, each of them matching the other blow for blow; no one could predict what the final outcome would be now.</p>
<p>The thick and powerful Demonic Qi that emerged from Di Xiao’s body created a dark domain around him filled with evil energy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yang Kai was like a small burning sun, his True Yang Yuan Qi surging towards his surroundings, blocking the attacks of Di Xiao’s Demonic Qi. The two opposite energies collided with one another violently, each one trying to annihilate the other.</p>
<p>Both fighters pushed their strength to the extreme, neither of them daring to hold back or show mercy.</p>
<p>Great howls and deafening roars filled the air.</p>
<p>A shocking murderous intent pulsed from Yang Kai who now could only think of killing, shouting towards the Heavens, forgetting everything else, his only desire now was to destroy the enemy before him.</p>
<p>True Yang Yuan Qi madly surged forth and suddenly suppressed the other party’s Demonic Qi.</p>
<p>Di Xiao’s expression tightened and he didn’t dare hesitate, his body flickering and instantly appearing above Yang Kai as he sent out a devastating palm strike filled with deadly aura towards the masked human youth below.</p>
<p>The surrounding ground instantly disintegrated and transformed into fine dust, but Yang Kai managed to avoid this strike at the last moment and counterattack, sending out his own palm strike filled with dense True Yang Yuan Qi towards Di Xiao.</p>
<p>Without the slightest reservation, the two fighters atop the Death Arena stage used all their skill and strength to clash with one another.</p>
<p>Di Xiao’s cultivation was higher than Yang Kai’s by two Minor Realms, but his Demonic Qi was being suppressed by Yang Kai’s True Yang Yuan Qi so he could only bring out about eighty percent of his maximum strength, causing him to feel extremely annoyed and frustrated.</p>
<p>As the contest between Yang Kai and Di Xiao become more and more intense, the surrounding World Energy became increasingly turbulent, shrouding their figures and obscuring their auras.</p>
<p>The spectators up in the stands now could only see vague figures flickering about and were unable to determine the exact situation atop the stage.</p>
<p>This was a true death match!</p>
<p>Blood constantly spattered onto the cracked ground as deafening explosions continuously rang out. Both Yang Kai and Di Xiao had been consumed by madness and had lost track of everything else around them. This kind of fierce battle caused everyone who witnessed it to tremble from excitement and fear.</p>
<p>A variety of exquisite Demon Race Martial Skills were released from Di Xiao’s hands, each one causing Yang Kai to suffer greatly. In response, Yang Kai used the flexibility and potency of his Yang Liquid to rip apart and penetrate Di Xiao’s defences.</p>
<p>The two figures entangled and violently bombarded one another, each attack carrying with it a ruthless killing intent. As they fought, flashes of light constantly burst out and as the area around them seemed to explode as if it was being engulfed in a meteor shower, dazzling the spectating crowds.</p>
<p>Before anyone knew it, half of the Death Arena stage had been destroyed.</p>
<p>There had never been a battle which caused such destruction to the Death Arena before. Every Demon Race spectator felt his or her blood boil, many of them wis.h.i.+ng they could throw all caution to the wind, jump down from the stands, and join this b.l.o.o.d.y fight to the death.</p>
<p>Di Xiao became more and more shocked as the battle dragged on. Never had he dreamed that a human boy whose cultivation was far lower than his own could actually possess such strength.</p>
<p>His own killings strikes continuously rained down on Yang Kai but often could only superficially wound the latter, never once delivering the intended fatal blow; his opponent’s body was like a lump of steel, completely unlike the fragile humans he had fought before.</p>
<p>However, what shocked Di Xiao the most was Yang Kai’s resiliency and endurance.</p>
<p>Each and every move the two of them made contained the maximum amount of force possible, neither of them holding anything back, so after such a long fight Di Xiao was very fl.u.s.tered and had consumed a ma.s.sive amount of his Demonic Qi, causing both his momentum and strength to fall far below his peak.</p>
<p>But this Human boy was different, he had somehow managed to maintain the same level of output this entire time, never once weakening, even becoming somewhat more intense as time pa.s.sed.</p>
<p>It was like his body contained an inexhaustible supply of True Qi!</p>
<p>In addition, the more Yang Kai was wounded, the more brutally he fought back, as if the pain was a drug stimulating his bloodthirsty nature.</p>
<p>As the battle dragged on, Di Xiao noticed something which truly made him afraid.</p>
<p>The wounds Yang Kai had suffered throughout their fight were actually healing at a speed visible to the naked eye; for instance, the dense injuries he had previously received from the opening salvo of wind blades had now basically disappeared.</p>
<p>[This kid can even restore his own injuries in the middle of a fight?]</p>
<p>Di Xiao hadn’t seen Yang Kai take any kind of pill or elixir; moreover, there was no time for him to have done so.</p>
<p>For the first time, Di Xiao discovered that such a strange person actually existed, not only could he compete with the so called favoured Sons of Heaven, he actually far exceeded them.</p>
<p>This discovery struck a deep blow to Di Xiao’s pride, causing his mood to become somewhat gloomy.</p>
<p>He was an elite amongst the elite of the Demon Race. At just eighty years old, he had already reached the very peak of the Third Order Transcendent Realm and was expected to break through to the Saint Realm before the age of one hundred!</p>
<p>A one hundred year old Saint Realm was a rare presence throughout the entire realm.</p>
<p>Some of the great forces of the Tong Xuan Realm managed to raise their own elite disciples to the Transcendent Realm at very young ages, but once they reached that realm, almost all of them would experience a sharp decrease in their rate of growth and fewer still managed to become Saints before the age of one hundred.</p>
<p>But he, Di Xiao, had such potential! Gou Qiong had high expectations for him and gave him the best cultivation environments and resources to support his growth.</p>
<p>Di Xiao has always been proud of this and felt that one day he could certainly become the first person below the Demon Commander, or possibly even the Demon Commander himself!</p>
<p>But now, he had received a devastating blow. If what Gou Che had reported was the truth, then this human boy who was even now fighting evenly with him was only twenty-five or six years old.</p>
<p>Could it be that he had been cultivating for so many decades in vain?</p>
<h2>When masters fought, it was not only a contest of their skills but also a battle of their wills.</h2>
<p>As soon as Di Xiao’s state of mind became disturbed, the stalemate was broken and his momentum collapsed, allowing Yang Kai to completely suppress him.</p>
<p>The Demon Race spectators up in the stands also quickly discovered that the situation had taken a turn for the worse. Originally, the gold and black auras in the Death Arena stage were equal in intensity to one another, but suddenly the dark Demonic Qi belonging to Di Xiao weakened while the annoying golden aura shone brilliantly.</p>
<p>Seeing this scene, everyone couldn’t sit still.</p>
<p>“Impossible! Can this boy even defeat Di Xiao?”</p>
<p>“How can this be? Di Xiao is a Third Order Transcendent, two full levels higher than him.”</p>
<p>“If Di Xiao is defeated, my Demon Race will lose all face!”</p>
<p>“Is… is that guy really real? A First Order Transcendent being able to defeat a Third Order, if he were to becomes a Saint…”</p>
<p>Even Feng Biao, who had been sent by Gou Qiong to oversee this task, had a gloomy look upon his face as his brow furrowed deeply, his hands crus.h.i.+ng the arms of his chair unconsciously.</p>
<p>Xue Li was also leaning forward now, her powerful Divine Sense penetrating the Death Arena’s barriers as she carefully observed the changes in the battle.</p>
<p>No one in the audience had a clearer idea of what was happening than her because she was the one who had constructed the barriers around the Death Arena stage in the first place. Her original intention was to make it so that the cultivators who fought would not receive any interference from the gamblers on the outside, so even if they were top-level masters, if they tried to peep through these barriers, all they’d be able to discover was some vague details.</p>
<p>Xue Li was different though, her beautiful eyes easily able to track Yang Kai and Di Xiao’s movements.</p>
<p>The battle turning out like this was truly beyond Xue Li’s expectations, even if she managed to glean some clues from An Ling’er’s behaviour, inferring the possibility that Yang Kai might win, it was still difficult to believe what she was seeing.</p>
<p>This fight was also far more exciting than she antic.i.p.ated!</p>
<p>Also, as Xue Li spectated the match, the murderous intent that originally filled her eyes slowly faded and was instead replaced with a thick sense of confusion.</p>
<p>With a thunderous explosion, the gold and black energies which had been entangled with each other this whole time suddenly separated and two silhouettes retreated backwards, coming to a stop a dozen meters or so apart.</p>
<p>Dust blew about and the battlefield lay in ruins, everyone up in the stands held their breath, the entire Death Arena falling silent as all eyes stared towards the stage down below, wondering who had come out on top.</p>
<p>Gradually, the dust settled and the two fighters’ figures appeared before everyone’s eyes.</p>
<p>Sharp breaths were drawn as the Demon Race spectators couldn’t believe what they were seeing.</p>
<p>Di Xiao was bathed in blood, with almost no part of his body still intact. All over his scarred skin there were clearly visible palm print, fist marks, etc…</p>
<p>Gou Qiong’s elite subordinate seemed to be exhausted, his laboured breathing clearly ringing in everyone’s ears, ill.u.s.trating just how weak he currently was.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was also covered in blood that, under the strong rays of the sun, seemed to glow a faint golden colour, giving him a strange appearance. There were many scars and wounds all over his strong body, numbering no less than the ones on Di Xiao’s.</p>
<p>The only difference between the two was the look in their eyes; Di Xiao’s originally confident gaze was now dull while Yang Kai’s was filled with strength.</p>
<p>Di Xiao had been defeated!</p>
<p>As long as one wasn’t blind, they would be able to see this.</p>
<p>“I’ve underestimated you… you’re truly strong!” Di Xiao coughed a few times, spitting out some blood and viscera from his mouth.</p>
<p>“Anyone who looks down on me has to pay the price!” Yang Kai grinned and took a deep breath before lifting his foot and slowly walking forward, his True Qi surging once more, his eyes filling with murderous intent.</p>
<p>It was clear he planned to kill the person in front of him and bring this deathmatch to a close!</p>
<p>Seeing his intentions, Feng Biao, who had been in something of a daze in the stands, came to his senses and stood up, shouting in an angered voice, “Little brat, you dare!”</p>
<p>As he shouted, his figure flickered, disappearing from where he stood and shooting towards the Death Arena stage like a bolt of lightning.</p>
<p>Despite Di Xiao disappointing Sir Gou Qiong’s expectations, actually losing to a little human brat, he was still one of Gou Qiong’s most elite warriors. Yang Kai couldn’t be allowed to simply kill him here.</p>
<p>Feng Biao couldn’t just sit idly by and watch, he had to take this opportunity to finish off Yang Kai!</p>
<p>“Yu Mo!” On the other side of the arena, Xue Li suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>Yu Mo nodded lightly and also shot out.</p>
<p>A moment later, Yu Mo appeared in front of Feng Biao, blocking his way.</p>
<p>“Make way!” Feng Biao shouted furiously, not having any scruples about this being Xue Li’s site, sending out a palm towards Yu Mo as the latter responded in kind.</p>
<p>The two First Order Saints instantly engaged in an astonis.h.i.+ng fight over the Death Arena, each move they made shaking the Heavens, causing the hearts of all the spectators down below to clench.</p>
<p>All the Demon Race spectators present were dumbfounded. They hadn’t expected to see such a wonderful battle between peak Transcendent Realm cultivators today and now they were even being shown a rare fight between Saint Realm masters. This unexpected development immediately invigorated them, drawing their full attention.</p>
<p>“Yu Mo, what’s the meaning of this?!” Feng Biao couldn’t get rid of Yu Mo’s entanglement and immediately interrogated him, “You know who Di Xiao is. If he dies here, can you withstand Sir Gou Qiong’s anger?”</p>
<p>“Idiot! Whether Gou Qiong is angry or not has nothing to do with me!” Yu Mo sneered, “This is Sand City, my Mistress’ site, or did you forget even something so basic?”</p>
<p>“Are you trying to force Sir Gou Qiong and Xue Li into a war!”</p>
<p>“I have no such intent; however, the Death Arena has the rules of the Death Arena. Two people enter, only one may leave alive, this rule may not be broken!”</p>
<p>“You…” Feng Biao ground his teeth as he continued the fight with Yu Mo. Still managing to focus on the ground, Feng Biao saw Yang Kai arrive in front of Di Xiao and condensed his True Yang Yuan Qi into his fingertip and calmly pointed it towards the limp, Di Xiao.</p>
<p>Di Xiao was thoroughly exhausted and didn’t even have the strength to stand properly much less put up any kind of resistance. At this moment, he was simply looking to the sky helplessly.</p>
<p>Feng Biao quickly shouted, “Little brat, if you dare do this, you’re dead!”</p>
<p>Just as he said these words though, the True Qi gathered at Yang Kai’s fingertips transformed into a sharp blade and stabbed into Di Xiao’s chest.</p>
<p>Di Xiao’s body shook, and the blood gushed from his chest like a fountain, his eyes opening wide as he fell backwards.</p>
<p><em>Peng…</em></p>
<p>A puff of dust flew up.</p>
<p>“That little brat…”</p>
<p>“He really killed Di Xiao.”</p>
<p>“Interesting! I don’t think even Miss Xue Li can protect him now!”</p>
<p>“If Miss Xue Li doesn’t protect him, he’ll definitely die!”</p>
<p>In midair, seeing with their own eyes that Di Xiao had died, Feng Biao and Yu Mo also stopped fighting, the former’s face becoming extremely gloomy, his eyes staring hatefully towards Yang Kai, seemingly want to tear off the latter’s stupid mask to see just what kind of b.a.s.t.a.r.d was beneath it.</p>
<p>Yu Mo’s eyes also flashed as he was secretly shocked by Yang Kai’s boldness, quickly returning to Xue Li’s side without saying a word.</p>
<p>Next to Di Xiao’s body, Yang Kai stood quietly, his back straight and motionless.</p>
<p>Under the influence of the Demon Eye of Annihilation, an undetectable Soul remnant poured into Yang Kai’s mind and was absorbed.</p>
<p>Gradually, the atmosphere and aura in the surroundings became strange and the fluctuations pulsing from Yang Kai’s body underwent a subtle change.</p>
<p>The deep rage and hatred in Feng Bao’s eyes which were staring at Yang Kai were suddenly replaced with a thick shock and jealousy.</p>
<p>“Mistress…” Yu Mo also exclaimed, his eyes narrowing as he stared towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Xue Li’s complexion also changed again upon feeling the energy fluctuations coming from Yang Kai, a look of genuine surprise filling her face.</p>
<p>“Mistress, could it be…” Yu Mo’s voice trembled as he hesitantly spoke.</p>
<p>“En, it’s an epiphany, this boy…” Xue Li’s beautiful eyes flashed a strange brilliance, “A few months fighting life or death battles here have probably allowed him to comprehend many things and today’s battle allowed all of that to sublimate, resulting in sudden enlightenment.”</p>
<p>“Inconceivable!” Yu Mo cried out in amazement, “Does he want to break through here? Isn’t he acting a bit too supercilious?”</p>
<p>Di Xiao had just been killed by him and Feng Biao couldn’t wait to put him to death, the Demon Race spectators in the stand also were filled with indignation and many were clamouring for Yang Kai’s life. This was quite likely the worst possible time for a breakthrough.</p>
<p>If the situation wasn’t handled well, it might turn into a riot where the angry crowd directly swarmed him.</p>
<p>“Mistress, in this situation, do we just sit back and watch?” Yu Mo turned to Xue Li and asked.</p>
<p>As long as Xue Li didn’t speak, Yang Kai would definitely die today, no Demon Race cultivator wanted to let such a monstrous human boy continue breathing. Although Yang Kai had brought them a lot of excitement and entertainment, the situation was different now.</p>
<p>Everyone here was no well aware of how terrifying this boy’s potential was!</p>
<p>“Nonsense, of course we’re not going to just sit back and watch. Relay my command, anyone who dares to enter the Death Arena stage before he finished breaking through is to be killed without mercy!” Xue Li’s beautiful face filled with an inexplicable excitement.</p>
<p>“…ah?” Yu Mo let out a gaff; dumbfounded by the order he had just been given.</p>
<p>Just before, Xue Li had clearly decided to kill Yang Kai today regardless of whether he won or lost the fight, so this sudden and drastic change in att.i.tude greatly confused Yu Mo.</p>
<p>If they really wanted to kill this human brat, they didn’t even need to act. Feng Biao and the other Demon Race spectators would happily murder Yang Kai while he was breaking through.</p>
<p>Earlier, Yu Mo had only blocked Feng Biao to suppress Gou Qiong and maintain the rules of the Death Arena.</p>
<p>Was this little brat’s performance so impressive that Xue Li was reluctant to kill him? Yu Mo secretly speculated but still couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t ask anything and simply carried out his orders, spreading out his Divine Sense in the next instant to relay Xue Li’s command.</p>
<p>The next moment, from outside the Death Arena, a large number of powerful Demon Race masters appeared, taking up defensive positions around the broken stage.</p>
<p>Seeing this scene, everyone understood that Xue Li intended to shelter Yang Kai and immediately dismissed all thoughts attacking, contenting themselves to just holler and scream angrily.</p>
<p>Yang Kai, standing atop the Death Arena’s stage, seemed completely unaware of all this.</p>
<p>But, in truth, he was also paying close attention to his surroundings, so the behaviour of Xue Li’s subordinates also caused him to feel a bit confused. However, since this woman didn’t seem to want to immediately kill him, Yang Kai focused his attention back onto breaking through safely, clearing his mind of all distractions and entering a state of enlightenment.</p>
<h2>Outside the Death Arena stage, countless Demon Race spectators shouted and cursed but none of them dared to make any rash moves.</h2>
<p>Atop the stage, the surrounding World Energy churned violently.</p>
<p>After what seemed like a long time had pa.s.sed, a burst of energy that cracked the surrounding earth suddenly burst out with Yang Kai at its center.</p>
<p>All of the World Energy in the area began madly swirling about as if it were being drawn in by a giant whirlpool, cras.h.i.+ng against the Death Arena stage’s barriers.</p>
<p>“Such terrifying World Energy!” Yu Mo’s eyes went round as he couldn’t help calling out in shock.</p>
<p>Xue Li also had showed a look of surprise, her beautiful eyes flas.h.i.+ng a strange light as she muttered under her breath, “He really has enough capital to act so crazily, this kind of World Energy baptism is comparable to something a Third Order Transcendent Realm Master would face. No wonder he was able to kill Di Xiao.”</p>
<p>The spectating Demon Race cultivators who saw this scene also didn’t have pleasant looks upon their faces. If the one currently standing on the Death Arena stage was Di Xiao, they would be cheering joyously, but a human boy showing such potential only made them feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>As a tidal wave of World Energy flowed towards the Death Arena stage, Yang Kai closed his eyes, his face filled with a look of comfort as the faint golden glow shrouding him became more and more dazzling.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the violent storm of World Energy rushed towards Yang Kai’s body and within ten breaths was completely absorbed by him.</p>
<p>The chaotic aura within the Death Arena also became tranquil.</p>
<p>Staring at Yang Kai now, the expressions of the surrounding Demon Race masters were unsightly as they grumbled in their hearts but were unable to vocalize just how they were feeling at the moment.</p>
<p>Yang Kai, who had been severely wounded in his battle with Di Xiao, was now recovering at an astonis.h.i.+ng speed, the minor injuries he had suffered already completely healed while the major ones were no longer a hindrance to his movement.</p>
<p>Xue Li beautiful eyes shrank upon seeing this and she licked her thin red lips as she stared excitedly towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Atop the Death Arena stage, Yang Kai gently clenched his fists and felt the power flowing through his body, extremely satisfied.</p>
<p>This time’s breakthrough had gone incredibly smoothly.</p>
<p>The insights and sentiments he had gained over the past few months of difficult fights had been like nourishment for his body and Soul, allowing him to reach the edge of a breakthrough, and after a fierce battle with Di Xiao, he managed to spy on the mysteries of the Second Order Transcendent Realm.</p>
<p>The purity and density of Yang Kai’s True Qi had risen to a new level, and even his Spiritual Energy had sublimated, becoming more powerful than before.</p>
<p>Yang Kai couldn’t have been more pleased with this outcome. The only thing that made him feel helpless was that he was still standing in the middle of the Death Arena, surrounded by Demon Race masters.</p>
<p>What’s more, Xue Li was looking on!</p>
<p>The killing intent Xue Li had towards him had not gone unnoticed by Yang Kai, so he never dropped his guard against her, but with the huge gap in their strength, he still couldn’t help feeling powerless.</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai didn’t understand why she suddenly decided to protect him and allow him to break through here, he knew this woman didn’t do so out of kindness. His best option was still to leave Sand City as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Considering all this, Yang Kai turned his eyes towards Xue Li and shouted, “Senior Xue Li, are the words you spoke to me before still valid?”</p>
<p>Xue Li’s beautiful eyes narrowed as she laughed charmingly, “What words are you referring to?”</p>
<p>“You promised me that as long as I can win in this battle, you will let me and my companion leave! It can’t be that Senior Xue Li doesn’t intend to keep her word?” Yang Kai continued to shout, making sure his voice could be heard by all the surrounding Demon Race spectators.</p>
<p>Xue Li let out a light snort as she stared at Yang Kai from far away, a trace of hatred flas.h.i.+ng across her beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>Although the two of them indeed had such an agreement, Xue Li never had any intention of complying with it, but now that Yang Kai had exposed it in front of so many people, Xue Li would have to consider it again.</p>
<p>A Demon General failing to keep their word would greatly harm Xue Li’s reputation.</p>
<p>“Smelly brat!” Xue Li ground her teeth angrily, fully realizing Yang Kai was doing this to force her hand knowing she couldn’t refuse him in the presence of so many witnesses.</p>
<p>“Mistress, he’s seeking his own death!” Yu Mo said, taking pleasure in Yang Kai’s misfortune as he grinned, “Just let him leave, then he’ll die without us having to lift a finger!”</p>
<p>As he said so, Yu Mo glanced over at Feng Biao who was even now exuding a thick murderous intent. Yu Mo knew that Feng Biao was the one who most wanted to put Yang Kai to death.</p>
<p>“The key is that I don’t want him to die now!” Xue Li grumbled.</p>
<p>Yu Mo was stunned and didn’t dare say anything more.</p>
<p>“Does Senior Xue Li want to renege on her promise?” Atop the Death Arena stage, Yang Kai shouted for the third time, his face was filled with an unreadable smile.</p>
<p>Xue Li let out a soft breath, causing her proud peaks to undulate exaggeratedly; slowly getting up, she said to Yang Kai in a calm voice, “Naturally this King will not, you and your female companion are free to leave. Wherever you decide to go now, you may go, no one here will try to stop you!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai stared at her deeply, cupped his fists and bowed lightly, “Many thanks, Senior Xue Li!”</p>
<p>Saying so, Yang Kai soared up from the Death Arena stage, arriving beside Xue Li in the blink of an eye, grabbed hold of An Ling’er, and shouted, “Let’s go!”</p>
<p>“Little brat, I believe we will meet again soon!” Xue Li suddenly whispered, the words directly reaching Yang Kai’s ear, causing his heart to tremble. Sweeping his eyes towards Xue Li, Yang Kai suddenly discovered that this vicious woman was staring at him profoundly.</p>
<p>[Cheap wh.o.r.e!] Yang Kai secretly cursed, realizing that Xue Li had no intention of letting him go so easily. In front of all these Demon Race spectators sitting around the Death Arena, going back on her word would make her lose too much face so she had no choice but to agree to his demands for now, but she was no doubt planning to make a move behind the scenes.</p>
<p>As soon as Yang Kai and An Ling’er left, he estimated multiple pursuers would follow!</p>
<p>Even so, Yang Kai simply smiled confidently and replied, “Really? I believe we’ll never see one another again!”</p>
<p>“We’ll see!” Xue Li coldly snorted.</p>
<p>Yang Kai brought An Ling’er up into the sky and soared off towards the horizon like a bolt of lightning.</p>
<p>From the Death Arena’s stand, those who were particularly angry and wished to kill Yang Kai also got up and left in groups of three or four, quickly following after the latter.</p>
<p>Xue Li and Yu Mo both ignored this, pretending they saw nothing, making no attempt to block these people.</p>
<p>Feng Biao, who was Gou Qiong’s representative, stood in place, his face showing a contemplatively look for a moment before turning his gaze to Xue Li, grinning meaningfully, and also flying off.</p>
<p>“Mistress, if all of them really pursue that little brat, he may really end up dead!” Yu Mo whispered.</p>
<p>Not to mention the First Order Saint Feng Biao who as pursing him, just the gathering of Demon Race masters who had left to chase Yang Kai were enough to kill him.</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai’s combat ability was out of the ordinary and he had just broken through a Minor Realm, he had just fought an intense battle with Di Xiao so it was likely he wouldn’t be able to exert anywhere near his peak strength.</p>
<p>After the ones pursuing him caught up, the only possible result was his death!</p>
<p>“En, he’s dead!” Xue Li grit her teeth, obviously somewhat annoyed, “That little brat brought this upon himself. If he obediently stayed here I wouldn’t have killed him, but he just had to go seeking death all on his own.”</p>
<p>“Then…”</p>
<p>“Go bring him back!” Xue Li ordered, “Don’t let anyone else capture or kill him.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Yu Mo bowed before chasing after Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Hmph, actually daring to say we’ll never see one another again? I’d very much like to see what kind of expression you show this King when we next meet!” Xue Li smiled lightly, got up, and strolled casually towards her palace to await the moment Yang Kai was captured.</p>
<p>Outside of Sand City, Yang Kai flew while tightly holding An Ling’er, his speed pushed to his current limit, the two of them leaving a long afterimage behind them.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?” An Ling’er asked, full of concern, she had seen just how seriously injured Yang Kai was just now in his battle against Di Xiao. Right now what he needed most was rest but instead he had to madly consume his True Qi.</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” Yang Kai shook his head.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was clearer about his condition than anyone so he couldn’t help marveling at the astonis.h.i.+ng restorative power of his Demon G.o.d Blood. Normally, after suffering such heavy injuries, Yang Kai would have to cultivate for several days in order to recover, but now, the Demon G.o.d Blood in his body was actually mending his wounds at a rate visible to the naked eye, so although he wasn’t perfectly healed, flying and even fighting wouldn’t be an issue.</p>
<p>On top of that, the thing Yang Kai least had to worry about was his consumption of True Qi; with hundreds of drops of Yang Liquid in his Dantian and more than sixty Divine Tree fruits in his Black Book s.p.a.ce, his reserve of True Qi was essentially unlimited.</p>
<p>“It seems like someone is chasing us!” An Ling’er suddenly whispered, her beautiful face paling.</p>
<p>“Not one, many!” Yang Kai’s expression remained unchanged. With his unusually powerful Divine Sense, he had long ago noticed they were being pursued and even knew the exact number and cultivation of the ones chasing them.</p>
<p>There was quite a large number of Transcendents accompanied by two or three Saints in the lead group.</p>
<p>Behind these people was Feng Biao who had firmly locked his Divine Sense onto him like maggots on rotting bones.</p>
<p>Still further behind Feng Biao was Yu Mo!</p>
<p>Xue Li really had sent him to chase after them, causing Yang Kai to curse in his heart, swearing one day he would teach that viper woman a good lesson.</p>
<p>All in all, more than half of the masters from Sand City were now pursuing Yang Kai and An Ling’er.</p>
<p>Although bitter in his heart, Yang Kai revealed nothing on his face and simply continued flying forward at his current speed.</p>
<p>The Demon Race masters who chased after them from Sand City had all summoned their own artifacts and were doing their best to quickly shorten the distance between themselves and Yang Kai.</p>
<p>After half an hour, Yang Kai had flown several hundred kilometers but his pursuers were now closing in.</p>
<p>Noticing this, An Ling’er became anxious and hurriedly used her Secret Art to help promote the circulation speed of Yang Kai’s True Qi.</p>
<p>“They can’t catch us,” Yang Kai comforted her gently while continuing to maintain his flight speed, waiting for the right opportunity.</p>
<p>From what Yang Kai could perceive, most of his pursuers were not worth being worried about. As soon as he released his Soul Devouring Insects, the vast majority of them would die.</p>
<p>The only ones Yang Kai needed to pay attention to were the Saint Realm masters and Feng Biao and Yu Mo behind them, these masters were still difficult opponents for him to face!</p>
<p>However, noticing that Feng Biao and Yu Mo were maintaining a certain distance from him and not approaching any closer, seemingly staying at the limit of where their Divine Senses could track him, Yang Kai immediately felt like his chance had come!</p>
<h2>Whether it was Feng Biao or Yu Mo, both of them obviously had great confidence in their own strength and were unwilling to work together with other Demon Race cultivators, so they consciously maintained some distance between themselves, the other pursuers, and Yang Kai.</h2>
<p>This however gave Yang Kai an opportunity.</p>
<p>With a whoosh, Wind and Thunder Qi surged up and Yang Kai’s Wind and Thunder Wings unfurled from his back.</p>
<p>With a flicker of these wings, Yang Kai’s already quick pace suddenly multiplied several times over. Meanwhile, An Ling’er narrowed her eyes and circulated her True Qi in order to resist the violent surge in wind pressure around her.</p>
<p>In an instant, the pair left Feng Biao and Yu Mo’s Divine Sense’s coverage range.</p>
<p>An Ling’er couldn’t help letting out a shout; although this wasn’t the first time she had seen Yang Kai use his Wind and Thunder Wings, having already witnessed them back when they were fleeing from Saintess Nan, no matter how many times she saw them, should couldn’t help feeling fascinated by their beauty.</p>
<p>Such a pair of wings should not be owned by a man, but instead by a woman.</p>
<p>Even so, seeing Yang Kai like this, An Ling’er felt he seemed quite heroic at the moment.</p>
<p>An Ling’er pursed her lips slightly as she stared at Yang Kai’s profile, her eyes blurring slightly, unconsciously pressing her tender body closer to his as she tightly held onto him with her arms.</p>
<p>“Hey, why are you going starry eyed in this kind of situation?” Yang Kai immediately noticed An Ling’er’s abnormal behaviour and turned a dumbfounded gaze towards her as an amazingly soft and elastic sensation made contact with his arm, causing his fierce momentum and tension to rapidly deflate.</p>
<p>An Ling’er’s face suddenly flushed bright red and immediately shot back indignantly, “What nonsense are you talking about? I… I just thought that the outside world is truly filled with wonder, completely different from what I imagined it would be like back in the Holy Land.”</p>
<p>Since her first encounter with Yang Kai, An Ling’er’s days had truly been filled with excitement. All this stimulation frightened her and caused her much grief, but it was also incredibly thrilling; it was as if, so long as she stayed together with Yang Kai, no matter what kind of danger they encountered, they would be able to safely pa.s.s through it.</p>
<p>“An average person can’t have such an exciting life!” Yang Kai laughed somewhat dumbly, waving his wings rhythmically, pus.h.i.+ng his speed faster and faster, transforming into a streak of light that shot across the sky.</p>
<p>The expressions of the Demon Race masters who had been tailing the pair all abruptly changed when this occurred. All of them were closing in on Yang Kai, but in the blink of an eye, they had actually completely lost track of him.</p>
<p>Amongst the group of pursuers, even three Saint Realm masters couldn’t hide their shock. Not daring to hold back any longer, they quickly pushed their speed to its maximum and shot off in the direction Yang Kai fled.</p>
<p>A moment later, two figures flew over and joined the pursuit. Obviously these two were Feng Biao and Yu Mo who noticed something had gone wrong and thus increased their pace.</p>
<p>The expressions of the two Saints were particularly awful, especially Yu Mo’s. It wasn’t until now that he realized that even in that brutal life or death battle with Di Xiao, Yang Kai had still been hiding his strength.</p>
<p>With the astonis.h.i.+ng speed Yang Kai just displayed, it would have been easy for him to have Di Xiao dancing in the palm of his hand, but he had actually concealed it until just now; obviously he had done so in order to get his pursuers to lower their guard, giving him a chance to escape.</p>
<p>As a result, Yang Kai really managed to escape from his pursuers’ Divine Sense search range.</p>
<p>“That d.a.m.n brat!” Yu Mo’s face twisted in anger as he cursed while continuing to chase after Yang Kai.</p>
<p>An hour later, the Transcendent Realm Demon Race masters who had been pursuing Yang Kai finally came to a stop. They had no idea which direction Yang Kai and the few Saint Realm masters had gone or any way to track them, so after letting out a few bitter sighs and curses, they turned around and headed back to Sand City.</p>
<p>Three thousand kilometers from Sand City, Yang Kai’s expression became gloomy.</p>
<p>He found that he had still underestimated the means of these Saint Realm masters. Although Yang Kai had already used his Wind and Thunder Wings to flee from the range of their Divine Senses, he could clearly tell that, using some unknown method, they were still actually chasing after him.</p>
<p>The Demon Land was vast, and Yang Kai wasn’t even sure where he was, so he could only chose to flee in a random direction and pray that he eventually left this place.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s powerful Spiritual Energy played a vital role at this time; although his True Qi cultivation was only at the Second Order Transcendent Realm, his Spiritual Energy was no weaker than a Saint Realm master’s.</p>
<p>His Divine Sense’s strength was actually even greater than Feng Biao and Yu Mo’s, allowing him to grasp their location even when they couldn’t grasp his.</p>
<p>With this advantage to aid him, Yang Kai somehow managed to avoid populated regions and being discovered by other Demon Race masters, saving him a lot of unnecessary trouble.</p>
<p>After fleeing for a long time though, even Yang Kai began to feel fatigued. Whether it was physically or mentally, he had consumed a great deal of stamina, even An Ling’er’s face was dispirited, obviously tired out.</p>
<p>Repeatedly escaping and hiding, the pair still couldn’t get rid of Feng Biao and Yu Mo’s pursuit. The other Saint Realm masters had given up after chasing Yang Kai for a few days, but these two were like rabid dogs, swearing not to rest until they sank their teeth into their prey.</p>
<p>Feng Biao and Yu Mo, who both found the other unpleasing to the eye, even formed a kind of subtle camaraderie born of mutual hatred during this seemingly never ending chase.</p>
<p>Time flew by and soon half a month had pa.s.sed, then one month…</p>
<p>Carrying An Ling’er with him, Yang Kai had now crossed hundreds of thousands of kilometers of the Demon Land. The only upside was that the Demonic Qi which constantly lingered in the air seemed to be getting thinner, causing Yang Kai to secretly rejoice, feeling like he had not chosen the wrong direction and that so long as he kept this up, they would soon be able to leave the Demon Land.</p>
<p>As long as they left the Demon Land, Feng Biao and Yu Mo would likely stop pursuing them.</p>
<p>With a renewed sense of hope, Yang Kai suddenly became full of energy.</p>
<p>One day though, as Yang Kai was soaring forward, his expression suddenly became solemn and he quickly came to a halt, staring fixedly at a patch of jungle in front of him.</p>
<p>From the direction he was staring, Yang Kai noticed the aura of a large number of masters seemingly concealing themselves while waiting in ambush.</p>
<p>When Yang Kai came to a stop, from the jungle below, a pair of cold eyes fixed onto him.</p>
<p>“Such a vigilant brat!” The Demon Race said in praise as a look of surprise flas.h.i.+ng across his face. He and the people he had brought with him had perfectly concealed their auras and hidden themselves amongst the environment, but had unexpectedly still been discovered by their target.</p>
<p>“Still trying to act stealthy at this point? Just show yourselves!” Yang Kai observed for a moment before suddenly calling out.</p>
<p>The leader of this group of Demon Race masters grinned and no longer tried to conceal himself, soaring up into the air to face Yang Kai directly.</p>
<p>Observing this Demon Race master, Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling somewhat suspicious. He had never met, or even seen this man before, but from the other side’s att.i.tude, it was obvious he was waiting here for him and An Ling’er.</p>
<p>This person’s cultivation was also not weak, probably a Saint Realm master, and even if he wasn’t as strong as Feng Biao or Yu Mo, he wasn’t much worse. Behind this man, there were also a number of powerful masters who seemed to be curiously eyeing Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Hearing a rus.h.i.+ng sound coming from behind him, Yang Kai’s face sank, realizing that Feng Biao and Yu Mo were quickly approaching.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a moment later, these two made dogs appeared and stopped close behind Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Yu Mo, this is the human brat you said escaped from Sand City?” The Demon Race master in front stared at Yang Kai and casually asked.</p>
<p>With an ice cold expression, Yu Mo nodded and said, “Yeah!” Then turning to Yang Kai and cursing, “d.a.m.n brat, you really run fast! If I didn’t send word to City Lord Man to block your path, I’m afraid I really wouldn’t have been able to stop you!”</p>
<p>As he spoke, a look of deep hatred flashed across his eyes.</p>
<p>After receiving Xue Li’s orders, Yu Mo thought he would quickly be able to capture Yang Kai and return to Sand City, but after an entire month of pursuing the latter, not only was Yu Mo thoroughly exhausted, he had nearly failed his mission.</p>
<p>Right now, Yu Mo was feeling quite aggrieved and depressed, secretly swearing to himself to brutally torment Yang Kai the whole way back to Sand City after capturing him in order to vent the hatred in his heart.</p>
<p>After listening to Yu Mo, Yang Kai suddenly understood that, while chasing him, the other party had used some method to convey a message to this City Lord Man, telling the latter to set up an ambush here.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled bitterly. In the end, this was someone else’s territory. Although he had managed to escape for a while, he was finally blocked today. This was no doubt a hopeless situation.</p>
<p>As Yu Mo and City Lord Man were conversing, Feng Biao simply stood to the side, his eyes drifting back and forth, seemingly observing the situation.</p>
<p>He and Yu Mo’s purposes were different, his objective was to kill Yang Kai in order to complete the task given to him by Gou Qiong, but now that Yu Mo had called a helper, he suddenly felt that things had become difficult.</p>
<p>His eagerness to stir up trouble was not missed by Yu Mo and even City Lord Man could easily guess what he was thinking, the latter letting out a laugh as he said, “Isn’t this Feng Biao? Instead of staying in Qing Liao City and serving Sir Gou Qiong, you’ve actually come all the way out here to this remote wilderness. What do you plan to do?”</p>
<p>Yu Mo said lightly, “Feng Biao, I’m not interested in embarra.s.sing you today, withdraw!”</p>
<p>Feng Biao coldly snorted before turning his gaze towards Yang Kai, glaring hatefully at him for a moment before turning back to Yu Mo, backing off a short distance, and faintly saying, “If you want to catch him, so be it, I won’t interfere, but everything that’s happened up till now, I will fully report to Sir Gou Qiong. I hope you can afford the consequences!”</p>
<p>Seeing Feng Biao take a stand, Yu Mo no longer spoke any nonsense with him, turning to Yang Kai and sneering, “Little brat, will you surrender without a fight, or do you want me to catch you? I’ll tell you in advance, if you chose the second option, you won’t get off with just some light injuries!”</p>
<p>“Are you so confident that you can catch me?” Yang Kai smiled lightly.</p>
<p>Hearing this, City Lord Man’s eyes bulged for a moment before he snickered dismissively, “Yu Mo, what kind of background does this human kid have? His arrogance is simply heaven defying.”</p>
<p>In front of three Saint Realm masters, actually daring to spout such words, could it be this kid was messed up in the head?</p>
<p>“He has the capital to act so arrogant. Di Xiao was killed by him in the Death Arena of Sand City, one-on-one!” Yu Mo explained faintly.</p>
<p>“What?” City Lord Man was stunned, “Are you sure you aren’t mistaken? That Di Xiao was actually killed by him? He seems like he’s only a Second Order Transcendent!”</p>
<p>“I saw it with my own eyes, how could I be mistaken, and… when he killed Di Xiao, he was only a First Order Transcendent, after killing Di Xiao, he broke through to his present realm.”</p>
<p>“Is that true?” City Lord Man asked in disbelief, shocked to the point of speechlessness.</p>
<p>“Do you think Feng Biao and I would chase after him for an entire month if it wasn’t?” Yu Mo ground his teeth, “f.u.c.k, don’t mention it any more, it’s shameful to even bring it up.”</p>
<p>“Ha ha ha ha!” City Lord Man burst into laughter, a look of ridicule appearing on his face, “You chased after him for a whole month yet still couldn’t catch him?”</p>
<p>As he laughed, his face suddenly became cold and he solemnly said, “If that’s the case, this little brat really must have some skill.”</p>
<h2>Though City Lord Man seemed like a gruff and brutish person, he was no fool. He knew that given Yu Mo’s personality, there was no way he would be praising a human cultivator unless there was no other alternative.</h2>
<p>Realizing this, City Lord Man immediately understood that there was probably something special about this human boy. Killing a Third Order Transcendent with only a First Order cultivation… No one from the Demon Race could accomplish this kind of feat. On top of that, the one who was killed was Di Xiao, a man who always killed people in higher realms than his own; this only further emphasized how absurd this human’s strength must be.</p>
<p>“Gu Man, this time I’ll have to bother you to take action while I stand guard!” Yu Mo glanced over at Feng Biao who was standing not far away, indicating that he obviously didn’t trust Feng Biao and was concerned the latter would try something once he saw an opening.</p>
<p>“No problem, I like destroying the pride and self-confidence of young brats, especially ones like this human… Hah, this will be fun!” Gu Man nodded casually, lifting his head arrogantly as he waved to his hand, “All of you go test his skill. Don’t get careless, I don’t want to have to collect your corpses if you screw up!”</p>
<p>The masters behind City Lord Man all snickered as they turned malicious stares towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yu Mo frowned and faintly felt that this course of action was somewhat improper, but he soon felt that so many people dealing with Yang Kai shouldn’t be a problem so he made no attempt to stop them.</p>
<p>“City Lord, if we catch this human brat, can we get some kind of reward?” One of the masters suddenly asked, apparently wanting to extract some benefits from Gu Man.</p>
<p>“Rewards your a.s.s! Father here was sent to the edge of the Demon Land by Sir Xue Li to serve as City Lord of this desolate waste yet you dare ask me to reward you? If you want something, ask Yu Mo,” Gu Man spat angrily.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yang Kai’s eyes light up as his mouth curled into a slight grin.</p>
<p>Gu Man’s words were nothing but curses and complaints, but they had actually revealed a piece of information that made Yang Kai quite excited.</p>
<p>This place really was at the edge of the Demon Land! That meant that as long as he could escape from here, he could leave the Demon Land.</p>
<p>“Enough! After grabbing him are you still concerned you won’t get any benefits?” Yu Mo shouted, “Gu Man, you never change. If not, how could Sir Xue Li have sent you here? Your short-sightedness is the reason you never make any progress!”</p>
<p>Even after being insulted so, Gu Man didn’t get annoyed and just laughed heartily, “You heard that right? Yu Mo just said that there’ll be reward for catching him. What are you waiting for, hurry up you idiots!”</p>
<p>As soon as the masters behind Gu Man heard this, their auras became fierce as they directed menacing stares towards Yang Kai, quickly spreading out to surround him.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t panic and simply observed his surroundings with cold eyes, secretly preparing to unleash his Spiritual Energy to release his Soul Devouring Insects and kill all the cultivators here below the Saint Realm!</p>
<p>Just as the two sides were on the verge of clas.h.i.+ng though, An Ling’er suddenly shuddered and a look of fear and panic appeared on her pretty face, quickly pulling on Yang Kai’s clothes to get his attention.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Yang Kai brow rose slightly as he asked under his breath, thinking An Ling’er might have sensed the other side trying to pull some kind of trick he had missed.</p>
<p>However, An Ling’er’s beautiful eyes simply trembled as she gently lifted her finger and pointed to the distant horizon, “Over there!”</p>
<p>Unconsciously glancing in the direction she was pointing, everyone was immediately dumbstruck.</p>
<p>In the distance, where the sky met the earth, a thick and tumultuous dark cloud had suddenly appeared and was now rapidly approaching them. From this dark cloud an ominous and eerie aura that made one feel particularly uncomfortable and a potent yet somewhat incoherent Spiritual Energy radiated.</p>
<p>Everyone present paled slightly upon noticing this newcomer.</p>
<p>“Saintess Nan?” Yang Kai asked solemnly.</p>
<p>“It must be!” An Ling’er gently nodded, her beautiful eyes becoming dim and gloomy.</p>
<p>“f.u.c.k!” Yang Kai couldn’t help cursing under his breath. Whether it was being chased by Yu Mo and Feng Biao or being ambushed by Gu Man, Yang Kai was still able to maintain his calm because he still had cards to play. He believed that as long as he used his Devil Transformation, he could successfully bring An Ling’er and escape from here.</p>
<p>But at this critical moment, this never killing before death, after death slaughter a million corpses previous generation Saintess had actually appeared, disrupting all of Yang Kai’s plans and causing him a great deal of anxiety.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had already experienced Saintess Nan’s methods and knew that he was unable to resist her, even if he had broken through to the Second Order Transcendent Realm, he didn’t have any confidence he could flee from her.</p>
<p>Being able to escape from her hands last time was entirely thanks to the Void Corridor at the bottom of the sea, but now that Yang Kai had encountered Saintess Nan in this vast wilderness, there was no possibility of him fleeing successfully.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was agitated, but so were Feng Biao and Yu Mo.</p>
<p>They were both Saint Realm masters, so naturally they were able to sense how tyrannical the approaching person was. This was an existence that caused even them to feel dread.</p>
<p>Just what kind of powerful master would come to this remote place? Unable to understand, they both unconsciously glanced over towards Yang Kai, wanting to obtain some kind of clue from him.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to die, I suggest you let us go, my reinforcements will be here soon!” Yang Kai looked at them coldly, trying his best to put on a calm appearance.</p>
<p>Seeing this though, Yu Mo just snickered, “If the one coming is your reinforcements, why are they directing murderous intent towards you and that woman you’re holding?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai curled his lips helplessly, knowing there was no way he could fool Yu Mo and the other Saints here.</p>
<p>“Boy, you sure know how to stir up trouble, actually provoking such a powerful enemy, you being able to live until today is nothing short of a miracle.”</p>
<p>“Do you think I intentionally go around making powerful enemies?” Yang Kai grumbled indignantly. If he hadn’t inadvertently learned those three Nine Heavens Divine Skills from An Ling’er and become stained with her aura, Saintess Nan wouldn’t be targeting him like this.</p>
<p>“Yu Mo, this aura of that person is a little weird…” Gu Man frowned as he carefully probed the approaching master, feeling that the Death Qi aura coming from them was far too heavy and that they lacked any kind of vitality a living person should have. Shaking his head, he asked, “What should we do?”</p>
<p>“Quickly capture this little brat first!” Yu Mo didn’t dare to delay and immediately tried to seize the initiative. No matter how odd this newcomer’s aura was, Yu Mo was certain they possessed terrifying strength. Even if he and Gu Man joined forces, it was unlikely they’d be able to defeat this person.</p>
<p>Delaying here would only bring them more troubles.</p>
<p>“Don’t bother, I’ll go with you!” Yang Kai said freely and easily, his att.i.tude taking a complete one hundred and eighty degree turn. If he went with Yu Mo and the others, there was a chance he could survive, staying here would only mean certain death. Right now, he still didn’t have the ability to resist Saintess Nan!</p>
<p>“Seems you know your limits, boy,” Yu Mo nodded lightly, expressing satisfaction, but soon his look changed again, a bitter smile appearing on his face, “I’m afraid it’s too late though… this person is too fast!”</p>
<p>Just as these words left his lips, from the dark rolling cloud which was still a fair distance away, a hand seemingly carved of the finest jade stretched out towards them.</p>
<p>As this jade-like hand reached towards them, it grew larger and larger until eventually it seemed to cover the entire sky, blocking out all traces of light!</p>
<p>Heaven Covering Hand! The hand that can cover the Heavens.</p>
<p>The Demon Race masters all began cursing while Yang Kai hastily retreated from this place together with An Ling’er.</p>
<p><em>Hong…</em></p>
<p>The earth shook and the patch of jungle that Gu Man and the others had previous hidden in was blown away, leaving behind only a dozen kilometer long palm print.</p>
<p>It was as if the region had been struck by some kind of natural disaster, the wind whipped and sand and dust flew in every direction. A few of the Demon Race masters with bad luck were unable to escape and were flattened on the spot.</p>
<p>Everyone else, by pus.h.i.+ng their strength to its limits, barely managed to avoid this calamity.</p>
<p>Yu Mo and Gu Man gathered together, both their faces unsightly. Even though the two of them already knew the strength of the approaching person was higher than their own, it wasn’t until the other side attacked that they discovered they had still underestimated this person.</p>
<p>Second Order Saint! This person had at least reached such a realm.</p>
<p>Standing mid-air, Yu Mo and Gu Man didn’t show any fighting intent, only wis.h.i.+ng they could quickly flee from this place, but they didn’t dare make any rash movements because ever since that huge palm had been thrown at them, a powerful Divine Sense had locked onto their bodies. Once they tried to escape, they would certainly be greeted by a ruthless attack.</p>
<p>Both of them took a deep breath and turned their eyes towards a certain spot in the distance. From the direction they were staring, the graceful figure of a woman dressed in a long white dress was slowly approaching.</p>
<p>She had exquisite looks and a n.o.ble and holy temperament; a rare beauty.</p>
<p>But at the moment, her expression was faint, and there was a thick Death Qi between her brows, making her complexion appear somewhat dark.</p>
<p>From her, Yu Mo and Gu Man couldn’t feel the slightest trace of life.</p>
<p>As she walked forward, energy gathered at her slender fingertips, quickly shaping into sharp blades that shot towards everyone around her.</p>
<p>The Demon Race cultivators below the Saint Realm didn’t have the slightest ability to resist and within a few breaths had all been killed by this woman.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Gu Man’s eyes went red as he shouted, “Wh.o.r.e, you dare attack my, Gu Man’s people?”</p>
<p>Yu Mo also wore a gloomy expression as he shouted out, “d.a.m.n woman, not even saying a word before indiscriminately killing everyone in sight, don’t you think you’re going too far?”</p>
<p>Facing the angry roars of these two men, Saintess Nan didn’t respond at all and simply continued to leisurely step forward, her beautiful eyes not even blinking.</p>
<p>In his heart, Yang Kai cheered while maintaining a solemn look upon his face.</p>
<p>Saintess Nan was already dead and obviously wouldn’t respond no matter what Yu Mo and Gu Man said, so naturally Yang Kai was happy to sit back and watch them confront one another.</p>
<p>The only problem now was how to escape from this previous generation Saintess. Even if Yu Mo and Gu Man worked together to intercept her, Yang Kai estimated that they wouldn’t be able to block her for long!</p>
<p>Still standing in mid-air, as they watched Saintess Nan approach, the hairs on Yu Mo and Gu Man’s necks all stood on end, the two of them quickly exchanging a glance before condensing their strength.</p>
<p>They knew that today, they could not avoid fighting this woman.</p>
<p>Even Feng Biao, who had so far been sitting back and observing, began to prepare himself. He too had been locked onto by Saintess Nan’s Divine Sense, so if he wanted to live, he could only temporarily join forces with Yu Mo and Gu Man to resist her.</p>
<p>The three First Order Saints immediately gathered together and relaxed slightly, even if they couldn’t defeat Saintess Nan, working together, they shouldn’t have too much trouble escaping her.</p>
<p>A moment later, when Saintess Nan had approached within three hundred meters of them, a thick Demonic Qi burst out from the three Demon Race Saints, each of them using their full strength to launch a pre-emptive strike.</p>
<p>In response, a giant sword appeared in the sky and immediately slashed down towards the three Demon Race Saints, carrying with it an earth shattering power.</p>
<p>Profound Heavenly Sword!</p>
<p>This giant sword projected an overwhelming power causing Yu Mo, Gu Man, and Feng Biao to tremble in fear.</p>
<h2>The three Saint Realm masters from the Demon Race didn’t know anything about their opponent and instantly found themselves embroiled in a difficult struggle with Saintess Nan.</h2>
<p>Although there were three of them, Saintess Nan’s cultivation was higher than their own by a Minor Realm so she wasn’t at any kind of disadvantage.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Without a word, he quickly pulled An Ling’er and began escaping!</p>
<p>“That d.a.m.ned brat…” Yu Mo saw this but couldn’t do anything about it, grinding his teeth angrily. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to complete his task this time and thus directed his anger towards Saintess Nan, even summoning his Saint Grade artifact and launching one ruthless blow after another towards her.</p>
<p>After the time it would take to burn half a stick of incense , Yang Kai and An Ling’er had managed to flee about a hundred kilometers, but with this much distance between them, they could still feel the fallout from the battle of the four Saint Realm masters, causing them a bit of lingering fear.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had always felt that there was some kind of fundamental difference between the Saint Realm and Transcendent Realm. Yang Kai sensed that the energy flowing in every one of the Saint Realm masters he had met was somewhat different from the True Qi flowing through his meridians.</p>
<p>Not having arrived at such a height, Yang Kai didn’t know much about the secrets of the Saint Realm, so he could only wait and ask about it later.</p>
<p>“Ah…” An Ling’er suddenly shouted, narrowing her eyes as she stared towards a spot in the distance, seemingly sensing something.</p>
<p>At the same time, Yang Kai’s expression also sank. Using his Divine Sense, he had discovered several tyrannical presences in front of them that were rapidly approaching!</p>
<p>The auras of these people were no weaker than Yu Mo’s and one of them was even comparable to Saintess Nan’s!</p>
<p>In this remote wilderness, suddenly encountering so many Saint Realm masters was not something Yang Kai could simply ignore!</p>
<p>Just as Yang Kai wanted to draw An Ling’er away from the approaching masters, the latter suddenly smiled and her expression relaxed, “It’s my Holy Land’s people!”</p>
<p>“Ah?” Yang Kai was shocked.</p>
<p>“We’re saved, it must be a team led by Great Elder Xu Hui!”</p>
<p>Hearing what An Ling’er just said, Yang Kai’s brow wrinkled. Calling all of this a coincidence was a bit of a stretch. However, when he thought about it, if it really was a group of masters from Nine Heavens Holy Land, they only needed to follow Saintess Nan and they could sooner or later find An Ling’er, the premise being that An Ling’er was still alive of course.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s first instinct was to escape. He really didn’t want to have any contact with the people from Nine Heavens Holy Land, but as soon as this idea came up, he immediately dismissed it.</p>
<p>If he were to suddenly flee at this time, it would only cause the approaching group of masters to be suspicious. Also, Yang Kai wasn’t sure what Saintess Nan would do after he separated from An Ling’er. If Saintess Nan were to disregard Yu Mo and the other Demon Race Saints and instead chase after him, he wouldn’t be able to resist. In this situation, Yang Kai’s safest choice was undoubtedly to meet with the masters ahead.</p>
<p>“An Ling’er…” Yang Kai suddenly whispered.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“During this time, how have I treated you?”</p>
<p>“How have you treated me?” An Ling’er was stunned by this question, quickly recalling the events of the past few months, her cheeks blus.h.i.+ng slight as she replied softly, “Very good.”</p>
<p>Whether it was the exploration of the Ancient Ruins, the time spent in the Mysterious Small World, or their stay in the Demon Land, Yang Kai had always taken very good care of her. Even during the times it was difficult for him alone to escape he had never abandoned her, the two of them sharing trials and tribulations together for nearly a year. An Ling’er has long ago regarded Yang Kai as someone she could trust with her life.</p>
<p>“Then do me a favour. When we meet your Holy Land’s people, don’t mention anything about me becoming a Holy Master candidate or about me learning three of the Nine Heavens Divine Skills from you!”</p>
<p>“You don’t want to become Holy Master?” An Ling’er clearly understood Yang Kai’s intentions behind this request.</p>
<p>Yang Kai slowly shook his head, “I’ve told you many times before, even if I don’t become your Holy Master, I can still reach that height. If I become your Holy Land’s Holy Master, I’m afraid it won’t even be three hundred years before I become a pile of bones! I absolutely reject that kind of future as it will make many people sad!”</p>
<p>“Would those people happen to be women?” An Ling’er whispered, his voice containing a hint of bitterness.</p>
<p>“<em>Ahem</em>… only one or two…” Yang Kai’s face became awkward.</p>
<p>“Good, since you so firmly reject the idea, I won’t say any more. When we reach a safe place, you should find a way to leave on your own, I don’t think Great Elder and the others will try to embarra.s.s you,” An Ling’er pursed her lips slightly.</p>
<p>“En,” Yang Kai nodded, his pace remaining unchanged, flying straight ahead to rendezvous with the approaching group of masters.</p>
<p>As the two were speaking, several power Divine Senses swept towards them. After only a brief examination, these Divine Senses revealed a hint of joy and excitement, clearly identifying An Ling’er’s life aura.</p>
<p>A few moments later, a few indistinct figures appeared in Yang Kai’s eyes and from the distance a voice called out, “Is that you, Your Highness Saintess?”</p>
<p>“Great Elder!” An Ling’er responded quickly.</p>
<p>“It really is Your Highness Saintess!” The figures immediately sped up and in the blink of an eye arrived in front of Yang Kai and An Ling’er.</p>
<p>Four Saints!</p>
<p>Leading this group was the so called Great Elder Xu Hui, the one An Ling’er said was a Second Order Saint no worse than Saintess Nan. He was a slightly older man with sharp eyes and a temperate demeanor.</p>
<p>Behind him, there were three other Saints, which should be masters from Nine Heavens Holy Land.</p>
<p>This kind of tyrannical lineup showed just how rich Nine Heavens Holy Land’s heritage was; after all, if the old Holy Master and Saintess Nan were still alive, there would be two more top level masters in this Holy Land.</p>
<p>Soaring Heaven Sect was considered a powerful force, but it only had two Saint Realm masters, Chu Ling Xiao and another old Martial Uncle Yang Kai had never met before.</p>
<p>Compared to Nine Heavens Holy Land, Soaring Heaven Sect was a bit weaker.</p>
<p>With this kind of background, Nine Heavens Holy Land could be considered an extremely powerful and influential force in Tong Xuan Realm, but after the old Holy Master and Saintess Nan fell, Nine Heavens Holy Land’s strength should have fallen greatly.</p>
<p>“This is surely the blessings of the Old Holy Master’s soul in Heaven. Your Highness Saintess is really safe!” Xu Hui quickly cupped his fists and bowed, looking as if a great burden had been lifted from his shoulders. The other three masters also showed similar expressions. It was obvious how worried they were about An Ling’er’s safety, quickly inquiring about her wellbeing the moment they met her.</p>
<p>An Ling’er waved her hand lightly and a.s.sured them she was alright.</p>
<p>As they spoke, the eyes of Great Elder Xu Hui suddenly s.h.i.+fted to Yang Kai, a look of approval flas.h.i.+ng across his face as he asked, “Then this should be the future Holy Master?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face changed slightly, his brow furrowing. This old man saying such words the moment they met had caught him off guard.</p>
<p>An Ling’er was also taken aback and quickly shook her head, “No, Great Elder, you’re mistaken…”</p>
<p>“Ho ho, Your Highness Saintess doesn’t have to explain, everything that happened back in the Seven Family Alliance’s archipelago, we have heard about from Qian Ning!” Xu Hui quickly said, revealing a look of appreciation and satisfaction, “So young yet able to comprehend several Nine Heavens Divine Skills all at once, this is a feat no previous Holy Master has ever achieved.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai was even more shocked now, but he managed to maintain an indifferent expression, showing no intention to speak.</p>
<p>Instead, it was An Ling’er who asked anxiously, “Did Uncle Qian survive?”</p>
<p>Back in that remote archipelago, in order to buy time for Yang Kai and An Ling’er to get away, Qian Ning and the other Nine Heavens Holy Land masters had launched a suicide attack against Saintess Nan. Yang Kai witnessed Saintess Nan kill these masters, leaving not even bones behind, so logically there was no way they could have survived.</p>
<p>Indeed, Xu Hui shook his head and explained, “He died, everyone from that expedition team, with the exception of Your Highness Saintess, died; however, before he fell, Qian Ning managed to send out a message. It was because of this that we learned that the future Holy Master had been found. Ever since then, we have been chasing after Saintess Nan, hoping we would one day find the two of you!”</p>
<p>This was basically the same as what Yang Kai guessed had happened, but when he thought about Qian Ning, he couldn’t help grinding his teeth. If he was determined to die then he should have just died, but in his last moments he had actually caused so much trouble. His death really wasn’t worth pitying!</p>
<p>An Ling’er snuck a peek at Yang Kai, and seeing the unhappy look on his face, she couldn’t help worrying, uncertain of what she should do in this situation.</p>
<p>“This isn’t a place we should stay for long, we must quickly leave!” Xu Hui quickly swept his eyes around as he hurriedly urged.</p>
<p>The other Saints also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s brow wrinkled and finally spoke, “Saintess Nan… do you plan to just ignore her?”</p>
<p>Xu Hui smiled awkwardly and replied, “Saying this will likely make you laugh, but I may not be Saintess Nan’s opponent, so even if we want to stop her, we can’t!”</p>
<p>“Then, from now on, she will always chase after me and An Ling’er?” Yang Kai said in a disgruntled tone.</p>
<p>“Once we return to the Holy Land that won’t be an issue. Once you enter the Holy Land, Saintess Nan will no longer pursue,” One of the other Saint Realm masters quickly said.</p>
<p>“That is why we must swiftly return to the Holy Land!” Xu Hui explained, speaking as politely as possible to Yang Kai, seemingly quite respectful towards him.</p>
<p>The other Saints also showed a polite att.i.tude, so although Yang Kai was unhappy about this situation and didn’t want to have anything to do with Nine Heavens Holy Land, for now he could only agree to follow them back.</p>
<p>Yang Kai decided to observe the situation for now. If on the road things took a turn for the worse, he would immediately separate from this group and not appear before anyone from Nine Heavens Holy Land until he fully matured.</p>
<p>But Xu Hui and the other Saints here knew he had studied several of the Nine Heavens Divine Skills, so Yang Kai worried they wouldn’t easily let him leave, causing him quite some headache.</p>
<p>Seeing him not object, Xu Hui’s expression relaxed and quickly wrapped Yang Kai and An Ling’er in his True Qi before flying off.</p>
<p>A short time later, their group left the Demon Land.</p>
<p>Saintess Nan’s Divine Sense, which had been locked onto Yang Kai and An Ling’er, was also cut off because of the increasing distance.</p>
<p>It was only now that Yang Kai breathed a slight sigh of relief.</p>
<p>As they flew along, Xu Hui appeared calm and composed, but in reality, he was secretly observing Yang Kai, a sense of amazement filling his heart as he did.</p>
<p>He could see that An Ling’er seemed to care deeply about Yang Kai, and not as a Saintess concerned about a future Holy Master, but as a woman concerned about a man. From time to time, when Yang Kai revealed a sullen or dignified expression, An Ling’er would appear panicked and her pulse would race.</p>
<p>This future Holy Master… was really quite extraordinary!</p>
<p>Who An Ling’er was, Xu Hui knew better than anyone else. Which Saintess cultivated by the Holy Land didn’t have eyes atop their head? This future Holy Master actually being able to so quickly capture Her Highness Saintess’ heart fully explained how great his charm and methods were.</p>
<h2>Chapter 791, Forcing Me Will Only Make Me Angry</h2>
<p>From this point alone, it could be seen this young man had gained Her Highness Saintess’ full approval.</p>
<p>What was even more commendable though was this young man’s cultivation, he was actually already a Second Order Transcendent!</p>
<p>All this time, Xu Hui had been speculating about what kind of cultivation the future Holy Master currently had, feeling like it wouldn’t matter even if he was only reached the Immortal Ascension Boundary. With the Holy Land resources and dedicated cultivation, it would only take a few dozen years for him to reach the peak of the Martial Dao, but reality had given Xu Hui a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Such a young Second Order Transcendent was a rarity throughout the entire continent.</p>
<p>Thinking about the message left by Qian Ning before his death, Xu Hui couldn’t help but smile. The more he looked at Yang Kai, the more pleasing he appeared to the eye.</p>
<p>“Right, Your Highness Saintess, how did you escape from the Seven Family Alliance archipelago? As far as I know, that entire island chain was destroyed by Saintess Nan and there were almost no survivors!” Xu Hui asked curiously</p>
<p>An Ling’er glanced over at and upon seeing him nod, she began narrating what happened in the Ancient Ruins beneath the sea.</p>
<p>“A Void Corridor?” Xu Hui brow rose, celebrating in the next breath, “The Heavens truly must be blessing my Holy Land. So, when you came out of the Void Corridor, you found yourselves in the Demon Land?”</p>
<p>“En,” Yang Kai nodded quickly, fearing An Ling’er would let slip what happened in the Mysterious Small World, “After arriving in the Demon Land, we accidentally fell into the hands of Xue Li and only managed to escape a few days ago!”</p>
<p>“Demon General Xue Li?” Xu Hui paled at the mere mention of this name, the other three Saints also showing looks of shock, as if they couldn’t believe Yang Kai and An Ling’er could actually escape from such a master, causing them to greatly admire this pair of juniors.</p>
<p>All of them couldn’t help thinking to themselves at that moment that if they fell into the hands of Xue Li, they would certainly have become prisoners for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>Thinking so, the Saint Realm masters of Nine Heavens Holy Land treated Yang Kai, this future Holy Master, even more respectfully.</p>
<p>Flying past famous mountains and rivers, Xu Hui and the other Saints never once slowed down, crossing several tens of thousands of kilometers every day, having long escaped from Saintess Nan’s pursuit.</p>
<p>On the way, Xu Hui casually inquired about Yang Kai’s origins. Upon learning that he was actually from Soaring Heaven Sect, Xu Hui felt a little surprised.</p>
<p>Soaring Heaven Sect was also considered a powerful force; however, it was quite far from Nine Heavens Holy Land so they had next to no interactions with one another.</p>
<p>“Soaring Heaven Sect also recently experienced a ma.s.sive increase in strength; it seems that they all of a sudden had four new Saints.” At the mention of Soaring Heaven Sect, one of the old men from the Nine Heavens Holy Land team couldn’t help shouting, “Right now, their overall strength may actually be above our Holy Land.”</p>
<p>“Four new Saints?” Yang Kai smiled slightly upon hearing these words, immediately thinking of Cang Yan, Fei Yu, and his other Martial Uncles. It seems like the medicinal liquid of the Thousand Year Demon Flower from Floating Clouds City really helped them break through.</p>
<p>“I also heard about that, it is said that those four went to Floating Clouds City along with an Alchemist nearly two years ago to compete for the Thousand Year Demon Flower’s medicinal liquid… If I remember correctly, the Alchemist who accompanied them was a young man. En, his description is somewhat similar to the future Holy Master!” Saying so, Xu Hui turned a meaningful look towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression however remained indifferent, as if he simply hadn’t heard what was said. Right now, no matter what Yang Kai said, it would only cause more suspicion; this old man Xu Hui had obviously already had some guesses of his own.</p>
<p>However, this old man wasn’t malicious towards him, so Yang Kai was temporarily not worried.</p>
<p>Seeing Yang Kai not respond, Xu Hui just smiled lightly, “There’s no need to envy others. My Holy Land has a new Holy Master, so it won’t be long before our strength recovers to its peak, possibly even growing beyond that!”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right!” The crowd quickly shouted out in agreement, all of them seeming to have great expectations for Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned at this and solemnly said, “Seniors, I have no desire to inherit the position of Holy Master. Once we reach a safe place, I plan to leave.”</p>
<p>“Ah?” Xu Hui was stunned, “You don’t wish to become Holy Master?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded, “I have already spoken with An Ling’er about this many times. I learned three of your Nine Heavens Divine Skills without understanding the implications of doing so. From now on, I can swear not to use these three Divine Skills.”</p>
<p>“This…” A few people suddenly found themselves unable to say anything.</p>
<p>An Ling’er bit her lip lightly and added, “I have a lot of responsibility for this matter, he did not intentionally learn my Holy Land’s Divine Skills, if you wish to blame someone, please only blame me.”</p>
<p>Xu Hui frowned, glancing back and forth between Yang Kai and An Ling’er, his thoughts were unreadable. Suddenly smiling, he said, “Let’s not discuss this matter right now. Seeing how little brother is from Soaring Heaven Sect, we will not embarra.s.s you. If it is convenient, let us first return to the Holy Land so we may properly entertain little brother. After having a look at the Holy Land with your own eyes, if little brother still insists on leaving, we won’t force you to remain!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes flashed and knew that in front of so many Saint Realm masters he couldn’t just refuse.</p>
<p>Once he rejected their offer, it was likely they would instead use forceful means to detain him. Although they wouldn’t harm him, they would definitely find a way to bring him back to Nine Heavens Holy Land.</p>
<p>Xu Hui had already made the biggest concession he could here. Given his status and strength, if he really decided to force Yang Kai to come with them, it would be impossible for Yang Kai to resist, this alone ill.u.s.trated Xu Hui’s sincerity.</p>
<p>“Good!” Yang Kai nodded lightly, wanting to avoid any further disputes for the time being.</p>
<p>Seeing him agree like this, An Ling’er couldn’t help showing a happy smile.</p>
<p>The group continued forward.</p>
<p>Different from the previous harmonious atmosphere though, after learning that Yang Kai did not intend to become the new Holy Master, Xu Hui and the other three Saints suddenly fell silent, constantly meeting eyes while exchanging messages with their Divine Senses, seemingly discussing something.</p>
<p>Yang Kai noticed this but pretended not to.</p>
<p>A short time later, the four Saints suddenly began chattering incessantly, describing the power and heritage of Nine Heavens Holy Land, obviously trying to seduce Yang Kai by explaining all the benefits he could receive by becoming Holy Master.</p>
<p>Yang Kai allowed them to carry on until their tongues grew tired, treating their words like the pa.s.sing wind, never showing the slightest bit of interest, causing Xu Hui and the others to feel somewhat helpless.</p>
<p>However, from their descriptions, Yang Kai gained a better understanding of just how monstrous this force was.</p>
<p>Although each Nine Heavens Holy Land Holy Master did not live a long life, every one of them became a peak Third Order Saint.</p>
<p>As long as it possessed a Third Order Saint, any force would be considered a top force.</p>
<p>Moreover, the way the Holy Master cultivated was different from ordinary cultivators. Inside the Holy Land, there were some places where only the Holy Master could enter. In these sacred grounds, the Holy Master’s strength would grow extremely quickly. How this worked though was something of a mystery to Xu Hui and the other Saints.</p>
<p>With multiple Saintesses a.s.sisting him cultivation, as many as eight and as few as three, it was difficult for each Holy Master’s strength to not improve rapidly. Every Saintess was carefully selected, each one possessing superior apt.i.tude and beauty. These Saintess were also completely obedient towards their Holy Master.</p>
<p>It could be said that as long as one became Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land, not only could he enjoy having three wives and four concubines, but he could also rise to the peak of this world in terms of strength and status.</p>
<p>The only drawback was limited longevity!</p>
<p>Not only was the lifespan of each Holy Master short, so too were the lives of his Saintesses.</p>
<p>The previous Holy Master originally had six Saintesses, but over the past fifty years, five of them had fallen, leaving behind only Saintess Nan.</p>
<p>When the old Holy Master died, Saintess Nan also fell.</p>
<p>The previous generation’s Holy Master and Saintess had all pa.s.sed on, so now all hope for the Holy Land was pinned on Yang Kai and An Ling’er. How could Xu Hui and the others possibly allow Yang Kai to so easily leave?</p>
<p>“Great Elder, what about Xiao Lian and the others?” An Ling’er realized something from Xu Hui’s words and couldn’t help asking.</p>
<p>Xu Hui’s expression immediately became gloomy, and he hesitated for a while before replying, “All of them died. Of this generation’s four Saintesses, only you remain, the other three were killed by Saintess Nan!”</p>
<p>“Ah…” An Ling’er cover her mouth as her eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>She had held out some hope that her sisters had also found appropriate candidates to become the new Holy Master which would allow Great Elder Xu Hui to not force Yang Kai into the position, but those hopes were dashed now by this sad news.</p>
<p>But thinking about it carefully, none of the Saintess’ teams had a Saint Realm master with them, so once they were discovered by Saintess Nan, there would be no way they could escape.</p>
<p>She was extremely fortunate to have met Yang Kai and to have coincidentally learned about the existence of a Void Corridor. If not for those two strokes of luck, her fate would likely have been the same as her three sister Saintesses.</p>
<p>“I am deeply sorry, Your Highness Saintess!” Xu Hui quickly consoled, “As such, the Holy Land’s future depends on the two of you.”</p>
<p>Saying so, he quickly turned to face Yang Kai, “Little brother, please excuse this old master for being so frank, but if little brother refuses to accept the position of Holy Master, I’m afraid within a hundred years the Holy Land will disappear.”</p>
<p>Xu Hui’s words were spoken in a very earnest and dignified tone.</p>
<p>The other three Saints also quickly pleaded, “We too must ask little brother to accept our rude request, the Holy Land’s inheritance cannot end with our generation!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently sighed as he stared off into the distance, “The tides rise and fall, flowers blossom and wilt, such is the way of the world. No force can survive forever, even someone as strong as the Great Demon G.o.d has faded into the annals of history. And… someone suited to become Holy Master are not limited to just me are they? It’s just that An Ling’er has not found another candidate yet.”</p>
<p>“Little brother apparently doesn’t know the whole story, otherwise you would not say such words. Each of our Holy Land’s Saintesses can only choose one candidate to become the next Holy Master, once she had chosen, she will never be able to sense another potential candidate!”</p>
<p>“What you mean to say is that in this world, only I can become your new Holy Master?” Yang Kai frowned, suddenly feeling like the situation had become difficult.</p>
<p>Xu Hui and the others all nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>“If little brother does not agree, then our Nine Heavens Holy Land can only wait for its demise!”</p>
<p>“Little brother, we beg of you, please inherit the position of Holy Master!”</p>
<p>“Don’t try to force me, forcing me will make me angry!” Yang Kai shot them a stern look.</p>
<p>Xu Hui’s expression changed and quickly waved his hands, “We wouldn’t dare!”</p>
<p>Seeing Yang Kai growing impatient, An Ling’er quickly said, “Didn’t Great Elder just say we wouldn’t discuss this matter for now, why are you bringing it up again?”</p>
<p>Xu Hui smiled awkwardly as he said embarra.s.sedly, “This old man was impatient just now, please don’t mind me. Little brother, let us first return to the Holy Land and allow little brother to experience our Holy Land’s culture and livelihood. This old man will certainly entertain you well.”</p>
<p>“En, at this pace we should arrive within three to five days,” Another person quickly chimed in.</p>
<p>Silavin: Well, kinda a loop to throw out but I was questioning the intent of why they did not quickly dispose of Aunt Nan sooner. However, it seems that her death must be too sudden for them to react. It is possible to be suicide. Though, I don’t think that question will be answered any time soon…</p>
<h2>Beautiful scenery all around, extremely rich World Energy, subtle barriers and formations scattered in and around the surrounding mountains, isolating this stretch of land from the outside world.</h2>
<p>Nine Heavens Holy Land!</p>
<p>This ancient force had exited for countless centuries, leaving behind an ill.u.s.trious history. Its strength was outstanding, with few Sects throughout Tong Xuan Realm being its equal.</p>
<p>However, when Yang Kai arrived here for the first time, he felt that this Holy Land was submerged in a somber atmosphere, probably because the old Holy Master had died and the new Holy Master had yet to appear.</p>
<p>Nine Heavens Holy Land, like Soaring Heaven Sect, was situated amongst a mountain range, but unlike Soaring Heaven Sect’s Hundred Peaks Formation, Nine Heavens Holy Land only had a Nine Peaks Formation.</p>
<p>Although this number was relatively small, the arrangement of these nine mountains had a great agreement with the Heavenly Way, so the Spirit Array based on them was no worse than Soaring Heaven Sect’s; in fact, it was even stronger.</p>
<p>Whether it was defensive strength, or the rate at which it gathered World Energy, this Nine Peaks Formation was superior to the Hundreds Peaks Formation.</p>
<p>Amidst these nine spirit peaks, beautiful palaces were scattered about, providing enough shelter for over ten thousand disciples. The entire Nine Heavens Holy Land was like a paradise, br.i.m.m.i.n.g with life and vitality.</p>
<p>When Xu Hui and the other Saints brought Yang Kai and An Ling’er back to the Holy Land, they didn’t bother concealing themselves and instead landed right in the centre of the Holy Land’s great square, as if trying to announce their presence. The old man then leading the way towards a magnificent palace.</p>
<p>On both sides of the road, a large number of the Holy Land’s disciples rushed over to respectfully greet Xu Hui and the other Saints.</p>
<p>Upon seeing An Ling’er’s figure, these disciples would all loudly and enthusiastically call her name while wearing near fanatically expressions regardless of whether they were male, female, young, or old.</p>
<p>As the only unfamiliar face, Yang Kai also gathered a fair amount of attention.</p>
<p>Such a young man, being respectfully escorted by Great Elder Xu Hui and the other Sect Elders, it was easy for these Holy Land disciples to infer this newcomer’s ident.i.ty.</p>
<p>Whispers immediately spread throughout the crowd as the various disciples of Nine Heavens Holy Land quietly pointed to Yang Kai, all of them spiritedly discussing whether this youth was the new Holy Master the Saintess had found, their faces filled with a mix of excitement and curiosity.</p>
<p>It was as if as long as Yang Kai succeeded the position of Holy Master, Nine Heavens Holy Land would be saved!</p>
<p>Those who had slightly better vision and had determined the truth of the matter even began respectfully cupping their fists and bowing to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai on the other hand showed no response, remaining as indifferent as always.</p>
<p>Xu Hui and the other Saints secretly nodded their heads upon seeing this, their evaluation of Yang Kai rising even further.</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai was a disciple of Soaring Heaven Sect, he was still a young man; they had deliberately led him along this path to allow him to experience the wealth and prosperity of the Holy Land as well as evaluate the strength of its disciples. However, even in the face of all of this, Yang Kai had not shown any signs of panic or fl.u.s.ter and remained perfectly calm, as if he had experienced great winds and waves, allowing Xu Hui and the other Saints to hold him in high esteem.</p>
<p>This future Holy Master’s mental strength and temperament were both extraordinary!</p>
<p>Xu Hui and the others all silently exchanged glances, becoming even more determined to make this youth inherit the position of Holy Master.</p>
<p>The entire way was filled with great hustle and bustle.</p>
<p>In front of Yang Kai was a grand palace built of precious stone with many magnificent columns upon which were carved vivid images of dragons and phoenixes.</p>
<p>When they arrived here, Xu Hui turned around and waved his hand gently.</p>
<p>The spectating Holy Land disciples saw this and quickly dispersed, each of them still carrying much curiosity and doubt in their hearts, wondering who this unnamed youth was and whether or not he would inherit the position of Holy Master and save the Holy Land from its current predicament.</p>
<p>“Little brother, please!” Xu Hui lowered his head slightly in a respectful manner.</p>
<p>Yang Kai sighed reluctantly and frowned, “Senior, I have simply come to the Holy Land as a guest, is there any need to be so formal?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Xu Hui understood that Yang Kai was still reluctant to accept the Holy Land, smiling lightly as he nodded, “What little brother said is right, let us go together.”</p>
<p>“En.”</p>
<p>Once inside the palace, under the arrangement of Xu Hui, everyone was seated around a magnificent table and soon, a grand banquet was prepared. Just from looking at it, it was clear that Xu Hui and the other Elders were giving Yang Kai a welcoming reception.</p>
<p>At the banquet, Yang Kai didn’t show any urgency or nervousness, as if he was just an ordinary pa.s.serby, only exchanging a few toasts with Xu Hui while enjoying the lively scene.</p>
<p>Yang Kai found that it was actually quite easy to get along with this old man as long as the latter didn’t mention anything about the Holy Land or Holy Master.</p>
<p>Xu Hui’s strength was high and his background was not shallow, but he was still friendly and approachable; however, Yang Kai knew that this was because this old man was trying to build a good rapport. If Yang Kai was just some other youth, it was unlikely Xu Hui would be behaving so patiently with him.</p>
<p>As wine was served, a group of young girls were called in to perform various songs and dances.</p>
<p>These girls were all quite beautiful and wore thin, yet tasteful robes, revealing just enough to entice one’s fantasies. With a variety of temperaments, yet all showing a refined grace, these young girls were a dazzling sight to behold.</p>
<p>Yang Kai appreciated this show very much but his vision remained clear throughout, without the slightest obscene light.</p>
<p>Sitting beside him, An Ling’er saw this and couldn’t help smiling with satisfaction.</p>
<p>After some excitement, the banquet wound down and Xu Hui and the others also took their leave, never once mentioning anything about the Holy Master position to Yang Kai, appointing a maidservant to lead him to his room.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was taken to a giant room in one of the palace’s wings, its floor covered in luxurious carpeting and its walls decorated with exquisite stones which provided soft lighting. There was an incense burner in its centre that gave off a gentle scent that caused one to relax and feel their tension melt away.</p>
<p>“Young Lord, do you wish to bathe? There is a large pool in the adjacent room with warm water already prepared,” The maidservant asked softly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced over at her briefly before slowly shaking his head and signaling for her to draw back.</p>
<p>The maidservant politely nodded, bowed, and then retired.</p>
<p>After waiting for this young girl to leave, Yang Kai walked over to the door, opened it, and looked at the somewhat hesitant An Ling’er who was outside, “Why are you just standing out here, come inside?”</p>
<p>“Ah… en…” An Ling’er nodded and slowly stepped inside.</p>
<p>“You came at just the right time, I wanted to talk to you about something,” Yang Kai said, grabbing hold of An An Ling’er’s hand and bringing her over to the bed.</p>
<p>An Ling’er’s face blushed slightly but she didn’t put up any resistance and simply let Yang Kai lead her around.</p>
<p>A moment later, sitting on the edge of the bed, she wore a somewhat fl.u.s.tered expression but still managed to maintain her calm.</p>
<p>Yang Kai also sat down on the bed, turned to look at her, and smiled bitterly, “Xu Hui showing me off to your Holy Land’s disciples and bringing in a group of dancers to seduce me. Obviously, he doesn’t have any good intentions.”</p>
<p>“Great Elder just wants you to inherit the position of Holy Master, why do you make it sound so insidious? Also, those girls weren’t mere dancers, they are all excellent disciples of my Holy Land who have gone through a strict selection process. Only when the most distinguished of guests arrive will they be called out to perform,” An Ling’er bit her lip gentle, a slight bit of resentment appearing on her face as she asked once more, “You really don’t want to become Holy Master?”</p>
<p>“I don’t!” Yang Kai shook his head firmly before wrinkling his brow, “Tell me honestly, is what Xu Hui said before really true?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“After you chose me, you can no longer choose another.”</p>
<p>An Ling’er paused for a moment before gently nodding.</p>
<p>“Your Holy Land is really strange, regardless of how you think about it, I’m just an outsider; how can you hand over such an important position like Holy Master to a strange? Why don’t you just select a candidate from within your own ranks?”</p>
<p>An Ling’er simply smiled softly, “This has been our custom since ancient times. I think you’ve heard by now that every Holy Master of our Holy Land has been brought back by us Saintesses from the outside world, yes?”</p>
<p>“En.”</p>
<p>“While that is basically the case, there was one exception… If I recall correctly, the Holy Land’s ancient records state that about nine hundred years ago, the new Holy Master was actually a disciple of the Holy Land. At that time, several Saintesses reacted to him so he was chosen as the new Holy Master, but since then, such a situation has not occurred again. Haa… if a disciple of the Holy Land could become the next Holy Master, we Saintesses wouldn’t have had to go out searching for candidates, then Xiao Lian and them…” Suddenly recalling the fate of her sisters, An Ling’er’s eyes became slightly red.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry…” Yang Kai stuttered awkwardly, not knowing how he should comfort her.</p>
<p>An Ling’er rubbed her eyes, took a deep breath, and calmed herself down, hesitating for a moment before continuing, “If you insist on not becoming Holy Master… I will help you speak to Great Elder and the others.”</p>
<p>“Don’t bother, you’ll just be wasting your time,” Yang Kai shook his head, “Since Xu Hui has already determined that I am the only possible candidate now, no matter what you say, it won’t work.”</p>
<p>“Then what are you going to do?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know…” Yang Kai sighed helplessly. Although Xu Hui wouldn’t dare use too forceful of an approach, he also wouldn’t give up no matter what, causing Yang Kai no small headache.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for the life of each Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land being so short, Yang Kai probably wouldn’t have any problem inheriting the position. After becoming Holy Master and increasing his strength to a certain point, he could just clean up Xu Hui to solve the grudge in his heart.</p>
<p>But the drawbacks of inheriting the position of Holy Master were enough to put Yang Kai off.</p>
<p>An Ling’er looked somewhat embarra.s.sed, her brow knitting slightly as she whispered, “Regardless of anything else, you should stay here for a while. Saintess Nan may be waiting outside, it’s not safe for you to leave right now. Wait a few days and then take a look at the situation again.”</p>
<p>“Good, it seems that’s the only choice,” Yang Kai nodded, “Right, I’ll have to trouble you to send a message to Soaring Heaven Sect telling them that I am well so they don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Rest a.s.sured, I’ll certainly relay your message,” An Ling’er nodded.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“No need to be polite…” An Ling’er smiled, her mood becoming slightly better, leisurely standing up as she said, “Then you rest for now, I’ll head back first. If you need anything, just tell me, I’ll let Xu Hui arrange it for you.”</p>
<p>After An Ling’er left, Yang Kai’s expression became solemn as he quietly released his Divine Sense into his surroundings.</p>
<p>As Yang Kai expected, the palace had a large number of masters hidden just outside, quietly monitoring his every move.</p>
<p>Yang Kai snickered but didn’t care, he knew that Xu Hui would make sure of such arrangements.</p>
<p>However, he had no plans to leave Nine Heavens Holy Land right for the moment. Just as An Ling’er said, Saintess Nan may be waiting outside. Leaving the Nine Peaks barrier now would be akin to walking into a death trap.</p>
<p>Before he could come up with some practical way to evade Saintess Nan, Yang Kai didn’t want to act rashly.</p>
<p>The people of Nine Heavens Holy Land didn’t have any malicious intent towards him, they simply wanted him to a.s.sume the position of Holy Master. So long as he continued to stubbornly refuse, they probably would have no way to force him. In short, this was a battle of wills.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Yang Kai felt he could take advantage of this opportunity to consolidate his cultivation after his most recent breakthrough. Having decided on his short term course of action, Yang Kai’s mood noticeable improved.</p>
<h2>Using his Divine Sense to penetrate every inch of his body, Yang Kai carefully examined all the changes his True Qi and physique had undergone. After breaking through to the Second Order Transcendent Realm, Yang Kai felt that his True Qi’s density and purity had improved significantly once again.</h2>
<p>In that last life or death fight, his physical body had also become st.u.r.dier.</p>
<p>His Spiritual Energy had also undergone a kind of sublimation. Under the constant nourishment of the Six Coloured Soul Warming Lotus, the growth Yang Kai’s Soul had experienced as a result of this breakthrough was quite gratifying.</p>
<p>Right now, Yang Kai felt that even in a frontal collision, his Spiritual Energy strength wouldn’t be weaker than that of a First Order Saint.</p>
<p>Coupled with the potency of his Conflagrated Knowledge Sea, if an ordinary First Order Saint really tried to fight with him in this way, Yang Kai felt he would be the one to come out on top.</p>
<p>This comprehensive rise in strength greatly increased Yang Kai’s confidence. This past year filled with setbacks and misfortune had been like a driving force pus.h.i.+ng him to become stronger.</p>
<p>Any master, in a life or death battle, would be able to gain insights he would otherwise be unable to acquire. Only by pus.h.i.+ng oneself to the edge of death could some things be understood.</p>
<p>It could be said that every true master had experienced many life or death situations, allowing them to temper their spirit, which in turn gave them the will to survive and pursue greater heights of the Martial Dao.</p>
<p>The spoilt children who grew up in greenhouses, sheltered from such trials and tribulations, would no doubt be able to advance smoothly and rapidly upon the road paved for them, but upon encountering even the slightest setback, would become lost and fade from glory.</p>
<p>Yang Kai obviously belonged to the former type. Since he began to cultivate, his path had been filled with thorns, and only by dragging his broken and bloodied body through many life and death crises had he achieved strength far beyond his peers.</p>
<p>Everything Yang Kai now possessed had been won through his own efforts, his strength the result of steadfast determination and hard work, not just luck.</p>
<p>(PewPewLaserGun: You know… except when he found that rock he used as pillow that turned out to be an ancient inheritance of a supreme cultivator…)</p>
<p>(Silavin: Shhh… the author doesn’t want you to think he has too much ‘plot’ amour)</p>
<p>Realizing all of this, Yang Kai’s mentality had gradually undergone some subtle changes, becoming more confident and feeling that as long as he was given enough time, he could rise to the peak of the Martial Dao and overlook all mortal beings.</p>
<p>Calming himself, Yang Kai continued to examine the changes in his body.</p>
<p>What surprised him the most was that the golden blood flowing through his veins seemed to be much more concentrated than before.</p>
<p>Both Li Rong and Han Fei had said that once his blood become completely golden in colour, it would be equivalent to him possessing the blood of the Great Demon G.o.d and would allow him to manifest the Great Demon G.o.d’s Divine Abilities.</p>
<p>The Great Demon G.o.d was a legendary figure, a man recognized by the Three Clans as the first master under Heaven. During his time, no one dared to challenge his majesty.</p>
<p>The wondrous uses of the Demon G.o.d’s Golden Blood were endless. It was because the Demon G.o.d’s Blood flowed through his veins that Yang Kai’s body was so study and his physical strength had reached such an astonis.h.i.+ng height.</p>
<p>Yang Kai could hardly imagine how strong his physique would become once the transformation of his blood was complete.</p>
<p>The reason the Ancient Demon Clan’s bodies were so formidable was because they had inherited some blood from the Great Demon G.o.d. Compared to them though, Yang Kai’s golden blood was undoubtedly the most orthodox inheritance and was thus far purer.</p>
<p>As he immersed his consciousness into the Black Book s.p.a.ce and communicated with the Divine Tree, Yang Kai’s simultaneously circulated his Secret Art and began cultivating.</p>
<p>Just as Yang Kai was constantly growing, so too was the Divine Tree evolving. With Yang Kai’s permission, the Divine Tree had been absorbing a drop of Myriad Drug Liquid every day. Thanks to this, its consciousness seemed to have become clearer and its intelligence was also rapidly increasing; now, not only could it communicate clearly with Yang Kai, it even began asking him questions.</p>
<p>Like he was caring for a young child, Yang Kai did his best to answer the Divine Tree’s inquires.</p>
<p>Time flew by and suddenly more than two months had pa.s.sed since Yang Kai arrived in Nine Heavens Holy Land.</p>
<p>After spending so much time here, Yang Kai had gradually become accustomed to Nine Heavens Holy Land and aside from not being able to leave easily, the treatment he received was quite good.</p>
<p>Great Elder Xu Hui and the other Elders seemed to be receiving him as the highest grade of guest, not only sending him a large number of pills and elixirs to a.s.sist him in his cultivation, but also providing several young beautiful maidservants to tend to his day to day needs; they even brought Yang Kai a large number of Nine Heavens Holy Land’s Martial Skills and Secret Arts for him to use as references.</p>
<p>Aside from not touching any of the maidservants, Yang Kai accepted what he could. He spent all his time diligently, allowing him to quickly consolidate his Second Order Transcendent cultivation.</p>
<p>Xu Hui and the other Saint Realm masters would also visit Yang Kai frequently to chat, though they tactfully avoided the subject of the Holy Master’s succession. Occasionally, when they supposedly had free time, Xu Hui or one of the other Elders would bring Yang Kai out to sightsee and allow him to experience the Holy Land’s rich heritage and natural beauty.</p>
<p>It was obvious they wanted to use such an approach to impress Yang Kai, hoping he would take the initiative to accept the position of Holy Master.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, even after two months of this, Yang Kai’s stance had not changed, causing Xu Hui and the others to grow somewhat anxious.</p>
<p>Atop one of the nine spirit peaks, inside a majestic building, the Holy Land’s Elders and Protectors gathered together for a discussion headed by Xu Hui.</p>
<p>Nine Heavens Holy Land’s original lineup was incredibly strong, with the old Holy Master standing at the top with his Third Order Saint Realm cultivation, followed by Saintess Nan and Xu Hui who were Second Order Saints, then finally the remaining Elders and Protectors Yu Ying, Luo Sheng, s.h.i.+ Kun, Meng Tian Fei, and Cheng Yue Tong. These five people were all First Order Saints, Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong being women.</p>
<p>A single force having so many Saint Realm masters was extremely rare throughout Tong Xuan Realm.</p>
<p>“Great Elder, what is the att.i.tude of the future Holy Master?” A middle-aged beauty Yu Ying asked. She wore a bright red dress that perfectly outlined her rich, mature body. Her skin was smooth and tender and she possessed a graceful style that was complimented by a pair of bright and pure eyes.</p>
<p>Listening to her question, everyone gathered here cast their eyes towards Xu Hui with concern.</p>
<p>In response, Xu Hui frowned and sighed, “He still shows an abundance of reluctance. Although I have never deliberately mentioned this matter during our time together, it is obvious he has no intention of becoming the Holy Land’s next Holy Master.”</p>
<p>“This boy is really quite interesting…” Luo Sheng said with an astonished look upon his face, “Throughout the world, which young man doesn’t want to become the Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land? It’s like reaching the sky with a single step, yet since he arrived here he has always remained indifferent, as if we’re trying to force some unwanted burden onto him.”</p>
<p>“Pay attention to your words, that’s the future Holy Master you’re speaking of, not some random ‘boy’!” Cheng Yue Tong, who wore a sleek white dress, coldly said to Luo Sheng, the latter smiling awkwardly as he glanced over at Great Elder Xu Hui. Upon finding the latter not looking angry, Lou Sheng breathed a quiet sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“However, it truly is quite strange,” Cheng Yue Tong frowned slightly, “Is it possible he disdains to join our Holy Land?”</p>
<p>“How can that be?” s.h.i.+ Kun snorted, “Although the old Holy Master has fallen, our Holy Land is still a great force, second to none in this world. Whether it is fame or heritage, it is far better than his Soaring Heaven Sect, how could he not understand that?”</p>
<p>“It is not impossible!” Xu Hui suddenly said, “I personally took him to visit the Holy Land’s various spirit peaks while showing him the heritage of our Holy Land, and although he listened carefully and offered his praise, he never once showed the shock a young man his age should show, as if everything in his eyes was just fleeting clouds.”</p>
<p>“Did that boy… <em>ahem</em>, the future Holy Master really show such a reaction?” Luo Sheng asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Great Elder, do you know what he likes? If so, we can try to approach him by offering him that,” Meng Tian Fei suggested, “The Holy Land cannot go one day without a Holy Master, yet it has already been over a year since the old Holy Master pa.s.sed away. Fortunately we have sought a future Holy Master and brought him back to the Holy Land, causing quite a stir amongst the disciple. Many of them are wondering when the ascension ceremony will take place and have begun to ask questions. Such uncertainty has even started to affect their cultivation. The situation can’t be left as is for much longer.”</p>
<p>“En,” Yu Ying also nodded, “If we know what he likes, we can retain him. At the very least, we can let him have some sense of belonging to the Holy Land. Only by doing so can we guarantee the Holy Land’s future prosperity.”</p>
<p>“He likes strength!” Xu Hui’s eyes flashed, “After all my observations, I found that the only constant with him is his pursuit of power. Besides that, everything else for him seems superfluous. Even the maidservants I sent to serve him have failed to catch the slightest bit of his attention!”</p>
<p>“There’s actually a young man in this world who doesn’t like beauties?” Luo Sheng’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets, as if he had just heard something unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Do you think everyone is like you, obsessed with women?” Yu Ying coldly snorted, her expression becoming unpleasant, causing Luo Sheng’s neck to shrink up.</p>
<p>“Could it be he likes Her Highness Saintess and is putting on such a performance for her?” Cheng Yue Tong suddenly thought of a possibility. In front of a woman he favoured, no man wanted to show off his ugly side, many of them even often trying to appear n.o.ble and heroic in order to attract the other party’s attention. If it was because of Saintess An Ling’er, Yang Kai acting so would not be unusual.</p>
<p>Everyone gathered here was a seasoned person and understood this point.</p>
<p>However, Xu Hui just smiled bitterly, “It’s not like that. On the contrary, it is Her Highness Saintess who adores him, yet he seems to only treat her as a friend.”</p>
<p>“Poor Ling’er…” Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong both muttered, feeling somewhat mournful.</p>
<p>The two of them had watched over An Ling’er as she grew up, so naturally they had some sentiments towards her.</p>
<p>“The future Holy Master is no ordinary person…” Xu Hui suddenly said, “I have never met such a young Second Order Transcendent before, have you?”</p>
<p>Everyone shook their heads.</p>
<p>“Soaring Heaven Sect… they’ve raised a rare genius. But it’s strange we have never heard anything about him up till now. Such an outstanding youth should be famous throughout the world yet he has somehow managed to remain hidden all this time, it’s seriously incomprehensible! Moreover, he actually brought Her Highness Saintess and escaped from Demon General Xue Li’s hands. I can’t even imagine how he accomplished that.”</p>
<p>“He also escaped from Saintess Nan’s pursuit…”</p>
<h2>As these words were spoken, everyone’s heart quietly filled with shock one more.</h2>
<p>Having never discuss the matter, no one had paid it much mind, but thinking about it now, it was really an unbelievable feat. A Second Order Transcendent repeatedly escaping from Saint Realm masters determined to capture or kill him, and even bringing another person along with him, this would only be possible with either Heaven defying luck or possessing astonis.h.i.+ng methods.</p>
<p>The people gathered here were more inclined to believe it was the latter of the two possibilities, making it even more difficult for them to estimate Yang Kai’s real depths.</p>
<p>Those who became Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land had come from all different walks of life and their apt.i.tudes had ranged from outstanding to below average.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if a particular generation’s Saintesses only brought back a low level Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivator, Nine Heavens Holy Land was confident it could cultivate them into a top level master, not to mention Yang Kai whose apt.i.tude and starting cultivation were simply a hundred times better than that.</p>
<p>“In any case, we must find a way to let him inherit the position of Holy Master! Without the Holy Master’s Spirit Ring, many critical locations in the Holy Land cannot be opened. This matter cannot be delayed any further!” Xu Hui suddenly declared firmly.</p>
<p>“But isn’t he still unwilling?” Yu Ying frowned, feeling the situation was somewhat awkward.</p>
<p>“So what if he’s not willing? With so many Saint Realm masters here are you saying we can’t even accomplish this?” s.h.i.+ Kun said, evidently growing impatient.</p>
<p>“Do you want to use force?” Yu Ying’s eyes narrowed as she stared at s.h.i.+ Kun coldly.</p>
<p>“I also had such intentions!” Xu Hui let out a long breath, “His manner is very firm, and continuing to wait won’t help matters. Given that, we might as well take a gamble and send him into the Holy Tomb!” “</p>
<p>As soon as this statement came out, everyone’s brow wrinkled. It seemed that this Holy Tomb contained danger that caused even Saint Realm master like them some anxiety.</p>
<p>“If… if he can’t come out?” Cheng Yue Tong asked, a hint of worry in her voice, “Ling’er is the only Saintess left in this generation and she has already chosen him so she won’t be able to find a second candidate. If he fails to come out…”</p>
<p>“If he can’t come out, then my Holy Land can only seclude itself from the world and wait for the next generation of Saintesses to mature.”</p>
<p>The next generation of Saintesses had not even been selected yet, so it would be at least twenty years before they could mature. Twenty years may not seem long, but if the Holy Land lacked a Holy Master, no one could obtain the old Holy Master’s Spirit Ring from the Holy Tomb and many important places would be inaccessible. Not having access to these critical locations would be enough to bring down even a colossus like Nine Heavens Holy Land.</p>
<p>This was the reason why for the past two months these Saints had not dared to act rashly, but seeing Yang Kai remain so stubbornly opposed had caused Xu Hui to think twice.</p>
<p>“But he has yet to fully comprehend all of the Nine Heavens Divine Skills, how is he supposed to go inside? It is said that the Holy Tomb is the place where the Nine Heavens Divine Skills were created and one needs to be proficient in them in order to enter.”</p>
<p>“He has learned three of the Divine Skills, that should be enough. This is all for my Nine Heavens Holy Land. Even if he is the future Holy Master, if he must be sacrificed then we must not hesitate!” Xu Hui shouted, “If he can come out smoothly, presumably he will be grateful for our decision today!”</p>
<p>“Good!” s.h.i.+ Kun, Meng Tian Fei and the others nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>No Holy Master had ever come out of the Holy Tomb and not had a sense of belonging to the Holy Land. The reason these Holy Masters who were brought back by the Saintesses dedicated their lives to the Holy Land was inseparable from the secrets contained inside the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>Although no one here knew what exactly was hidden inside Holy Tomb, they were all well aware of this point.</p>
<p>Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong, the two middle-aged beauties both had uncertain expressions on their faces, obviously not fully onboard with this idea, but under the circ.u.mstances they knew not to raise any objections here.</p>
<p>Having come to a consensus, this group of Saints quickly took action, preparing to send Yang Kai into the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>The next day, Yang Kai, who was meditating inside the palace, opened his eyes upon perceiving Xu Hui and the other Elders approaching.</p>
<p>Yang Kai also noticed that something was a little different this time. This time, the ones who had come weren’t only the ones he had seen before, but even some he had never met before.</p>
<p>Although they did their best to conceal it, Yang Kai could sense a kind of solemn and serious mood from these people’s breathing and aura, causing him to become somewhat alert, not knowing what they were planning.</p>
<p>A moment later, there was a knock at the door. After Yang Kai allowed them to enter, the door was pushed open and Xu Hui and the other Elders and Protectors all stepped inside.</p>
<p>Yang Kai couldn’t help raising his brow, faintly feeling that Xu Hui was about to tell him something important related to the Holy Master’s position. If not, there would be no need to a.s.semble all of the Holy Land’s masters here.</p>
<p>After exchanging greetings, Xu Hui introduced Yang Kai to the other Elders a.s.sembled here, Yang Kai politely greeting them in turn.</p>
<p>“What important matter does Great Elder have to discuss today?” Yang Kai asked bluntly, making no attempt to hide his own wariness.</p>
<p>“Today I want to ask little brother to accompany us to a certain place!” Xu Hui showed a faint smile and said kindly.</p>
<p>“I believe I have toured your entire Nine Peaks region, are there still other places I’ve yet to see?”</p>
<p>“En, my Holy Land has a number of restricted areas that little brother isn’t normally able to see. Today we wish to take you to one of them.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed and asked, “Since it is a restricted area, isn’t it inappropriate for an outsider like me to visit it?”</p>
<p>“Little brother is not an outsider, and on top of that, no one may enter this particular place except little brother!” Xu Hui replied solemnly.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brow, “No one but I can enter. Does that mean that only those qualified to become Holy Master may enter this place you speak of? Heh heh, this matter, can I refuse?”</p>
<p>Xu Hui’s expression became somewhat embarra.s.sed as he cupped his fists and said, “I must ask little brother to forgive our forcefulness. Please accompany us!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently sneered, sweeping his eyes over the Saint Realm masters in front of him, secretly estimate what kind of chance he would have if he were to put up a resistance here, quickly dismissing the idea.</p>
<p>There were simply too many people here, and each of them was a powerful Saint. Yang Kai felt that even if he used his full strength he wouldn’t be able to escape from here.</p>
<p>Considering all this, Yang Kai’s look relaxed and shrugged his shoulders, “Then… I must ask you to show me the way.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, everyone smiled happily, Xu Hui especially as he quickly motioned, “Please!”</p>
<p>Xu Hui had thought that today there would be have to deal with some unpleasantness with this future Holy Master and had made up his mind to use whatever means necessary should Yang Kai resist to bring the latter to the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>So it came as a pleasant surprise when Yang Kai actually took a step back and agreed to go with them, allowing him to avoid an awkward situation. After all, if Xu Hui were to displease the future Holy Master today, there was no telling what kind of retaliation he would face in the future.</p>
<p>Once outside the palace, everyone surrounded Yang Kai and quickly flew towards one of the spirit peaks. This group appeared completely casual at the moment but in fact, they were all paying close attention to Yang Kai’s movements; once he showed any signs of resistance, there was no doubt they would immediately take action against him.</p>
<p>“Great Elder, can you tell me where you’re taking me this time?” Yang Kai asked on the way.</p>
<p>Xu Hui hesitated for a moment before honestly replying, “The Holy Tomb!”</p>
<p>“Holy Tomb?” Yang Kai was stunned, “Why does that sound like some kind of burial place?”</p>
<p>“You’re not wrong,” Xu Hui nodded heavily, “When each of my Holy Land’s Holy Masters realize their time of death is approaching, they will enter the Holy Tomb! So it is indeed a burial ground. It is the resting place for all of my Holy Land’s previous Holy Masters!”</p>
<p>“Is it dangerous?” Yang Kai asked with a smiling, seemingly just casually making conversation.</p>
<p>“For any of us, it truly is dangerous. Anyone who is not a candidate to become Holy Master will die if they enter, but for little brother, it can be thought of as a kind of final test!”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Xu Hui once again hesitated to respond.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai immediately said, “If you don’t want to say then don’t bother. I don’t have any interest in learning others secrets, especially ones of such importance. The more one knows, the more dangerous it is for them.”</p>
<p>To Yang Kai’s words, Xu Hui smiled awkwardly, “It’s not that it is impossible to say… Since things have reached this point, this old master won’t hide anything from you. Little brother only knows that each new Holy Masters is brought back by the Saintesses from the outside world, but what you may not know is that every time the Saintesses go out to make a selection, more than one candidate is brought back. This is because my Holy Land has several Saintesses in every generation and each of them finds a Holy Master candidate according to their own vision and Secret Art’s induction. Through the installment of each Saintess, these candidates comprehend the Nine Heavens Divine Skills and then enter the Holy Tomb. Only the one who can return from the Holy Tomb alive will then become the true Holy Master!”</p>
<p>“Then it seems I’m quite lucky, there’s no one to compete with me this time,” Yang Kai said sarcastically.</p>
<p>Xu Hui just laughed awkwardly and nodded, “You can say that.”</p>
<p>“What’s inside?” Yang Kai asked, his tone suddenly becoming serious.</p>
<p>“This old master doesn’t know… I only know that it is the place where all previous Holy Masters are buried. Other than that, I know nothing else about what is inside. Not only me, the other Protectors and Elders have no knowledge of what is contained inside the Holy Tomb because only those who have learned the Nine Heavens Divine Skills are eligible to enter!”</p>
<p>“So what you mean is, the Nine Heavens Divine Skills are the key to entering?” Yang Kai asked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Most likely; however, what is certain is that there are real dangers inside. Little brother, once you enter, you must be careful, negligence will only result in irredeemable accidents.”</p>
<p>Cheng Yue Tong quickly added here, “Although there are dangers, there are also many benefits.”</p>
<p>“Benefits?” Yang Kai turned to her, his interest immediately piqued, “What kind of benefits? Explain clearly.”</p>
<p>Cheng Yue Tong smiled and continued, “I can’t say for certain, but whenever they needed to enter secluded retreat, all previous Holy Master would choose to do so here, and each time they came out after, their strength would improve greatly. On top of that, each time the old Holy Master entered, he would obtain some fair gains from inside.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, the artifact used by the old Holy Master was brought out from the Holy Tomb. That was a Saint Grade Top-Rank artifact. There aren’t many such artifacts in the entire world!”</p>
<p>“Every artifact used by the previous Holy Masters was similarly powerful, and all of them are buried inside the Holy Tomb. So to speak, this is a big opportunity for little brother. Perhaps you may be able to obtain a useful artifact from inside,” Xu Hui elaborated.</p>
<p>“Saint Grade Top-Rank artifacts? Why didn’t you say so earlier! If you had told me that from the beginning, I’d have already entered that Holy Tomb, there would have been no need for all these games!” Yang Kai suddenly looked very excited.</p>
<p>Everyone was dumbstruck.</p>
<p>“Taking risks is one of the things I enjoy most,” Yang Kai grinned, an unreadable expression appearing on his face, “The more dangerous the place, the more I feel like visiting it, especially places like your Holy Tomb where even surviving is not a certainty!”</p>
<p>Xu Hui’s face twitched upon hearing this, suddenly finding that he couldn’t completely understand Yang Kai.</p>
<h2>Chapter 795, Cracking</h2>
<p>Xu Hui and the others soon brought Yang Kai to the base of one of the nine peaks.</p>
<p>Yang Kai looked around curiously for a moment but the only thing of note he could see was a flat stone embedded in the mountainside with two magnificent words carved into its slightly mossy surface.</p>
<p>Holy Tomb!</p>
<p>This was obviously the entrance to the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>Yang Ka’s brow rose. Although he couldn’t see anything with his eyes, he noticed a faint energy fluctuation coming from this stone slab in front of him.</p>
<p>Xu Hui stepped forward and formed a few mysterious hand seals before patting his hand on the stone, causing ripples across its surface, as if a stone had been thrown into a calm lake. A moment later, a hole appeared in the center of the stone.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this hole, Yang Kai couldn’t help calling out in shock, “A Void Corridor!”</p>
<p>Xu Hui gently nodded, “Good. Beyond this lies the Holy Tomb, the final resting place of all previous Holy Masters. Naturally, the inside of the Holy Tomb is a Mysterious Small World. Every perspective Holy Master has to pa.s.s this test before officially succeeding the position. Little brother, you must be careful inside. If nothing else, you must bring out the Holy Master’s Spirit Ring which should be with the old Holy Master, it is the key to many important places in the Holy Land.”</p>
<p>“En, you must surely come back alive!” Yu Ying said seriously.</p>
<p>“The Holy Land’s future rests in your hands,” Cheng Yue Tong whispered solemnly.</p>
<p>Everyone else also wore looks of antic.i.p.ation and concern as they stared at Yang Kai.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yang Kai just glanced around at them and chuckled, “I think you should instead pray I never come out.”</p>
<p>“Why is that?” Xu Hui asked curiously.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes flashed a cold light as he glared at them, “If I come out, I’ll make sure you pay for this!”</p>
<p>Everyone was startled by these words and only now realized just how angered Yang Kai was at being forced to enter the Holy Tomb, but before any of them could say anything, Yang Kai plunged into the Void Corridor and disappeared.</p>
<p>“This future Holy Master is clearly one to hold a grudge… It can’t be he really plans to seek compensation from us after exiting, right?” s.h.i.+ Kun frowned.</p>
<p>Xu Hui’s expression also fluctuated, letting out a deep sigh a moment later, “It seems his disposition… isn’t very mature.”</p>
<p>“Well, in any case, all of this was Great Elders proposal, we just went along with it. If the future Holy Master really does intend to blame us, Great Elder will be here to shoulder the responsibility!” Meng Tian Fei said, clearly taking some pleasure in Xu Hui’s misfortune.</p>
<p>All the other Saints immediately cast contemptuous looks towards him.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Once Yang Kai entered the Holy Tomb, the Void Corridor closed. All around him, fluorescent green wisps floated about, like tiny spirit. A cold breeze gently permeated this s.p.a.ce, carrying with it indistinct cries and howls, causing one to shudder.</p>
<p>The ambient light was not bright, leading to limited visibility, but the density of World Energy was quite astonis.h.i.+ng, so thick it had almost condensed into a white fog that filled this s.p.a.ce.</p>
<p>This Mysterious Small World had richer World Energy than any place Yang Kai had ever seen with the exception of an Earth Vein. It was obvious why each Nine Heavens Holy Land’s Holy Master would choose to enter retreat here.</p>
<p>With this kind of ambient World Energy, one wouldn’t even need to use any pills or Crystal Stones to cultivate; all they’d need to do is breathe.</p>
<p>This was indeed a cultivation paradise, the only drawback being its gloomy atmosphere.</p>
<p>As he observed his surroundings vigilantly, Yang Kai couldn’t help going slightly pale.</p>
<p>In his perception, several powerful energy auras had suddenly appeared and were rapidly moving towards him.</p>
<p>These auras were extremely strange. They seemed to have always been here but only when Yang Kai appeared did they become active.</p>
<p>Before Yang Kai had time to react, these energy auras had already engulfed him.</p>
<p>Yang Kai hurriedly condensed his True Qi into a protective barrier but soon he found that things weren’t what he had expected.</p>
<p>These strange energy auras that had gathered around him weren’t causing him any harm.</p>
<p>Wrinkling his brow, Yang Kai carefully examined these auras and a moment later a look of shock appeared on his face.</p>
<p>He found that there were a total of nine distinct energy auras, each of them containing a profound and abstruse sentiment, similar to a remnant Soul yet seemingly naturally produced.</p>
<p>Three of these energy auras also contained something which felt familiar to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Carefully probing one of these auras with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai immediately recognized traces of one of the Nine Heavens Divine Skills.</p>
<p>The Profound Heavenly Sword!</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression changed and a certain suspicion appeared in his heart. Quickly probing the other two energy auras he felt a sense of familiarity towards, he soon recognized them as insights of the Imprisoning Heaven Chain and Great Heavenly Attraction.</p>
<p>These three Divine Skills were exactly the three moves Yang Kai had learned from An Ling’er, yet now they had appeared in this place.</p>
<p>[So, these nine auras in front of me are the nine, Nine Heavens Divine Skills?] Yang Kai frowned slightly, almost certain of his guess.</p>
<p>That old fart Xu Hui had said that in order to enter the Holy Tomb, one must learn the Nine Heavens Divine Skills, because only if one comprehended the Nine Heavens Divine Skills could they enter safely.</p>
<p>The nine energy auras in front of him should be obstacles meant to test him. Without breaking through them, he couldn’t penetrate further into the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>Yang Kai instantly understood the mystery of this Holy Tomb. After thinking about it, he sat down cross legged in front of the energy aura that represented the Profound Heavenly Sword.</p>
<p>The Nine Heavens Divine Skills were all quite unusual, they could be displayed as Martial Skill with True Qi or as Soul Skills with Spiritual Energy, something Yang Kai had never encountered before.</p>
<p>If he wanted to break through this barrier, Yang Kai’s only choice was to comprehend and displays all of the Nine Heavens Divine Skills.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s Divine Sense burst forth and his invisible Spiritual energy quickly transformed into a giant sword that cut towards the energy aura in front.</p>
<p>Nothing happened though!</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s powerful Divine Sense attack had vanished into the energy aura, like a drop of water sinking into a vast sea.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s brow furrowed, using his Profound Heavenly Sword a few more times to attack the energy aura yet each time he failed to achieve any noticeable results.</p>
<p>Yang Kai suddenly felt that this test might not be as simple as he originally thought.</p>
<p>After carefully recalling what Xu Hui and the other Saints had said and reviewing everything he had learned about Nine Heavens Holy Land, Yang Kai suddenly thought up a possibility.</p>
<p>Could it be that he was not skilled enough at displaying the Nine Heavens Divine Skills causing him to fail to break through the blockade of this energy aura in front of him?</p>
<p>Yang Kai had learned his Nine Heavens Divine Skills from An Ling’er, so his comprehension of them was only as good as hers. An Ling’er was still young so her understanding of the Divine Skills was still somewhat immature. As such, it was reasonable that Yang Kai couldn’t display the full profoundness of the Divine Skills.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had witnessed Saintess Nan using the Profound Heavenly Sword, it was on a completely different level than his own. Obviously Saintess Nan’s comprehension of the Divine Skills had reached an extremely high level.</p>
<p>Moreover, each prospective Nine Heavens Holy Land Holy Master had to enter the Holy Tomb before he could qualify to inherit the position. What was most important though was that those who came before Yang Kai didn’t necessarily have higher strength yet they had pa.s.sed through the Holy Tomb, so the conditions to clear this test had nothing to do with strength, it only depended on one’s comprehension of the Nine Heavens Divine Skills!</p>
<p>Considering all this, Yang Kai didn’t rush to show his poor Nine Heavens Divine Skills but instead immersed his consciousness in the Profound Heavenly Sword energy aura in front of him, carefully perceiving its mysteries.</p>
<p>As time pa.s.sed, Yang Kai gained much, repeatedly comprehending the insights contained within the Profound Heavenly Sword energy aura, his understanding of its mysteries constantly deepening, soon becoming so familiar with it; it was as if it had been branded into the depths of his soul.</p>
<p>When Yang Kai opened his eyes again, he discovered he could perceive the various traces within the energy aura in front of him and all of its mysteries and hidden rules had become clear.</p>
<p>Spiritual Energy bursting forth once more, Yang Kai again displayed the Profound Heavenly Sword.</p>
<p>This time, Yang Kai used the purest form of this Nine Heavens Divine Skills, its profoundness several times greater than the one he learned from An Ling’er.</p>
<p>With a great cracking sound, the energy aura in front which was bombarded by Yang Kai’s Profound Heavenly Sword shattered.</p>
<p>A long winding road suddenly appeared in front of Yang Kai, leading straight into the depths of the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled slightly and instantly understood the mysteries behind this Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>For those who entered here that hadn’t practiced the Nine Heavens Divine Skills, they would likely be torn to dust by these nine energy auras, but those who had were different. As long as one could crack any of these energy auras, they could then find their way out.</p>
<p>On top of that, the more of these energy auras one solved, the clearer their path and the safer they would be!</p>
<p>What Xu Hui said was right, the Nine Heavens Divine Skills were indeed the key to entering the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t immediately rush forward but instead turned his attention to the other energy auras.</p>
<p>In any case, he had been forced into the Holy Tomb by Xu Hui and the others. If he didn’t fish enough benefits from here before going out, wouldn’t that be too much of a waste?</p>
<p>Each of the Nine Heavens Divine Skills was incredibly powerful and profound. After seeing Saintess Nan display them multiple times, Yang Kai had already had ideas about learning them. Now that such a good opportunity had appeared in front of him, how could he simply pa.s.s it up?</p>
<p>Not to mention that by solving more of these energy auras, Yang Kai would be safer in this place.</p>
<p>Making up his mind, Yang Kai immediately began to spy on the mysteries of the other two Nine Heavens Divine Skills he was familiar with.</p>
<p>Four days later, he cracked the Imprisoning Heaven Chain energy aura, then three days after that the Great Heavenly Attraction energy aura was solved…</p>
<p>After that point, Yang Kai’s pace slowed noticeably. The first three Divine Skills he had already learned a fair deal about from An Ling’er so his starting proficiency was quite high. The remaining six though, were Divine Skills he had never studied before, naturally this meant Yang Kai had to start from scratch. It was fortunate that these energy auras contained all the mysteries of the Divine Skills within them, so all he had to do was study and comprehend.</p>
<p>Cultivation knew no years. This saying was not false, as Yang Kai immersed himself in the Nine Heavens Divine Skills inside the Holy Tomb, he quickly lost track of time. On the other hand, the Elders and Protectors outside the Holy Tomb quickly began to worry.</p>
<p>For the first few days after Yang Kai entered, all of them held great expectations, hoping he would suddenly emerge from the Holy Tomb, bring with him the Holy Master’s Spirit Ring, and inherit the position of Holy Master.</p>
<p>Ten days later, everyone became slightly anxious, although none of them said anything out loud; all of them began wondering if Yang Kai had encountered some kind of difficulties inside.</p>
<p>A month later, everyone’s expression had become dignified.</p>
<p>Two months later, despair appeared on their faces and forlorn sighs could be heard frequently.</p>
<p>Three months, four months…</p>
<p>As time pa.s.sed, fewer and fewer Elders and Protectors remained here, all of them now believing it was impossible for Yang Kai to appear before them again.</p>
<h2>Martial Peak – Chapter 796, Completely Comprehending the Nine Divine Skills</h2>

<p>Every Holy Master candidate who entered the Holy Tomb had to pa.s.s this test. This was well doc.u.mented in Nine Heavens Holy Land’s historical records.</p>
<p>Xu Hui and the other Elders naturally knew that this process would take some time.</p>
<p>The fastest time a candidate had cleared the Holy Tomb’s test was fifteen days, while the slowest one took two months.</p>
<p>However, it had now been four months since Yang Kai entered the Holy Tomb and there was no sign of him, this led Xu Hui and the others to believe Yang Kai was already dead.</p>
<p>The various Protectors and Elders all sighed heavily as they departed one by one; they all held important positions and had many things to deal with, how could they continue to wait here in vain?</p>
<p>Even Xu Hui, who had initiated this matter, left after four months.</p>
<p>Only An Ling’er remained outside the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>Three days after Yang Kai entered the Holy Tomb, An Ling’er learned of this incident, but even though she immediately rushed over and openly complained to Xu Hui and the other elders, there was nothing that could be done.</p>
<p>These past four months she had been waiting here, but no matter how eager she was, Yang Kai never appeared.</p>
<p>On a certain day, two beautiful women, Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong, came together and saw An Ling’er still standing outside Holy Tomb, causing the two of them to sigh.</p>
<p>“This little girl, she’s still waiting here,” Yu Ying said faintly.</p>
<p>“We were too anxious, not only have we ruined our Holy Land’s one hope, we also destroyed a bright young man’s future,” Cheng Yue Tong’s pretty face also flashed a trace of embarra.s.sment and remorse.</p>
<p>“What use is saying this now? When Great Elder made this proposal, we didn’t raise any objections, all of us carry some responsibility,” Yu Ying slowly shook her head. “Fortunately, the one this little girl sent to deliver a message to Soaring Heaven Sect was intercepted by Great Elder, otherwise, if Soaring Heaven Sect were to learn about this, they would certainly not let our Holy Land off.”</p>
<p>“En, such an outstanding young talent, no matter which Sect he belonged to, would be vigorously cultivated,” Cheng Yue Tong said with a hint of anxiety.</p>
<p>Right now, Nine Heavens Holy Land was now suffering from many external troubles, if they suddenly made enemies of Soaring Heaven Sect as well, it was likely they would need to immediately activate the Nine Peaks Array and isolate themselves from the outside world. If that were to happen, even if they raised a new generation of Saintesses, they would not be able to leave to seek out a new Holy Master.</p>
<p>“In the end, did we think too highly of him, or did he just happen to have bad luck?” Yu Ying sighed, “Each of the past Holy Master candidates received some advice and guidance from the previous Holy Master before entering the Holy Tomb, but this time he had to dive in completely unprepared, it must have been too difficult for him…”</p>
<p>“Let’s go take a look,” Cheng Yue Tong said, stepping forward.</p>
<p>A moment later, the two of them arrived in front of the Holy Tomb. An Ling’er, who heard movement behind her, turned her head and saw them arrive, nodding her head slightly to greet them before turning around again.</p>
<p>In the past, An Ling’er and these two female Elders were quite close, but the relations.h.i.+p between them had now grown a bit cold, obviously as a result of them forcing Yang Kai to enter the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>Exchanging a somewhat depressed glance with one another, Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong didn’t know how to comfort this young girl and instead stood there staring at the entrance to the Holy Tomb awkwardly.</p>
<p>After a long silence, Yu Ying finally spoke up, “Ling’er, don’t wait any longer, it’s unlikely he’ll be able to come out.”</p>
<p>An Ling’er just shook her head in response.</p>
<p>“Listen to us, go back and rest, you’ve been waiting here for four months already,” Cheng Yue Tong also advised.</p>
<p>“He will come out,” An Ling’er said solemnly in a firm tone.</p>
<p>Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong were stunned for a moment before the two of them wore forced smiles and asked, “How do you know that? No Holy Master has ever taken so long to return from the Holy Tomb.”</p>
<p>An Ling’er just confidently said, “Just because others couldn’t, doesn’t mean he can’t. None of you have witnessed his skill, so it’s only natural for you to think that way, but I know he will come out.”</p>
<p>The two beautiful women narrowed their eyes and tentatively asked, “What kind of skill does he possess to makes you evaluate him so highly?”</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai’s apt.i.tude was obviously uncommon and his strength wasn’t bad, the two middle-aged beauties had never actually seen him take action so naturally they didn’t know his true depths. An Ling’er on the other hand was different, the time she spent with Yang Kai was not short, so she was obviously clearer on his details.</p>
<p>Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong suddenly became somewhat curious and wanted to find out more from An Ling’er.</p>
<p>“I can’t explain it too well, but he can always manage to pull off miracles one after another. Surprising those around him to no end. On top of that, he said… even if it doesn’t enter my Holy Land, he will reach the same height as the old Holy Master within thirty years!”</p>
<p>“The same height?” Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong both wore stunned expressions, “The peak Third Order Saint Realm?”</p>
<p>An Ling’er nodded sincerely.</p>
<p>Yu Ying smiled wryly, “He is now a Second Order Transcendent, wanting to become a Third Order Saint within thirty years… I’m afraid that’s impossible.”</p>
<p>“En, there aren’t many Third Order Saints in the entire world,” Cheng Yue Tong also smiled, the two women apparently thinking that Yang Kai was just shamelessly boasting.</p>
<p>Both of them were well aware of how difficult it was to improve one’s strength after reaching the Transcendent Realm. Their apt.i.tudes were considered excellent, or else it would be impossible for them to have reached the Saint Realm, but even they had trouble progressing now.</p>
<p>Even if Yang Kai’s apt.i.tude exceeded their own; impossible things were still impossible.</p>
<p>In this world, which Third Order Saint was not at least a hundred years old? Even if they looked young, each one of them had experienced the long pa.s.sage of time and only through constant acc.u.mulation had they reached their current height.</p>
<p>Yang Kai seemed to only be in his twenties, saying he could reach such a level within thirty years, wasn’t that like saying he could stand at the top of this world at only fifty years old?</p>
<p>Reaching the Saint Realm before one turned one hundred was extremely rare, a fifty year old Third Order Saint was simply impossible!</p>
<p>[Youthful ignorance!] Both Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong pursed their lips, thinking Yang Kai was just a boy who didn’t understand the immensity of Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p>“Why are you smiling like that?” An Ling’er turned and stared at them angrily, “Since he dared to say that, he can certainly achieve it. Just you wait, within thirty years he will definitely become a Third Order Saint.”</p>
<p>“He needs to come out from inside the Holy Tomb first,” Yu Ying frowned slightly, turning a worried look towards An Ling’er, hesitating for a moment before asking, “Ling’er, do you like him that much? Otherwise, how could you speak like that about him?”</p>
<p>An Ling’er’s face immediately went bright red as she hung her head in embarra.s.sment.</p>
<p>“I don’t hate him…” After a moment of silence, An Ling’er whispered softly, “But more than that, I feel guilty towards him. I was the one who involved him in all of this, if I hadn’t taught him the Nine Heavens Divine Skills, he wouldn’t have encountered so much misfortune and he wouldn’t have been forced into the Holy Tomb by all of you. He should have had a better future…”</p>
<p>“That was our decision, it has nothing to do with you,” Yu Ying sighed, a.s.suming full responsibility here.</p>
<p>“Elders, can I ask something of you?” An Ling’er suddenly raised her head and spoke with a deep seriousness.</p>
<p>“Speak,” Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong nodded lightly.</p>
<p>“If… if he can return from the Holy Tomb, can you let him leave? He truly doesn’t want to remain here,” An Ling’er smiled bitterly, “Perhaps for others, becoming Holy Master of the Holy Land is a dream come true, but for him, it is nothing but a shackle. Forcing him to stay here does not have any advantage to him, do you really want to obtain a Holy Master who so wholeheartedly rejects the Holy Land?”</p>
<p>Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong’s brows furrowed, exchanging awkward glances with one another, unable to simply agree to this request, causing them to feel somewhat embarra.s.sed.</p>
<p>An Ling’er continued, “Don’t both of you think he won’t ever come out? That since he died he won’t reveal any of the Holy Land’s secrets? Since that’s the case, what difference is that with complying with this?”</p>
<p>“This… this has to be discussed with Great Elder,” Yu Ying smiled reluctantly; “We can’t take responsibility for such a decision.”</p>
<p>“I can promise you!” A loud voice suddenly came from afar, a streak of light rus.h.i.+ng over and the figure of Great Elder Xu Hui appearing in front of Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>“Great Elder,” Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong greeted hastily.</p>
<p>Xu Hui nodded lightly before turning to look at An Ling’er, “Your Highness Saintess, what you just said, I can promise you!”</p>
<p>“Really?” An Ling’er smiled happily.</p>
<p>“En, Elder Yu and Elder Cheng can testify to it!” Xu Hui said, nodding firmly, “Of course, the premise is that he can come out, and he really does not want to become Holy Master!”</p>
<p>“He should not be willing.”</p>
<p>“That may not be the case…” Xu Hui smiled meaningfully, “Perhaps when he comes out, there will be no need for us to ask and he will take the initiative to inherit the position of Holy Master… no Holy Master candidate who has ever successfully left the Holy Tomb has not pledged their life to the Holy Land.”</p>
<p>Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong eyes flashed slight as smiles appeared on their faces.</p>
<p>Although none of them knew what mysteries were hidden inside the Holy Tomb, what Great Elder Xu Hui said just now was true. Every Holy Master candidate who returned from the Holy Tomb wholeheartedly considered the Holy Land his home and worked tirelessly to support it, even if they had come from a completely different Sect or family.</p>
<p>“Does Great Elder also think he can return?” An Ling’er focused on this point, her eyes s.h.i.+ning brilliantly.</p>
<p>“I hope so…” Xu Hui slowly shook his head, “But I don’t think there’s much of a chance.”</p>
<p>“Just wait; he’ll definitely give all of you a surprise!” An Ling’er gently clenched her fist.</p>
<p>The three Elders all looked at her curiously, not knowing why she was so confident that Yang Kai, who had entered the Holy Tomb for more than four months, could return safely.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Inside the Holy Tomb, Yang Kai let out a low shout and a burst of Spiritual Energy surged up from his Knowledge Sea before slamming into a ma.s.s of energy floating in front of him.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the crisp cracking sound, the last of the Nine Heavens Divine Skills energy auras shattered and all of its profound insights flowed back into Yang Kai’s mind, allowing him to thoroughly comprehend it.</p>
<p>Profound Heavenly Sword, Imprisoning Heaven Chain, Great Heavenly Attraction, Capturing Heaven Net, Heaven Covering Hand, Punis.h.i.+ng Heaven Spear, Grand Heavenly s.h.i.+eld, Flickering Heavenly Shadow, Scarlet Heavenly Arrow…</p>
<p>All of the Nine Heavens Divine Skills flashed across Yang Kai’s mind, now seemingly incomparably familiar. These nine Divine Skills were astounding, far superior to any Martial Skill or Soul Skill Yang Kai had previously encountered.</p>
<p>After such a long period immersed in their study, Yang Kai had mastered the Nine Heavens Divine Skills.</p>
<p>Also, with the World Energy aura in this place being extremely rich, by practicing here for several months, Yang Kai had not just become proficient in the Nine Heavens Divine Skills, but he had also made great progress in his cultivation.</p>
<h2>Martial Peak – Chapter 797, So That’s How It Is</h2>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>Every time he broke through one of the Nine Heavens Divine Skill energy auras, the road in front of Yang Kai became clearer and more s.p.a.cious. After fully comprehending all nine of them and shattering the last energy aura, the entire Mysterious Small World seemed to become brighter, allowing Yang Kai to see the full extent of the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>Releasing his Divine Sense to explore his surroundings, Yang Kai suddenly showed a surprised expression.</p>
<p>The World Energy was so rich that Yang Kai originally thought that this Mysterious Small World was extremely vast, but from what he could tell, it was actually only about as large as a mid-sized town. This was without a doubt the smallest Mysterious Small World Yang Kai had ever seen.</p>
<p>Yang Kai couldn’t fathom where the near inexhaustible supply of World Energy was coming from in such a tiny s.p.a.ce. It was almost as if there was some great source of World Energy which was constantly yet undetectably being poured into this Mysterious Small World.</p>
<p>Throughout the Holy Tomb, Yang Kai sensed all kinds of dangerous Spirit Arrays. These arrays all gave off potent energy fluctuations and radiated a dangerous aura. Once someone accidentally touched one, they would likely suffer a terrifying attack.</p>
<p>Yang Kai could now see through all of this, that was how clear his surroundings had become. It was likely related to the Nine Heavens Divine Skill energy auras he had shattered before, the more of them that were broken, the more traps were revealed.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had shattered all nine energy auras, so naturally he could see all the mysteries hidden inside the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>Not far away, there were several skeletons scattered about, their flesh already completely gone and their possessions all turned to dust.</p>
<p>These skeletons should have been the Holy Master candidates who had entered the Holy Tomb in the past but had failed to pa.s.s the test and died here. From what Yang Kai could tell, these skeletons’ ages varied greatly and were spread out across the entire Holy Tomb, their number not small.</p>
<p>In addition, there were a number of large coffins which placed in different locations around the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>These coffins were all different shapes and colours, but one thing they shared in common was the grim aura they emitted.</p>
<p>Yang Kai quietly condensed his True Qi to guard against any accidents and walked towards the nearest coffin.</p>
<p>Quickly arriving in front of this coffin, Yang Kai found that it was no covered and inside there was a neatly dressed, handsome, middle-aged male corpse.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s brow wrinkled as his eyes were attracted to a bronze ring on the corpses’ left hand.</p>
<p>Standing beside the coffin for a long time, Yang Kai eventually determined that there was no hidden dangers and reached out his hand to touch this ring.</p>
<p>If his guess was right, this ring should be the Holy Master’s Spirit Ring that Xu Hui had mentioned.</p>
<p>All previous Holy Masters would enter the Holy Tomb with the Holy Master Spirit Ring when they felt their time of death was approaching, and the next Holy Master’s first and most important task was to retrieve this ring from the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>This was because this ring was related to the operation of the entire Nine Heavens Holy Land, without it, many important places were inaccessible.</p>
<p>Also, from the condition of this corpse, it was obvious it had died just recently.</p>
<p>It was absolutely the previous generation’s Holy Master!</p>
<p>A Third Order Saint Realm master, only living a short three hundred years before dying of old age, throughout the entire world, such a phenomenon could only be found in Nine Heavens Holy Land.</p>
<p>Observing this man for a moment, Yang Kai couldn’t help frowning slightly, thinking that if he were to become the master of this place, three hundred years later this would be his fate.</p>
<p>A pitiful and lamentable prospect.</p>
<p>After removing the ring from the fingers of the previous generation’s Holy Master, Yang Kai examined it carefully but soon shook his head. He couldn’t recognize what this ring was made of and could only say that it was some kind of special artifact because inside the ring there some vague energy fluctuations which even after thousands of years did not seem likely to dissipate.</p>
<p>These energy fluctuations were odd and seemed to follow some inexplicable law Yang Kai couldn’t quite make sense of.</p>
<p>As he was staring at it, Yang Kai suddenly felt a powerful suction force emerge from the ring. It was as if a big invisible hand had appeared, broke through s.p.a.ce, and dove straight into the depths of Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea, causing his Soul to shudder slightly.</p>
<p>“Great Heavenly Attraction!” Yang Kai paled, instantly recognizing the burst of energy from the Spirit Ring as one of the Nine Heavens Divine Skills and quickly trying to resist, but before he could even blink, a dim light flashed and he felt something disappear from his Knowledge Sea.</p>
<p>The next moment, Yang Kai felt a subtle connection between himself and the Holy Master Spirit Ring.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face became gloomy as he stood there, staring at the Holy Master Spirit Ring in his hand, wis.h.i.+ng he could immediately destroy it.</p>
<p>Great Heavenly Attraction could forcefully remove another’s Soul brand, allowing one to control it. Yang Kai had initially caught An Ling’er off guard and used this trick to obtain her Soul brand. With it, Yang Kai gained control over whether An Ling’er lived or died and could even spy on the changes in her mood.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, this Holy Master Spirit Ring had used the Great Heavenly Attraction to obtain Yang Kai’s Soul brand.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this was something the previous generation’s Holy Master had secretly arranged.</p>
<p>A move made by a Third Order Saint was not something Yang Kai could resist or dispel.</p>
<p>This also meant that if Yang Kai were to throw away this ring, he would also be throwing away his Soul brand. Once it was obtained by an enemy, it would be equivalent to seizing control of Yang Kai’s life.</p>
<p>Yang Kai couldn’t help cursing repeatedly. Originally he planned on taking this Holy Master Spirit Ring and use it as a bargaining chip to obtain his freedom from Xu Hui, but now, this Holy Master Spirit Ring was his and absolutely couldn’t be handed over to someone else.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s mood suddenly became awful.</p>
<p>Before Yang Kai could compose himself though, from the body of the previous generation Holy Master in the coffin, a huge wave of energy rushed out.</p>
<p>At the same time, from all the coffins inside the Holy Tomb, similar waves of energy burst forth and rushed towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>It was as if they were being drawn towards Yang Kai somehow.</p>
<p>In an instant, Yang Kai felt his Knowledge Sea’s defenses torn apart and these ma.s.ses of energy pour into his head, causing his consciousness to become chaotic.</p>
<p>Yang Kai went pale and didn’t dare hesitate, quickly sitting down cross legged and immersing his consciousness into his Knowledge Sea.</p>
<p>In his Soul Avatar form, Yang Kai swiftly examined his Knowledge Sea and found that it was now turbulent and stormy. It seemed that his Knowledge Sea had automatically responded to this invasion by counterattacking.</p>
<p>The sea of flames roared as waves crashed back and forth, battering these invaders which seemed to instinctively fear Yang Kai’s Conflagrated Knowledge Sea and were fleeing in all directions.</p>
<p>While they were rus.h.i.+ng about, these invaders were releasing invisible spiritual energy fluctuations towards Yang Kai’s Soul Avatar.</p>
<p>Yang Kai immediately wore a suspicious expression, his eyes narrowing as he stared at the energy ma.s.ses which had rushed into his Knowledge Sea, his mind gradually stabilizes.</p>
<p>The roaring sea water and flames also calmed down.</p>
<p>From what Yang Kai could see, these energy ma.s.ses were actually the wills of the old Nine Heavens Holy Land Holy Masters. Strictly speaking, they were remnant Souls.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai couldn’t sense any conscious thought from these Soul remnants; they seemed to only be autonomously completing some final task their previous owners had set at their time of death.</p>
<p>These energy ma.s.ses didn’t have any hostile intent and were simply releasing continuous bursts of Spiritual Energy towards Yang Kai’s Soul Avatar, seemingly trying to convey something.</p>
<p>Yang Kai hesitated for a moment before taking the initiative to lower his Soul’s defences and accepting whatever it was that these Soul remnants were trying to instill into him.</p>
<p>After a while, Yang Kai’s expression became strange.</p>
<p>Unlike what he expected, these Soul remnants weren’t trying to teach him some kind of Secret Art or Martial Skill, but rather were trying to apply some kind of brainwas.h.i.+ng to him.</p>
<p>In an instant, Yang Kai’s views towards Nine Heavens Holy Land underwent some subtle changes, suddenly feeling like staying here wouldn’t be so bad. By becoming Holy Master he would not only gain great wealth and status, he would be able to command thousands of disciples and arrive at the peak of Martial Dao in the shortest time. It was far better than trying hard on his own.</p>
<p>Such thoughts caused Yang Kai’s will to soften and a sense of laziness to take over. He also felt that the remnant Souls of the past Holy Masters were warm and friendly and that he wanted to hear more of their teachings.</p>
<p>However, a sense of deep repulsion soon emerged from the depth of his soul. His heart clenching from those thoughts and Yang Kai quickly cut off the connection of his Soul Avatar with them. He hastily expelled all these misleading thoughts, turning a cold eye to the Soul remnants floating around him.</p>
<p>“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai sneered, his eyes flas.h.i.+ng a cold light.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had always been curious about why the Holy Masters brought back by the Saintesses would be so willing to join the Holy Land, even if it meant their lives would be greatly shortened. It turns out they were indoctrinated by these Soul remnants inside the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>If not for his Soul being far stronger than normal, it was likely Yang Kai would have followed in these people’s footsteps and been completely brainwashed within an hour or two.</p>
<p>The Spiritual Energy bursts emanating from the Soul remnants of these previous Holy Masters had a strong enticement to them. Under their influence, anyone would quickly feel a sense of connection and affection towards Nine Heavens Holy Land, regarding it as their own home and a place they needed to protect.</p>
<p>Even the strongest of the previous Holy Master candidates who entered the Holy Tomb and pa.s.sed its test were merely First Order Transcendents, so their Souls weren’t very strong. But Yang Kai was different, his cultivation was far stronger and his Spiritual Energy was even stronger than that, giving him a certain ability to resist this kind of spiritual attack.</p>
<p>Additionally, he had never wanted to become Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land, allowing him to quickly come to his senses.</p>
<p>Understanding all of this, Yang Kai suddenly became fearless. If it was some other kind of restriction or technique, he might be worried, but the biggest mistake the remnant Souls of these previous Holy Masters was diving into his Knowledge Sea.</p>
<p>In this place, only he was the master!</p>
<p>Trying to communicate with the remnant Souls, Yang Kai didn’t receive any response. These previous Holy Masters had died long ago and these remnant Souls had simply been preserved in this place via some strange method, but none of their consciousness remained, they simply carried out this one task mechanically.</p>
<p>The mental attacks of these Soul remnants continued uninterrupted, using all kinds of appeas.e.m.e.nt and inducement, trying to shake Yang Kai’s Soul, causing him to gradually grow impatient. After failing to communicate with them, Yang Kai decided to put an end to this once and for all and opened the Demon Eye of Annihilation floating over his Knowledge Sea.</p>
<p>The golden eye stared down at these Soul remnants like a majestic king before shooting out a beam of golden light.</p>
<p>With a great whoosh, all the remnant Souls of these once powerful Third Order Saints were instantly purified.</p>
<h2>Inside the Holy Tomb, Yang Kai spent a few days meditating as he absorbed the essence of the Nine Heavens Holy Land’s previous Holy Masters’ remnant Souls.</h2>
<p>His harvest was unimaginably huge!</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai’s cultivation realm hadn’t changed at all, because he a.s.similated the sentiments and insights of so many Third Order Saint Realm masters, his understanding of his future path had become incomparably clear.</p>
<p>As long as his physique and True Qi could keep up, his cultivation would be able to advance without any worries. It could be said that before becoming a Third Order Saint, he would not encounter any bottlenecks when trying to break through.</p>
<p>Such fortune was something all cultivators could only dreams of.</p>
<p>The reason why it was so difficult to break through to higher realms was that every time one reached a critical point, they would encounter bottlenecks. If they failed to spy on the mysteries of the next realm, they would forever be unable to break through.</p>
<p>All cultivators encountered bottlenecks along their path, preventing them from advancing further. Even those favoured Sons of Heaven with incredible apt.i.tude who rapidly progressed and caused the world to marvel at their talent when they were young, would often times later in life encounter insurmountable bottlenecks and find themselves unable to advance any further.</p>
<p>If they encountered some kind of opportunity or if their luck was good enough to break through that bottleneck though, their strength would increase sharply.</p>
<p>So, bottlenecks were something that every cultivator worried about, and no matter who it was, they would encounter at least some in their pursuit of the Martial Dao.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had also encountered several bottlenecks in the past and only after overcoming several life and death situations had he managed to surmount them.</p>
<p>But from now on, he wouldn’t have to worry about this problem. Before becoming a Third Order Saint, his cultivation path would be smooth.</p>
<p>Letting out a gentle breath, Yang Kai stood up and felt that his entire world had undergone some subtle changes, a sense of connection and understanding permeating his soul, giving him a wondrous and mysterious feeling.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from the coffin in front of him, Yang Kai felt some faint energy fluctuations, and after inspecting this anomaly for a moment, a smile appeared on his face.</p>
<p>Upon direction a thread of his Divine Sense towards the source of the energy fluctuations, a stream of light burst forth from the coffin and flew straight towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai stuck out his hand and the stream of light landed on his palm; examining it, it turned out to be a small silver leaf.</p>
<p>The veins on this leaf were distinct and lifelike, as if it had just been plucked from a tree, but this seemingly simple and delicate leaf was actually radiating a shocking aura!</p>
<p>Saint Grade Top-Rank artifact!</p>
<p>Xu Hui and the other Elders had said that the artifact used by the previous Holy Master was of this grade, and that there weren’t many like it throughout the entire world.</p>
<p>This Silver Leaf artifact bore the Soul mark of the previous generation Holy Master, but since Yang Kai had purified all the remnant Souls of the previous Holy Masters with his Demon Eye of Annihilation and absorbed their essence, naturally he could control their leftover Soul marks.</p>
<p>In other words, if there were any artifacts left in any of these coffins, Yang Kai could easily obtain them without worrying about any kind of backlash.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had never seen an artifact like this one, but the variety of artifacts throughout the world were many and they came in all shapes and sizes. This Silver Leaf obviously possessed incredible power but since he had not refined it, Yang Kai couldn’t be clear about its use, so for now he simply stored it into his Black Book s.p.a.ce.</p>
<p>Avoiding the various arrays and barriers inside the Holy Tomb, Yang Kai eagerly walked towards the second coffin.</p>
<p>He intended to sweep this place clean!</p>
<p>Making his way around, Yang Kai reaped a great harvest once again. These coffins all belonged to previous Holy Masters who were top level powerhouses, so naturally the artifacts they used were outstanding as well.</p>
<p>Almost every coffin had at least one Saint Grade artifact, most of them Mid-Rank with a small number only Low-Rank. Unfortunately, the only Top-Rank Yang Kai obtained was the Silver Leaf, showing just how rare such powerful artifacts were.</p>
<p>Although these artifacts were all not bad, Yang Kai actually wasn’t that interested in them. These swords, halberds, and spears weren’t suitable for him to use as he had never studied any weapon techniques, he was more accustomed to using his own hands and feet when it came to fighting.</p>
<p>The only item which drew Yang Kai’s attention was a dark red Armour Artifact. This armour was light yet dazzling and had a beautiful design. It could absolutely withstand the attacks of a lower level Saint Realm masters.</p>
<p>This armour was designed for a woman. Yang Kai was certain of this as he had taken it off a female corpse.</p>
<p>The coffin where he had found this armour was different from the others. There were two skeletons lying inside of it, one of them a previous Holy Master and the other one of the Saintesses from that generation. The two of them were embracing one another, even in death, causing even Yang Kai to let out a faint sigh.</p>
<p>This Armour artifact would actually make a good gift, whether it was for Su Yan or Xia Ning Chang.</p>
<p>Thinking about it for a moment, Yang Kai decided to collect it as well.</p>
<p>Soon, Yang Kai stopped in front of the last coffin, but what made him surprised was that there was no trace of any artifacts inside, and unlike all the others, this coffin was actually sealed shut and encased in multiple layers of barriers. These barriers had obviously been in place for many, many years and were thus showing some signs of degradation.</p>
<p>Also, for some unknown reason, when Yang Kai stood in front of this coffin, he felt the blood stir and his heartbeat become stronger. It was as if something inside the coffin was calling out to his blood.</p>
<p>After staring for a while with a frown upon his face, Yang Kai slowly shook his head. Because of the barriers, he couldn’t effectively investigate the inside of the coffin to figure out what was happening.</p>
<p>However, only this coffin was sealed, making it obvious that this particular Holy Master didn’t want others to open it and investigate the secrets hidden inside.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for his strange induction, Yang Kai also would have simply let things be as he didn’t sense any artifacts inside, but now he couldn’t bring himself to simply ignore it.</p>
<p>Even though he tried, Yang Kai couldn’t suppress his curiosity.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a moment, Yang Kai’s expression became firm and he lifted his hand and punched towards the coffin, sending out a burst of True Qi.</p>
<p>The barrier set up by a Third Order Saint, in theory, would be impossible for Yang Kai to break, but this Holy Master had died countless years ago so the barrier was now nowhere near its peak strength.</p>
<p>It took Yang Kai less than half an hour to break through all the barriers.</p>
<p>As the last rays of light faded, the final barrier sealing the coffin lost its effect. Yang Kai took a deep breath, reached out and unsealed it.</p>
<p>After a putrid gas leaked out, the skeleton that appeared before Yang Kai’s eyes causing him a great deal of shock.</p>
<p>This skeleton was severely damaged, with broken bones and fractures all over. From what Yang Kai could tell, over eighty percent of this skeleton’s bones had some kind of injury on them.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was astonished!</p>
<p>Every Holy Master lying here was a peak Third Order Saint, and this one was no exception. When one reached such a realm, their flesh and bones would become incredibly tough and very few attacks could damage them.</p>
<p>However, the scene in front of Yang Kai showed that this Holy Master had fought with a powerful enemy before he died and regardless of whether he won or lost, had actually taken a severe beating. The reason why this master had died was definitely related to these injuries!</p>
<p>What kind of person could kill a peak Third Order Saint?</p>
<p>Somewhat absent minded, Yang Kai’s gaze drifted over the broken skeleton and eventually landed on a jet black bottle.</p>
<p>Before he died, this Holy Master had folded his hands and tightly held this black bottle to his chest. This bottle also had several restrictions on it and was clearly trying to seal something inside.</p>
<p>A terrifying energy pulsed from this bottle, immediately making Yang Kai feel like his whole body was throbbing.</p>
<p><em>Kacha…</em></p>
<p>A crisp sound rang out suddenly. It seemed like when Yang Kai broke the barrier around the coffin, he had caused the contents of the bottle to become unstable and at this moment it was violently rampaging, trying to break free of its prison.</p>
<p>The black bottle couldn’t bear such strain and within moments countless cracks appeared on its surface while the light from the seals also began to fade.</p>
<p>Yang Kai stood by and watch, not making any attempt to interfere. He faintly felt that whatever was inside the bottle had something to do with him.</p>
<p>Together with the scene in front of him, he even had some guesses as to what was happening.</p>
<p><em>Kacha…</em></p>
<p>With a crack, the black bottle shattered and a brilliant golden light burst forth, brightly illuminating the entire Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>The various barriers and Spirit Arrays all over the Holy Tomb were smashed by this golden light and ceased to function.</p>
<p>A terrifying Demonic Qi, centered on the golden light, erupted into the surroundings, sending all the scattered coffins hurtling through the air before causing them to explode, turning all the skeletons of the previous Holy Masters into dust.</p>
<p>Yang Kai stared intently at the golden light, his expression fluctuating as he muttered under his breath, “Demon G.o.d Golden Blood?”</p>
<p>From the golden light Yang Kai could smell a strong b.l.o.o.d.y scent; there was no doubt this was a drop of blood. Moreover, this drop of blood was like the purest molten gold. It exuded a rich Demonic aura that made even Yang Kai fearful. To actually be grasped by a deceased Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land, besides being a drop of Demon G.o.d Golden Blood, Yang Kai couldn’t think of any other possibilities!</p>
<p>Why was there a drop of Demon G.o.d Golden Blood here thought? What kind of relations.h.i.+p was there between his Holy Master and the legendary Great Demon G.o.d?</p>
<p>Before Yang Kai could organize his thoughts though, the drop of Demon G.o.d Golden Blood floating in front of him, as if having discovered its target, suddenly disappeared, leaving behind a golden afterimage and it rushed directly towards Yang Kai’s brow, entering his forehead and disappearing before he could react.</p>
<p>In the next moment, Yang Kai’s expression twisted.</p>
<p>The golden blood in his veins seemed to have been hyper-stimulated and was on the rampaging wildly. This quickly spread to his meridians and physique, causing multiple explosions all over his body. Within a few breaths, Yang Kai was covered in wounds and his whole body felt as if it was on fire, causing him unbearable pain.</p>
<p>A dazzling golden light shrouded Yang Kai. Unable to bear the pain, Yang Kai lifted his head and roared as this Mysterious Small World was filled with a thick b.l.o.o.d.y aura, transforming it into a strange red and golden s.p.a.ce.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s Unyielding Golden Skeleton squirmed and creaked as the Demonic Qi stored inside it burst forth and transformed into Demon Crests covering his skin, disappearing into his physique in the next instant.</p>
<p>The red and gold Mysterious Small World was suddenly submerged in a thick darkness without a single trace of light.</p>
<p>Inside this darkness, Yang Kai grit his teeth and trembled, his skin filled with cracks as red blood oozed out onto the ground.</p>
<p>However, in front of his eyes, a series of illusory scenes began unfolding, depicting an earth-shattering battle.</p>
<h2>Yang Kai didn’t open his eyes nor did he use his senses to try to perceive anything, yet the scenes of this battle still vividly appeared in his consciousness.</h2>
<p>Soon, Yang Kai found himself drawn in by this battle, even forgetting the extreme pain he was experiencing, all his attention focused on it.</p>
<p>The battle was between two extremely powerful masters, every move they made containing unimaginable power. It was as if these two really had the power to destroy the world.</p>
<p>One of them was a man who gave off a shocking Demonic Qi while the other was a temperate middle-aged man.</p>
<p>The appearance of the former was familiar to Yang Kai, and after thinking about it for a moment, his eyes lit up and immediately understood who this master surrounded by Demonic Qi was.</p>
<p>The Great Demon G.o.d!</p>
<p>This was the Great Demon G.o.d!</p>
<p>Yang Kai had seen the statue of the Great Demon G.o.d back in the Mysterious Small World where the Ancient Demon Clan lived; it was very similar to the person in front of him, practically identical.</p>
<p>The Great Demon G.o.d was a legendary existence; during his time, no one was his opponent, the recognized first master under Heaven! Under his command, the Demon Race reigned supreme and even the Human Race with its superior population had to bow and give way.</p>
<p>Since then, no leader of the Demon Race dared to use the t.i.tle Demon G.o.d, all of them instead calling themselves Demon Commander, such was the extent of their wors.h.i.+p and respect towards the Great Demon G.o.d.</p>
<p>It was said that there was once a Demon Commander who in his arrogance named himself Demon G.o.d, and as a result, within a few days, was besieged and killed by his own subordinates.</p>
<p>From this it was obvious just how much influence and prestige the Great Demon G.o.d still had in the Demon Race even after his fall.</p>
<p>However, the scene in front of Yang Kai was probably from before the Great Demon G.o.d matured and reached that peak. Even so, the masters who could fight one on one with him were still extremely rare.</p>
<p>This middle-aged man was one such person!</p>
<p>He was that era’s Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land! The one whose body Yang Kai had discovered broken and shattered within the sealed coffin.</p>
<p>Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling somewhat agitated. He didn’t know why he could see this battle which had occurred countless years ago, but he faintly felt it was related to the drop of Demon G.o.d Blood. Perhaps the Demon G.o.d’s Golden Blood carried with it some memories of the Great Demon G.o.d.</p>
<p>The Great Demon G.o.d and the Holy Master of the time were both Third Order Saints, it was truly a showdown between peak level masters.</p>
<p>What lead to this battle, Yang Kai didn’t know, by the time he began observing the two masters were already engaged in an intense struggle, both of them holding nothing back.</p>
<p>From the ground to the sky, the sky to the Starry Sky, and then back to the ground from Starry Sky, the scene changed rapidly as the two fought. Their strength seemed even, neither one of them gaining any advantage over the other.</p>
<p>The more Yang Kai watched, the more enthralled he became, unable to think of anything else.</p>
<p>Being able to witness such a high level battle had great benefits to his growth. The Juniors of great forces would often be taken by their Seniors to observe the battles of high-level cultivators so they could witness what true combat looked like, hopefully allowing them to gain some form of inspiration or insight in the process.</p>
<p>It could be said that the scene in front of Yang Kai was a rare opportunity!</p>
<p>The methods these two men used in their battle caused Yang Kai to sink into contemplation while fixedly observing them.</p>
<p>After an unknown amount of time pa.s.sed, the stalemate between the two men was gradually broken.</p>
<p>Whether the Holy Master made some slight mistake or he couldn’t see a path to victory and his momentum faded, he suddenly found himself at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The Great Demon G.o.d on the other hand was like a raging beast, taking this opportunity to ruthlessly suppress his opponent.</p>
<p>As Yang Kai watched this battle with great relish, the picture in front of him suddenly changed again. Probably because so much time had pa.s.sed, the memories stored in the Demon G.o.d’s Golden Blood weren’t very coherent.</p>
<p>When the vision stabilized again, Yang Kai saw that the battle had already been decided. That generation’s Holy Master coughed up a large amount of blood and his face went pale, his figure quickly transforming into a streak of light as he fled from the Great Demon G.o.d.</p>
<p>Before leaving though, he took with him a drop of the blood from the Great Demon G.o.d.</p>
<p>The Great Demon G.o.d just stood in place, staring coldly and arrogantly towards the retreating figure, not showing any intention to pursue, a moment later his figure also fading away.</p>
<p>The scene in his mind was then cut off…</p>
<p>Yang Kai let out a long breath and slowly calmed his racing heart.</p>
<p>He had never expected he would one day witness the Great Demon G.o.d in such a way. Since coming to Tong Xuan Realm, he had heard many legends about this man from many different people and knew that he was somehow inextricably linked with himself.</p>
<p>The Unyielding Golden Skeleton was from the Great Demon G.o.d’s body and the Demon Eye of Annihilation was once his eyes, even the Wordless Black Book had been created by him. Unfortunately so many years had pa.s.sed since the Great Demon G.o.d’s time so Yang Kai never had a chance to witness his true strength.</p>
<p>However, now he had.</p>
<p>The inheritance left behind by the Great Demon G.o.d had been of great help to Yang Kai’s growth, but Yang Kai felt that he would not be bound by the Great Demon G.o.d’s path. On the contrary, Yang Kai was convinced that he could one day exceed the Great Demon G.o.d and arrive at a height far surpa.s.sing his past achievements.</p>
<p>Only by doing so could he live up to inheritance he received and also prove that all he had obtained was not simply given to him by the Great Demon G.o.d.</p>
<p>After watching this great battle, Yang Kai finally understood what had happened to the Holy Master inside this last coffin.</p>
<p>The wounds this Holy Master’s bones suffered should have been caused by the Great Demon G.o.d. After that battle, the former had returned to the Holy Land and soon after pa.s.sed away. The reason he had left behind a drop of Demon G.o.d Golden Blood was likely because he couldn’t accept this outcome.</p>
<p>This series of coincidences led to Yang Kai accidentally obtaining this drop of Demon G.o.d Golden Blood and being able to observe such a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Inside the Holy Tomb, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes. The darkness that had permeated this s.p.a.ce had faded and the original gloomy atmosphere had been restored.</p>
<p>Examining himself, Yang Kai was slightly surprised.</p>
<p>Although he had suffered numerous injuries all over his body, with his powerful restorative abilities, such wounds were irrelevant. What he cared about though was that because he had absorbed a drop of Demon G.o.d Golden Blood, the blood flowing through his veins had undergone significant changes.</p>
<p>The amount of golden blood Yang Kai possessed increased noticeably and the Demonic Qi which filled his Unyielding Golden Skeleton had become even more potent.</p>
<p>Additionally, he had even comprehended one of the Great Demon G.o.d’s Divine Abilities!</p>
<p>Soul Fission!</p>
<p>By using one’s own Soul brand as a base and filling it with a ma.s.sive amount of Spiritual Energy, one could nourish it using special methods to grow a second Soul. This second Soul could then be split from one’s body and move independently, essentially a Soul Clone.</p>
<p>The strongest of Soul Clones could display over eighty percent of all of its original’s abilities.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, remembering the Soul Clone of Demon General Meng Ge who he met in his previous world.</p>
<p>Inside the Evil Cavern, Yang Kai, without knowing anything, had used the Devil Sealing Chain to kill Meng Ge’s Soul Clone, and was subsequently threatened by the Demon General.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until coming to Tong Xuan Realm that Yang Kai understood just what kind of powerhouse Meng Ge was.</p>
<p>At that time, Meng Ge should have been using this Soul Fission Divine Ability and somehow sent his Soul Clone to the Evil Cavern. However, compared to the Great Demon G.o.d’s Soul Fission Divine Ability Yang Kai had just obtained, there was a big gap in performance.</p>
<p>Simply put, Meng Ge’s Soul Clone was far too weak.</p>
<p>Yang Kai guessed that Meng Ge had discovered some ancient books left behind by the Great Demon G.o.d and used them to replicate this Divine Ability, but it had turned out far inferior to the original.</p>
<p>Cultivating Soul Fission had many advantages. Once one’s Soul Clone was formed, one would have two Souls inside their Knowledge Sea. Having two Souls cultivating at once meant the growth of one’s Spiritual Energy would be twice as fast.</p>
<p>Of course, the price one had to pay in order to cultivate a second Soul was ma.s.sive! Cultivating Soul Fission required a huge amount of Spiritual Energy.</p>
<p>However, for Yang Kai, this was not a problem. With the Six Coloured Soul Warming Lotus constantly nouris.h.i.+ng his Soul, his Spiritual Energy could be recovered far more rapidly than others.</p>
<p>Sweeping his eyes around his surroundings, Yang Kai discovered that the Holy Tomb was now a complete mess. It seemed like because of his entry this time, this Mysterious Small World had been all but destroyed.</p>
<p>From now on, any Holy Master candidate who came here would likely not be able to gain any benefits, nor would they receive any brainwas.h.i.+ng from their predecessors.</p>
<p>Even Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling a bit awkward. Although he had been forced to enter this place by Xu Hui and the others, the Holy Tomb was also one of the pillars of Nine Heavens Holy Land’s foundation. If the Elders and Protectors of Nine Heavens Holy Land were to learn that he had ruined this place, they definitely wouldn’t let him off easily.</p>
<p>At the very least, they would force him to accept the position of Holy Master to take responsibility.</p>
<p>On top of that, the Holy Master Spirit Ring had absorbed Yang Kai’s Soul brand.</p>
<p>Yang Kai suddenly felt things have become complicated and unless he was willing to go to war with Nine Heavens Holy Land, the situation had become set.</p>
<p>Letting out an exasperated sigh, Yang Kai didn’t rush to leave the Holy Tomb and instead began cultivating the Great Demon G.o.d’s Soul Fission.</p>
<p>Inside his Knowledge Sea, Yang Kai condensed a Soul brand and then using some special methods began injecting his Spiritual Energy into this brand, building and nouris.h.i.+ng his Soul Clone.</p>
<p>The Spiritual Energy required for this process was immense and even with the help of the Six Coloured Soul Warming Lotus Yang Kai couldn’t keep up with the consumption. Fortunately, there were many pills inside the Black Book s.p.a.ce, including those for restoring Spiritual Energy.</p>
<p>Yang Kai also had a large amount of Myriad Drug Liquid left so he wasn’t worried about his Spiritual Energy running dry.</p>
<p>Days flew by.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had no intention of quickly leaving the Holy Tomb, hoping that with the pa.s.sage of time, he could fade from the memories of Xu Hui and the other Nine Heavens Elders. And so he continued to cultivate.</p>
<p>Only when he had reached the minor accomplishment stage of the Soul Fission Divine Ability did Yang Kai decided to stop.</p>
<p>From now on he didn’t need to actively cultivate this Divine Ability as his second Soul would now continue to strengthen itself all on its own. Unfortunately, until it reached full maturity it would not have its own consciousness and could not provide him with any a.s.sistance. Once it reached maturity, Yang Kai would also need to find a suitable container to implant it into in order to create a true Soul Clone.</p>
<p>Right now, his Soul Clone lacked the ability to think for itself and could only be manipulated directly by Yang Kai. But sending it into places that were inconvenient or dangerous for him to go might prove useful at some point!</p>
<p>Slowly standing up, Yang Kai looked around for the Holy Tomb’s exit.</p>
<h2>Moments later, Yang Kai sensed a faint energy fluctuation and moved towards it, soon arriving in front of a stone wall. After pouring his True Qi into this wall, a Void Corridor appeared in front of him and he stopped through, returning to the outside world once more.</h2>
<p>Yang Kai arrived in front of the same blue stone entrance to Nine Heavens Holy Land’s Holy Tomb he had entered from.</p>
<p>As soon as he appeared, Yang Kai immediately concealed his aura and quietly probed his surroundings.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure how long he had stayed inside the Holy Tomb but he knew it wasn’t a short amount of time. Since there wasn’t anyone around anymore, obviously Xu Hui and the others had left long ago.</p>
<p>This was the perfect time for him to sneak away.</p>
<p>As long as he left Nine Heavens Holy Land, he would be like a bird returning to the sky, a fish swimming through the sea. It would be incredibly hard for Xu Hui and the others to bring him back once more.</p>
<p>However, after carefully examining the situation around him, Yang Kai’s expression became somewhat strange.</p>
<p>The entire Nine Heavens Holy Land was in a state of confusion. It seemed like a big battle had just occurred as traces of destruction could be found all around. There were many houses and buildings among the Nine Peaks that had broken walls or collapsed roofs.</p>
<p>Yang Kai also smelled a faint scent of blood in the air and cries of pain reached rang in his ears.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Yang Kai sensed a familiar life aura. This person seemed to have noticed his presence causing their aura to fluctuate wildly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai turned his head just in time to see An Ling’er.</p>
<p>This Saintess, a symbol of purity and n.o.bility, currently had a blue cloth wrapped around her head and her white dress was covered in dust and blood, clearly she had just been involved in a fight.</p>
<p>When she saw Yang Kai, a look of joy and disbelief filled An Ling’er’s beautiful face as she stood there dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Before she could open her mouth to speak though, An Ling’er saw Yang Kai’s figure flicker and in the next moment appear in front of her. Her mouth was covered and her movements sealed, causing her to be unable to resist as Yang Kai quickly brought her to relatively secluded pavilion a short distance away.</p>
<p>“I’m letting you go now, don’t shout!” Yang Kai whispered.</p>
<p>A hint of panic flashed across An Ling’er’s pretty eyes before she quickly nodded.</p>
<p>Yang Kai released her and then quickly backed away, lest she misunderstand his actions as an attempt to silence her.</p>
<p>“You came out?” An Ling’er glanced around nervously before whispering.</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently nodded, “Just now.”</p>
<p>“You really came out!” An Ling’er breathed out a sigh of relief, a light smile appearing on her face. She had been worried about Yang Kai this entire time so seeing him now, safe and sound, it was like a large stone had been lifted off her heart, causing her to relax.</p>
<p>Yang Kai being forced into the Holy Tomb was something An Ling’er always felt she carried a large responsibility for. During this time, she had always been blaming herself to the point where it had affected her health.</p>
<p>Now though she could finally feel at ease.</p>
<p>“It’s good that you’ve come out!” An Ling’er gently patted her chest, “Since you’ve come out, you should quickly leave before Great Elder or any of the others find you.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes flashed as he stared towards An Ling’er and asked, “Are you willing to let me just leave?”</p>
<p>“En,” An Ling’er revealed a forced smile, “I know you don’t want to be here, trying to force you to stay would only make you hate me. Since that’s the case, I might as well just let you go.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai expression softened and a hint of grat.i.tude appeared on his face.</p>
<p>“What are you staring at me like that for? If you’re discovered you won’t be able to get away!” An Ling’er frowned.</p>
<p>“I was just thinking you look much more attractive now!” Yang Kai flattered shamelessly.</p>
<p>An Ling’er’s face blushed bright red as she angrily spat, “Don’t try to sweet talk me now, I’ve known you’re not a good thing since long ago. Don’t think you can win my favour after all this time.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai laughed dumbly before putting on a serious face and cupping his fists said, “This is goodbye then, I hope there’s a chance for us to meet in the future.”</p>
<p>“En, go quickly. Head south, Great Elder and the others are currently north of this place,” An Ling’er urged.</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded lightly, quickly found his bearings and then quietly flew off towards the south.</p>
<p>Shortly after Yang Kai’s departure, a figure emerged from the shadows and walked towards An Ling’er.</p>
<p>“Ah, Elder Yu Ying!” An Ling’er was startled and called out unconsciously.</p>
<p>Yu Ying stared in the direction Yang Kai disappeared for a while before letting out a sigh and faintly asking, “Are you really willing to just let him go like that?”</p>
<p>“You saw?” An Ling’er’s expression became somewhat awkward. She didn’t know when Yu Ying had arrived behind her but from the latter’s tone of voice it obvious she had seen and heard everything just now.</p>
<p>“I only saw him hurriedly leave, without any hesitation.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing here that would cause him to hesitate,” An Ling’er said with a forced smile.</p>
<p>“What about you? You exhausted yourself worrying about him, spent so much time together with him, shared so many hards.h.i.+ps together with him, even admired and respected him. Aren’t the two of you at least more than friends?” Yu Ying looked faintly towards An Ling’er.</p>
<p>An Ling’er shook her head gently, “While he is certainly somewhat hateful, I don’t think I’m worthy to be joined together with him. Moreover, I truly don’t think of him in that way, just being friends with him is probably for the best. En, undeniably, following beside him I felt a deep sense of security, making me mistakenly feel like I was the younger one, and I would always be protected by him… but with the current position the Holy Land is in, I don’t think it’s right to implicate him. Elder Yu Ying, can you not mention this to Great Elder? We might as well just say he died here.”</p>
<p>Yu Ying’s brow furrowed deeply, seemingly weighing the decision.</p>
<p>An Ling’er quickly hugged Yu Ying’s arm, acting the part of a spoiled child.</p>
<p>Faced with this combination of soft and hard sell tactics, Yu Ying could only smile bitterly and rub her forehead, “Alright, alright… Nothing happened here and I didn’t see anything… I won’t say a word about this to anyone. Ling’er, you’ve exhausted yourself these past few days, you should quickly go back and have a rest. We Elders will take care of the problems outside, you don’t need to worry about them. All the Holy Land’s hopes now can only be pinned on you. You must diligently cultivate the Saintess’ Secret Arts for now. If the Holy Land can survive this crisis, it will be up to you to train a new generation of Saintesses.”</p>
<p>Seeing Yu Ying agree to her request, An Ling’er immediately became joyful.</p>
<p>However, when the two of them remembered the Holy Land’s precarious situation, their eyes noticeably dimmed. Whether the Holy Land could survive the current catastrophe or what the future held, neither of them could say.</p>
<p>Perhaps, within a short time, everyone here would die. If not for this cruel realty, it would have been impossible for Yu Ying to so easily agree to An Ling’er’s request.</p>
<p>“Elder Yu Ying is apparently quite amenable,” A light voice suddenly reverberated throughout the pavilion, making it impossible to determine exactly where the person speaking actually was.</p>
<p>Yu Ying’s beautiful face paled as she quickly condensed her True Qi, shouting aggressively, “Who goes there!”</p>
<p>As soon as these words left Yu Ying’s lips, a figure emerged a few steps away from her, a somewhat teasing smile upon his face.</p>
<p>“Flickering Heavenly Shadow?” An Ling’er cried out, immediately recognizing this Nine Heavens Divine Skill. This was a very profound movement skill that was equally useful for concealing one’s presence or escaping from an enemy.</p>
<p>Recovering from her shock, An Ling’er stared at Yang Kai who had suddenly returned and couldn’t help asking, “Why didn’t you leave?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders before seemingly unintentionally shooting a glance towards Yu Ying.</p>
<p>When he had left just now, he noticed that this woman was hiding behind An Ling’er, so in order to insure news of his re-appearance was not leaked, he had concealed himself in order to monitor these two. By doing so though, he had overheard the conversation between the two women and suddenly felt that simply disappearing on his own would leave a sour taste in his mouth.</p>
<p>“How did you deceive my Divine Sense? I clearly noticed that you had already traveled far away, just when did you come back?” Yu Ying stared at Yang Kai, a look of incredible disbelief spread across her face.</p>
<p>She was a genuine First Order Saint, but Yang Kai was still able to silently approach this close to her without her noticing. That meant that if Yang Kai had harboured any hostile intent towards her, it was quite possible she would be a corpse right now.</p>
<p>Immediately realizing this, Yu Ying’s tender body s.h.i.+vered as a cold sweat dripped down her back, suddenly discovering that this future Holy Master was somewhat beyond her ability to understand or control.</p>
<p>“No need to be so nervous, it’s not like I’m going to eat you,” Yang Kai grinned, intentionally not answering Yu Ying’s question, his expression then quickly becoming serious as he asked, “On the other hand, I’m somewhat curious about what you two were just discussing. What exactly happened to your Nine Heavens Holy Land while I was gone?”</p>
<p>An Ling’er opened her mouth to explain but before she could get a single word out, Yu Ying quickly cut her off, “Does that have anything to do with you? Since you’re unwilling to inherit the position of Holy Master, is there any point in asking about that?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai knit his brow and felt somewhat confused.</p>
<p>The last time he had seen her, this beautiful woman had spoken and acted very respectfully towards him, yet this time it was as if she had encountered an enemy and was harshly rejecting him.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had no intention of haggling over the issue with her though so he just shrugged his shoulders and nodded, “If you don’t want to say that’s fine too, I don’t have a habit of prying into other people’s business. Farewell.”</p>
<p>Saying so, he really turned around to leave.</p>
<p>“Wait!” Yu Ying suddenly called out again.</p>
<p>“What now?” Yang Kai shot an impatient look towards her.</p>
<p>Yu Ying’s expression became a complicated mix of embarra.s.sment and reluctance, only speaking again after a long silence, “Don’t rush off, I’ll explain everything to you.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I don’t want to know anymore. The more I know, the more trouble it will be!”</p>
<p>“You…” Yu Ying gawked at him, her face turning from green to red to blue as she grumbled, “How can you like this?”</p>
<p>This boy was acting completely like a delinquent, without the slightest majesty or n.o.bility a Holy Master should have. Didn’t he enter the Holy Tomb? How come his att.i.tude was still so defiant?</p>
<p>In the past, everyone who had pa.s.sed the Holy Tomb’s test and re-emerged had treated the Holy Land as their home.</p>
<p>Yu Ying simply couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>Seeing this beautiful woman at a loss, Yu Kai’s mood suddenly became excellent, sitting down on a nearby stool in the corner pavilion before turning to An Ling’er, “You tell me.”</p>
<p>An Ling’er snuck a glimpse towards Elder Yu Ying only to see her glaring towards Yang Kai viciously, as if she couldn’t wait to peel his skin, eat his flesh, and drink his blood. Understanding what Elder Yu Ying was feeling all too well as she had experienced similar incidents many times in the past when it came to Yang Kai, An Ling’er did her best to stifle her laughter for a while before pursing her lips and saying, “Why do you want to know about this? Once you know, it will only bring you trouble.”</p>
<p>“From what you two discussing just now, the situation is quite serious, of course I’d want to know. Besides, you just said we’re friends… I don’t have many friends,” Yang Kai suddenly said solemnly.</p>
<p>An Ling’er’s expression changed greatly upon hearing these words, a meaningful smile soon appearing on her face as she said, “That Gou Che will definitely regret not treating you sincerely in the future!”</p>
<p>“En, he will,” Yang Kai grinned, his face filled with confidence.</p>
<h2>If An Ling’er had asked him to stay when she had first discovered him, Yang Kai would have left without any hesitation.</h2>
<p>But instead she had actually encouraged him to go!</p>
<p>Obviously, she had done this completely out of consideration for him. An Ling’er being willing to go so far for him made Yang Kai reluctant to just abandon her.</p>
<p>After all, it appeared as if Nine Heavens Holy Land had suffered some kind of calamity!</p>
<p>Seeing Yang Kai take the initiative to stay, An Ling’er was particularly happy, hurriedly explaining what had transpired after he had entered the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>Only now did Yang Kai learn that it had been nine whole months since he entered the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>For the first six of those months, nothing of note had happened.</p>
<p>However, on a certain day roughly three months ago, the barrier around the periphery of Nine Heavens Holy Land’s nine spirit peaks had suddenly ceased functioning, catching all the Elders and Protectors somewhat unprepared.</p>
<p>No matter how they investigated though, they couldn’t discover what had gone wrong much less repair and re-activate the various Spirit Arrays which formed the barrier.</p>
<p>Just as everyone was at a loss, Saintess Nan, who noticed the disappearance of the barrier, attacked the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Together, the various Elders and Protectors managed to successfully repel Saintess Nan but the Holy Land suffered terrible damage in the process, many disciples suffering injuries or falling in the battle.</p>
<p>Immediately after that incident, foreign enemies appeared.</p>
<p>“Foreign enemies?” Yang Kai asked curiously.</p>
<p>“En, my Holy Land has been a peak force for many years, but what force doesn’t have enemies? When the old Holy Masters was alive, we could still deter these foes, but after his pa.s.sing two years ago, and with no new Holy Master succeeding his position, these enemies saw an opportunity. My Holy Land’s nine peaks is an excellent territory for cultivating, causing many people to secretly covet it.”</p>
<p>“So these enemies of yours decided to hit you while you’re down?” Yang Kai snickered.</p>
<p>“En,” An Ling’er nodded in agreement, looking somewhat low-spirited, “But it’s not like we have no blame in this matter. When the old Holy Master was alive, we held a dominant position, so it’s only natural they have some grievances with us…”</p>
<p>“Hmph, if it was just some trivial small forces, my Holy Land still wouldn’t even put them in our eyes, but…” Yu Ying followed up, frowning deeply as she lamented, “But for the past while, Saintess Nan has stirred up a great deal of trouble outside, so a few forces that have grudges against us took the opportunity to gather a large number of masters to pressure my Holy Land. These masters were either harmed directly by Saintess Nan, or had their loved ones killed by her, causing them to resent my Holy Land.”</p>
<p>“Seems like when it rains, it pours!” Yang Kai frowned and understood why the atmosphere inside Nine Heavens Holy Land was so bleak.</p>
<p>However, Nine Heavens Holy Land’s barrier failing three months ago coincided with when he obtained the Holy Master Spirit Ring.</p>
<p>[Could it be related to that?] Yang Kai secretly pondered, not entirely sure.</p>
<p>“Half a month ago, those people came to complain, demanding we turn over the previous generation’s Saintess to them, but in the battle three months ago, Saintess Nan was injured and fled far away. How are we supposed to find her now? Great Elder tried to explain the situation, but it didn’t help at all. The few forces coveting our nine spirit peaks continued to inflame the situation eventually leading to a fight. Both sides suffered multiple dead and wounded in that battle, worsening the situation, so not it is almost impossible to resolve this matter peacefully, haa…”</p>
<p>“Which forces are stirring up trouble?” Yang Kai asked.</p>
<p>“The ringleaders are the three nearby forces, Shattering Mystical Palace, War Spirit Temple, and Netherworld Sect!” Yu Ying said with a look of disgust and anger appearing on her pretty face, “These three forces are the main culprits. If it was just one of them, even though my Holy Land’s strength has declined greatly, we wouldn’t even bother paying attention to them, but the three of them are now working together and have simultaneously drawn in a large number of outside masters. Now, my Holy Land is facing almost half the world’s forces!”</p>
<p>“Is the situation really that bad?” Yang Kai was also taken aback.</p>
<p>However, upon remember what Saintess Nan had been doing these past two years, it wasn’t beyond the realm of possibility for things to have reached such a point.</p>
<p>Wherever Saintess Nan went, death and destruction would follow, causing a huge problem for Nine Heavens Holy Land. As a Second Order Saint, Saintess Nan’s base strength was incredible; add to that her mastery of the Nine Heavens Divine Skills, only a Third Order Saint Realm master would be able to subdue her. In this world, there weren’t many such masters!</p>
<p>Yang Kai wasn’t even sure if Soaring Heaven Sect’s Chu Ling Xiao had reached such a level.</p>
<p>“It’s even worse than you think!” Yu Ying’s expression became cold, “These three forces aren’t just coveting the Holy Land’s resources and land, what they’re most interested in is Ling’er!”</p>
<p>Saying so, she unconsciously glanced over at An Ling’er.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s thoughts turned quickly and suddenly understood, “They want to force you to join one of their Sects’ disciples together with her in order to obtain the inheritance of your Holy Master, right?”</p>
<p>Once they acquired the Holy Master’s inheritance, they could reach the sky in a single leap, it was a huge benefit that even if they struggled for a few hundred years they couldn’t obtain.</p>
<p>“Exactly!” Yu Ying nodded sternly, “When they drew back half a month ago, they gave us an ultimatum, hand over Saintess Nan one month later, or they would flatten our nine peaks! But later that day, the Great Elder received a secret letter saying that if the previous generation’s Saintess couldn’t be delivered, the current Saintess would be acceptable as a subst.i.tute!”</p>
<p>“They’ve thought this out quite well…” Yang Kai was genuine impressed with these force’s scheme. After pausing for a moment to absorb all he had just heard, he then asked, “So, are you planning to just sit here and wait for death?”</p>
<p>Yu Ying’s mood became depressed as she replied, “What else can we do? Although this world is vast, we have nowhere else to go. And there’s still half a month left until the deadline, Great Elder is even now trying to convince the forces who were roped to take a step back and negotiate. If only the three local forces remain, they won’t be able to cause any waves, and once my Holy Land recovers, we can slowly deal with them.”</p>
<p>“Your old Holy Master has really harmed you,” Yang Kai slowly shook his head. “Why didn’t he treat those three forces better before he died, at least to the point where they won’t come to cause trouble for you?”</p>
<p>“Hey! Which side are you on?” Yu Ying glanced over at Yang Kai somewhat disgruntled.</p>
<p>“I’m just telling the truth,” Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“When the old Holy Master was alive, although he did treat them somewhat overbearingly and demanded they pay a certain amount of tribute each year in the form of cultivation materials, it was because of the Nine Heavens Holy Land’s shelter that their three forces could remain safe and sound,” An Ling’ Er explained, “Now they choose to repay that kindness with enmity, they’re nothing more than ungrateful wolves.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? How did your old Holy Master shelter them?” Yang Kai was puzzled.</p>
<p>“I didn’t tell you? Our Holy Land is at the edge of the Human Territory, just over that mountain range is the Beast Sea Jungle which is the territory of the Monster Race. If it weren’t for the old Holy Master’s presence here, the Monster Race’s Great Senior over there would have already brought his forces to occupy this land.”</p>
<p>“Monster Race?” Yang Kai raised his brow and asked, “You mean to say that over there is the Monster Domain?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“Then why haven’t they taken action as well?”</p>
<p>Since the old Holy Master had fallen, the Monster Race making a move should have been given. The Three Clans all had irreconcilable enmity between them to the point where fights broke out simply by meeting one another. The Monster Race not taking advantage of such a superb opportunity didn’t make sense. Given this, Yang Kai keenly realized that there should be something more to this story than meets the eye.</p>
<p>An Ling’er glanced over at Yu Ying, seemingly seeking her opinion. Yu Ying’s pretty face wore a complex expression as she contemplated for a while before finally nodding lightly.</p>
<p>Only then did An Ling’er continue, quietly explaining, “The old Holy Master and that side’s Monster Race Great Senior seem to have some friends.h.i.+p… them not moving is probably for this reason.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Yang Kai showed an interested look, sneering as he ridiculed, “Then it seems the Monster Race is actually more humane… That Monster Race Great Senior’s strength must not be weak, right?”</p>
<p>“We’ve never met him, but it’s more than likely that’s the case,” Yu Ying nodded.</p>
<p>“And that’s the current situation,” An Ling’er said, looking straight at Yang Kai, seemingly waiting for him to state his opinion. Yu Ying also looking at him anxiously, as if she was worried he would immediately leave after learning how dire things were.</p>
<p>If that were to really happen, Yu Ying would probably break down and cry.</p>
<p>Yang Kai being able to safely return from the Holy Tomb meant he must have pa.s.sed its test. That meant that as of right now, he was essentially the Holy Land’s Holy Master. With him a.s.suming command, it would be possible to stabilize the mood of the Holy Land’s disciples and it would become more convenient to handle various large and small affairs.</p>
<p>Two beautiful women, one young, one old, staring at him so fixedly made Yang Kai feel a certain helplessness, eventually forcing him to ask, “Where are Xu Hui and the others?”</p>
<p>Hearing him ask this, both An Ling’er and Yu Ying smiled joyfully, Yu Ying quickly replying, “I’ll take you to them!”</p>
<p>Saying so, she immediately turned around and led the way.</p>
<p>Yang Kai and An Ling’er followed close behind.</p>
<p>“Does… does this mean you’re willing to become the new Holy Master?” An Ling’er suddenly whispered.</p>
<p>“I didn’t say that, so don’t misunderstand. Right now… I can make some effort, as for if it will make any difference, I can’t guarantee. I can only say that I’ll do my best. If your Holy Land is still destroyed by this catastrophe, at least you won’t be able to complain about me not trying.”</p>
<p>“En, en,” An Ling’er smiled brightly, “I knew you were a good person, we really are friends, right?”</p>
<p>“En,” Yang Kai grinned, a mischievous glint flas.h.i.+ng across his eyes, “So you’d best not fall in love with me. If you do, I’ll leave, and we won’t be friends anymore.”</p>
<p>“Hmph, don’t be so arrogant!” An Ling’er blushed bright red, hitting Yang Kai a few times, grinding her teeth as she muttered, “You really think that all the women in the world will be attracted to you? Although you’re not bad, you’re not my type at all.”</p>
<p>“Oh? What kind of man is your type then?” Yang Kai asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Someone older than me, tall and handsome, kind and caring…” An Ling’er suddenly fell into a fantasy, quickly firing off a long list traits her dream man should have.</p>
<p>“Your vision is really lacking!” Yang Kai kept shaking his head, wearing an expression seemingly bloated with arrogance, causing An Ling’er to giggling.</p>
<p>As they flew forward, Yang Kai saw numerous broken buildings and traces of blood left behind from battle.</p>
<p>The busy Holy Land disciples who saw Yu Ying and An Ling’er all stopped and saluted respectfully, but when they noticed Yang Kai who was walking together with An Ling’er, they all, without exception, showed looks of shock, none of them able to believe their own eyes.</p>
<p>Up ahead, Xu Hui was busy directing people. Yu Ying shouted out to him, causing him to turn his head to answer her, but before he could utter a single word, his eyes suddenly bulged. It was like he had seen a ghost, causing his jaw to drop, rendering him speechless for quite some time.</p>
<h2>In front of a collapsed building, Xu Hui stood there staring at Yang Kai dumbly, hardly able to believe his eyes.</h2>
<p>s.h.i.+ Kun, Cheng Yue Tong, and the other Elders also wore similar expressions.</p>
<p>“Don’t look so surprised. Or what, did you think I already died inside that tomb?” Yang Kai quipped.</p>
<p>Xu Hui finally came back to his senses, a trail of tears soon streaming down his face as he wore a joyful expression, trembling greatly as he cupped his fists and bowed deeply, “Greetings, Holy Master!”</p>
<p>“Congratulations on returning, Holy Master!” The other Elders also respectfully called out.</p>
<p>It seemed like Yang Kai appearing here now was equivalent to seeing hope, the haze and depression on their faces were instantly swept away.</p>
<p>Even the Holy Land disciples who were gathered nearby all turned fervent looks towards Yang Kai, regarding him as some kind of saviour.</p>
<p>In response, Yang Kai frowned and raised his hand, “Don’t be in such a rush to address me so…. Let’s put such matters aside for now; I’ve heard about the general situation from Elder Yu Ying and An Ling’er. Is there anything I can do to help? Speak freely, if I it’s within my ability, I’ll try my best to a.s.sist you.”</p>
<p>Xu Hui was startled, immediately understanding the meaning of Yang Kai’s words, quickly adjusting his tone as he cautiously said, “Of course, of course. The things we’re dealing with here are just minor matters such as comforting the disciples and treating the injured, there’s no need for you to intervene.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Xu Hui’s eyes unconsciously glanced towards Yang Kai’s hand, a look of disappointment soon appearing on his face.</p>
<p>“Are you looking for this?” Yang Kai flipped his hand and summoned out the Holy Master Spirit Ring.</p>
<p>Everyone gathered around trembled when they saw this small ring appear. Xu Hui nodded repeatedly as his mood recovered, excitedly shouting, “Little Brother, you really brought the Holy Master Spirit Ring out!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded lightly, putting the ring on his finger in front of everyone and casually saying, “I had wanted to deliver this ring to you when I came out, but… something unexpected came up so before I reach the Saint Realm I’ll have to keep it with me. I’ll return it to you when the time comes.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai estimated that when he broke through to the Saint Realm he would be able to take back his Soul brand from this ring.</p>
<p>“No, no, this Spirit Ring is yours now, it doesn’t matter how long you want to wear it,” Xu Hui smiled, the other Elders also nodding in agreement.</p>
<p>“However… now that we have the Holy Master Spirit Ring, things will really be much easier,” Xu Hui said in a relieved tone, “Little brother, this old master needs to ask you to do a few things.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead, Great Elder,” Yang Kai nodded.</p>
<p>“There are a large number of injured disciples and there aren’t enough healing pills and herbs available, you I’d like to ask little brother to go to the Sect’s main Treasury to take some things out.”</p>
<p>“Good, lead the way.”</p>
<p>Xu Hui quickly nodded, issuing some instructions to the other Elders before leading Yang Kai off in a certain direction.</p>
<p>After they left, the shocked expressions returned to the other Elders’ faces.</p>
<p>“He really came out of the Holy Tomb? It’s already been nine months. How did he do it?” s.h.i.+ Kun kept shaking his head, unable to understand.</p>
<p>“This has broken all records for the longest time spent in the Holy Tomb by far, right? I remember that the previous record was only two months.”</p>
<p>“Taking so long to pa.s.s the Holy Tomb’s test, could it be this new Holy Master’s ability is that poor? Did we perhaps look too highly upon him?”</p>
<p>“None of that matters, the most important thing is that he brought out the Holy Master Spirit Ring, so the Spirit Arrays that form the barrier around the nine peaks can be reactivated and we can prevent those b.a.s.t.a.r.ds’ invasion.”</p>
<p>Everyone nodded in agreement. Only Yu Ying’s eyes flashed an extremely complex light.</p>
<p>She had yet to figure out how Yang Kai had just fooled her senses and silently appeared beside her. Even if he had mastered the Nine Heavens Divine Skills, he still shouldn’t have been able to accomplish such a feat.</p>
<p>Had they looked too highly upon him, or were they actually still underestimating him?</p>
<p>“Yu Ying, what’s wrong?” Cheng Yue Tong saw her friend acting somewhat unsettled and quickly came over to ask.</p>
<p>“Nothing, I was just thinking that this future Holy Master is very different.”</p>
<p>“Different how?” Cheng Yue Tong asked curiously.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure,” Yu Ying slowly shook her head before turning around and shouting, “What are you staring at? Don’t you have things to do?”</p>
<p>The disciples who had gathered around were suddenly awoken from their daze and quickly scattered like frightened birds, returning to their own individual tasks.</p>
<p>However, word of the new Holy Master successfully pa.s.sing the Holy Tomb’s test still spread rapidly, causing all the Holy Land disciples who heard the news to rejoice, feeling the Holy Land now had hope.</p>
<p>At the same time, Yang Kai and Xu Hui arrived in front of the Holy Land’s main Treasury.</p>
<p>After a quick inspection, Yang Kai was quite surprised; he didn’t know what material this Treasury was made from but even with his unusually powerful Divine Sense he couldn’t even penetrate its outer layer much less see what was stored inside. On top of that, this Treasury was obviously incredibly st.u.r.dy, essentially impregnable to outside attacks.</p>
<p>On the way over, Xu Hui had also given Yang Kai a quick explanation of the situation.</p>
<p>The materials collected by Nine Heavens Holy Land that weren’t immediately needed were usually sent to this Treasury for preservation. Over the years, the amount of rare and precious material stockpiled in this vault was considerable.</p>
<p>However, since the fall of the old Holy Master, this place had become inaccessibly.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, the remaining materials in the Holy Land had slowly been used up, and after experiencing this most recent disaster, the last remnants had been consumed clean, leaving many of the injured disciples without any healing pills, let alone pills used to cultivate.</p>
<p>So right now the highest priority was to open the Treasury so the supplies inside could be used.</p>
<p>But the only key to open the Treasury was the Holy Master Spirit Ring brought out by Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Following Xu Hui’s instructions, Yang Kai poured his True Qi into the Holy Master Spirit Ring and then pushed the ring on his finger into a slot in the center of the Treasury’s door.</p>
<p>A flash of light appeared and the heavy door slowly slid open.</p>
<p>A huge underground warehouse appeared in front of Yang Kai’s eyes that were lined with all kinds of commodities such as herbs for Alchemy, metals for Artifact Refining, jade bottles filled with finished pills, and countless artifacts.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was dazzled and even somewhat shocked by this sight.</p>
<p>After all, this was the storage s.p.a.ce for the acc.u.mulated wealth of an apex level force; the amount of wealth in this place was simply beyond Yang Kai’s imagination.</p>
<p>“Little brother, have a look around for yourself, if there is anything you need, feel free to take it, I will go call some disciples right now to help bring out the materials we need!” Xu Hui said to Yang Kai before turning around to leave.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was immediately overjoyed.</p>
<p>The materials here were diverse and abundant, enough to supply the needs of ten thousand disciples for quite some time. It was no wonder that the three nearby forces had taken the risk of attacking Nine Heavens Holy Land. Without even mentioning how good the surrounding nine spirit peaks were for cultivating, just the wealth stored in this vault was enough to make them salivate.</p>
<p>Whether in good times or in bad times, what ultimately moved people were benefits, this was an unchanging truth.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t have the slightest reservations and immediately began wantonly stuffing herbs used for Alchemy into the Black Book s.p.a.ce in preparation for whatever the future held.</p>
<p>Yang Kai still needed to increase his Alchemy skill. Although he could currently refine Saint Grade Low-Rank pills, he was not very adept at it yet. Only when he became capable of refining Saint Grade Mid-Rank pills could he return to the endless Snow Mountain Range to find Coffin Slave Senior, enter the Mysterious Small World, and free the Ancient Demon Clan from their captivity.</p>
<p>Compared with Nine Heavens Holy Land, Yang Kai valued ​​Li Rong and Han Fei more.</p>
<p>It was also because of his complicated relations.h.i.+p with the Ancient Demon Clan that Yang Kai didn’t want to have much to do with Nine Heavens Holy Land.</p>
<p>Humans and Demons were irreconcilable enemies, if he were to become both the Holy Master and leader of the Ancient Demon Clan, if a conflict were to erupt between the two, Yang Kai would find himself caught in the middle.</p>
<p>In no time at all, Yang Kai had swept away a lot of precious spirit herbs, even acquiring materials necessary for the Saint Pill the Ancient Demon Clan needed.</p>
<p>Finally, Yang Kai had collected all the materials needed for that Saint Pill!</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s was in utter joy. Even after collecting numerous materials already, it seemed that none of the supply has diminished in the slightest. It was only when he started collecting some Crystal Stones for cultivating, that he stopped.</p>
<p>Xu Hui bustled about inside, stuffing a large number of Universe Bags with herbs before handing them to the disciples waiting outside and instructing them to deliver them to the Holy Land’s Alchemists.</p>
<p>Half a day later, this work slowly came to an end.</p>
<p>“Little brother, did you not find anything you needed?” Xu Hui saw Yang Kai empty-handed, without even a single Universe Bag, and misunderstood that he had returned empty handed.</p>
<p>However, Xu Hui was also keenly aware that besides the things he had taken, a large amount of supplies, especially high grade Alchemy’s material, were now missing, puzzling him greatly.</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” Yang Kai slowly shook his head.</p>
<p>“Let’s go then, if you want, you can come back here anytime,” Xu Hui laughed, no longer raising the issue.</p>
<p>After leaving the Treasury, Xu Hui then said, “I’ll have to trouble little brother to follow this old master again so that the Nine Peak barrier can be opened again.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded, indicating to him to lead the way.</p>
<p>The Nine Peaks Spirit Array and barrier were profound, the culmination of all the previous Holy Masters’ countless years of effort. Once opened, this barrier could withstand the indiscriminate attacks of a Saint Realm master undamaged for some time.</p>
<p>Although every Holy Master was a peak Third Order Saint, but there were always times when the Holy Master had to leave the Holy Land. When he left, it was this barrier that kept the Holy Land safe.</p>
<p>Yang Kai wasn’t proficient in barrier type Spirit Arrays as he had almost never been involved in arranging them before; however, it is not necessary for him to spend a lot of time learning about the Nine Peaks Spirit Array, all he had to do was use the Holy Master Spirit Ring in accordance with Xu Hui’s instructions to re-activate it.</p>
<p>Traveling back and forth among the nine spirit peaks, stopping from time to time, Yang Kai consumed a ma.s.sive amount of True Qi until half a day later the Spirit Array was successfully re-started.</p>
<p>World Energy once again began to rapidly flow towards the Holy Land while at the same time a thin energy membrane barely visible to the naked eye enveloped Nine Heavens Holy Land, protecting it from the outside world.</p>
<p>Xu Hui was completely shocked!</p>
<p>He was well aware of just how much True Qi it took to activate this Spirit Array; even the previous generation’s Holy Master couldn’t re-start after it shut down it within half a day.</p>
<p>It was a Spirit Array that covered the entire Holy Land.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai did just that, and even after activating the Spirit Array, his face wasn’t the slightest bit flushed, as if he hadn’t exerted any effort at all.</p>
<p>Xu Hui couldn’t even begin to speculate how ma.s.sive the amount of True Qi hidden inside Yang Kai’s body was, causing him to be deeply astonished.</p>
<p>Realizing this, Xu Hui’s att.i.tude became even more respectful.</p>
<p>He knew that although his current cultivation was higher than Yang Kai’s, in a short time, this young man would definitely ascend to a height that he would forever be unable to reach. At that time, the entire Holy Land would have to rely on Yang Kai.</p>
<h2>After hurrying about for an entire day, most of the Holy Land’s immediate concerns had been dealt with.</h2>
<p>As night fell, clouds gathered overhead, blocking out the starlight, causing a heavy aura to cover the sky above the Holy Land.</p>
<p>The various Protectors and Elders of Nine Heavens Holy Land gathered to discuss how to deal with the crisis which would befall them half a month later.</p>
<p>The various masters, led by the Holy Land’s neighbouring three forces, had already declared that after half a month, they either surrender the previous generation’s Saintess or hand over current generation’s Saintess, otherwise it would be war.</p>
<p>The three forces who had been suppressed by Nine Heavens Holy Land, daring to make such a bold statement obviously indicated how great their confidence was, otherwise their att.i.tude wouldn’t have been so intractable.</p>
<p>Handing over the previous generation’s Saintess was impossible for Xu Hui and the other Elders, they didn’t even know where Saintess Nan was right now. Likewise, it was impossible for them to hand over the current generation’s Saintess. A battle half a month later was essentially inevitable.</p>
<p>Not even knowing what this meeting was about or what intentions this group of Elders had, Yang Kai was dragged over and forced to attend by An Ling’er.</p>
<p>As the various Elders were discussing matters, Yang Kai remained silent, showing no intention to express his own opinion.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had enough self-knowledge. Although this group of Saints continuously expressed their expectation that he inherit the Holy Master’s position, at this critical juncture, he had no decision-making power. In all of their opinions, Yang Kai was still too young.</p>
<p>Therefore, Yang Kai just chose to remain silent.</p>
<p>After listening for a while, Yang Kai was surprised to discover that no one here had any thoughts of escaping, they were all determined and stay behind and fight to defend the honour of the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Yang Kai shook his head secretly, deciding not to pa.s.s judgement on this decision.</p>
<p>Although he also knew that by fleeing to the mountains one didn’t need to worry about having firewood to burn, Yang Kai was also aware that a large force like Nine Heavens Holy Land wanting to migrate was not an easy task. Even if Xu Hui and the other Elders could safely evacuate, the common disciples would likely be abandoned.</p>
<p>Right now, the most crucial thing was how to console the foreign masters that were gathered together by Shattering Mystical Palace, War Spirit Temple, and Netherworld Sect. As long as they could make these masters withdraw, even with its current weakened strength, the Holy Land could easily repel the three local forces.</p>
<p>After discussing this matter at length yet not reaching any kind of consensus, everyone’s eyes suddenly turned to Yang Kai who was sitting to the side drinking his tea.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at me for? I’m used to wandering freely, I don’t have any experience about such matters. You talk, I’ll just listen.”</p>
<p>“Heh heh…” Xu Hui let out a hollow laugh and calmly said, “Though that may be the case, surely little brother has some opinions of his own, yes? Please share them with us, perhaps a fresh perspective will help us find a solution.”</p>
<p>The other Elders in the room all turned looks of antic.i.p.ation towards Yang Kai as well, seeming curious about what he would say.</p>
<p>Yang Kai wrinkled his brow, and although he was somewhat unwilling to contribute, he still reluctantly asked, “How many Saint Realm masters are there among the three forces stirring up trouble?”</p>
<p>Xu Hui’s expression brightened as he quickly replied, “These three forces are not very powerful, each of them only possessing two Saint Realm masters, all of which as basically First Order. The only one we need to pay attention to is Zhang Ao from Shattering Mystical Palace, that old b.a.s.t.a.r.d’s cultivation is the same as mine, Second Order Saint. If the two of us were to really fight, it’s not certain who would win.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai expression moved slightly. Each of the three local forces possessing two Saints meant there was a total of six Saint Realm opponents, five of which were First Order while one of them was Second Order.</p>
<p>This lineup was the same in terms of number and cultivation as the current Nine Heavens Holy Land.</p>
<p>Right now, Nine Heavens Holy Land had one Second Order Saint and five First Order Saints.</p>
<p>This was not counting the forces which had been roped in by the three forces though; there were surely a number of powerhouses among this group. Having just suffered an attack from Saintess Nan, Nine Heavens Holy Land wanting to repel such a force was indeed unrealistic.</p>
<p>Moreover, if it really came down to a fight, even if Nine Heavens Holy Land survive, it might never be able to rise up again.</p>
<p>There were simply too many forces involved in this matter.</p>
<p>They had never wanted to become enemies with so many forces, but the trouble caused by Saintess Nan was undeniable so naturally Nine Heavens Holy Land’s had to take some responsibility.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you thought about asking for help? Nine Heavens Holy Land has existed for so many years so shouldn’t you have some allies?” Yang Kai suggested hesitantly, “Can’t you ask your allies for help during this crisis in exchange for a favour down the road?”</p>
<p>When Yang Kai spoke these words though, everyone else in the room wore an awkward embarra.s.sed.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai immediately understood. Nine Heavens Holy Land really had no allies! When the old Holy Master was alive, they were conceited, thinking that no force in the world could stand on the same level as their Holy Land, but as a result, now that their Sect had encountered a crisis, obviously no one would come to their aid.</p>
<p>Yang Kai rubbed his forehead for a while, rendered absolutely speechless by this fact.</p>
<p>He could ask Soaring Heaven Sect for help. His three Marital Uncles and his Martial Aunt would definitely respond, but there simply wasn’t enough time for that. By the time Yang Kai returned to Soaring Heaven Sect, Nine Heavens Holy Land would likely already be destroyed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, solemnly saying, “That Monster Race Great Senior… Have you ever thought about asking him for help?”</p>
<p>“The Monster Race Great Senior?” Xu Hui’s complexion changed.</p>
<p>“En, since he is a Great Senior, his strength and the strength of his subordinates is certainly not weak.”</p>
<p>“You must be joking,” s.h.i.+ Kun frowned, “Those Monster Race powerhouses only regard us humans as eyesores. If we were to ask for help from them and they accepted, once word of it spread out, Nine Heavens Holy Land would immediately become an enemy of the entire human race and never be able to rise again.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Yu Ying gently nodded, agreeing with s.h.i.+ Kun’s statement, “No matter how bad the situation becomes, it is impossible for us to ask for reinforcements from the Monster Race. In addition, none of us have ever met with that Monster Race Great Senior, only the old Holy Master has some friends.h.i.+p with him, there’s very little chance we could convince him to help even if we did ask.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai was stunned, never having expected his proposal to be so firmly rejected; only not understanding that he had greatly underestimated the degree of hatred between the different races.</p>
<p>He was not a native of Tong Xuan Realm and although he had been in this world for a number of years now, the deep-rooted prejudices of this world had not affected him much.</p>
<p>Before coming here, Yang Kai hadn’t even known about the existence of difference races like the Demon Race and Monster Race.</p>
<p>“There is a person who, if he can be found, may be able to easily resolve the Holy Land’s crisis,” Xu Hui suddenly fell into contemplation and whispered softly.</p>
<p>“Does Great Elder mean that man?” Cheng Yue Tong seems to remember something and immediately asked.</p>
<p>“En.”</p>
<p>“What man?” Yang Kai was curious, not knowing who they were talking about, but surmising he was some extraordinary master.</p>
<p>“An old man with mysterious origins, we don’t know anything specific about him, but he should be an old friend of the previous Holy Master. Half a year before the old Holy Master fell, that old man suddenly came to visit him and stayed a few days in the Holy Land. During that time, the old Holy Master was very courteous towards him, so the relations.h.i.+p between them shouldn’t be just a casual one. If we can find him, he would surely help us.”</p>
<p>“En, that old man had a profound aura around him, as if he was impossible to see through. Moreover, I have never seen the old Holy Master act so politely towards another individual before, so he obviously isn’t some average person,” Yu Ying followed up.</p>
<p>“An old man with mysterious origins?” Yang Kai was stunned, “Do you have any idea where he is now?”</p>
<p>Everyone shook their heads.</p>
<p>“However, he should return to the Holy Land again at some point,” Xu Hui suddenly said confidently.</p>
<p>“Why do you say that?”</p>
<p>“Because when he came to my Holy Land, the little girl accompanying him left something behind on one of the nine peaks. After he left, the old Holy Master told me to pay special attention to that place and not allow anyone to approach or damage it. I a.s.sume after a certain period of time that old man and little girl will come back here and retrieve whatever it is they deposited there.”</p>
<p>“En, after that little girl set up some kind of array in that place, I had a casual look once,” Meng Tian Fei nodded, somewhat helplessly confessing, “Whatever it is she did though, has made the place uninhabitable. If one stays there too long, they’ll freeze, even I couldn’t stand being there for very long.”</p>
<p>Listening to their words, Yang Kai suddenly understood what they were talking about.</p>
<p>When he was opening the Nine Peaks Spirit Array and barrier with Xu Hui during the day, he indeed came across an odd place. That region was particularly cold, and not just in a temperature sense. There was some kind of unusual chill in the air that caused one to feel quite uncomfortable.</p>
<p>At the time, Yang Kai thought it was a natural occurrence, some kind of restricted zone in Nine Heavens Holy Land, but apparently that was not the case.</p>
<p>However, suddenly hearing about an old man accompanied by a little girl, a certain familiar pair emerged in Yang Kai’s mind.</p>
<p>Chuckling to himself, Yang Kai shook his head, thinking there was no way such a coincidence could possible happen.</p>
<p>With a smile on his face, he asked casually, “That old guy you mentioned, he wouldn’t happen to be a geezer that tries to put on a sagely appearance yet has a wandering obscene gaze?”</p>
<p>Xu Hui didn’t have time to respond before Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong both nodded, Yu Ying even gritting her teeth as she grumbled, “Exactly! That old b.a.s.t.a.r.d’s eyes were always staring at places they shouldn’t be.”</p>
<p>Cheng Yue Tong also chimed in, “En, en, at his age yet still acting so wantonly, Yu Ying and I somehow managed to treat him politely, but in truth we couldn’t wait to dig out his eyes!”</p>
<p>The breathing of the two beautiful women both became rough, seemingly still quite angry with that old man.</p>
<p>Xu Hui, on the other hand, smiled dumbly, “Aren’t you two perhaps mistaken? When one reaches a certain height, their eyes are naturally filled with ‘life’.”</p>
<p>Yu Ying and Cheng Yue Tong both glared coldly at Xu Hui at the same time.</p>
<p>“Ahem, just pretend I never said anything,” Xu Hui’s immediately retreated.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression, on the other hand, became cramped, his pulse slightly accelerating as a sense of excitement and expectation filled his chest, continuing to ask, “Was that little girl wearing a veil, making people unable to see her true appearance, but still giving off a pure, and innocent aura?”</p>
<p>Everyone in the room turned to look at Yang Kai with amazement, Xu Hui asking in a shocked tone, “Holy Master, you… <em>ahem</em>, little brother, how did you know?”</p>
<p>“Seriously?” Yang Kai suddenly felt a little dumbfounded, quickly confirming his suspicions, “Did she also wear a light blue gem on her forehead?”</p>
<h2>Hearing Yang Kai’s question, everyone nodded, Yu Ying adding, “Although that old guy was somewhat hateful, the little girl who was accompanying him was another story entirely. Although we couldn’t see her true appearance, I don’t think she was any less beautiful than our Saintesses, and… her cultivation was also incredible, no worse than yours. Before meeting you, she was the greatest genius of the younger generation I’d ever seen.”</h2>
<p>“That was two or three years ago, her current cultivation is probably higher than mine!” Yang Kai declared, his mood suddenly become somewhat complicated.</p>
<p>Meng Wu Ya and Xia Ning Chang!</p>
<p>There were not many people who the Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land would treat with courtesy, but Meng Wu Ya was one of them. Coupled with the fact he was followed by a little girl similar to Xia Ning Chang… The people Xu Hui and the other Elders were talking about could only be them.</p>
<p>They had actually come to Nine Heavens Holy Land, a fact that surprised Yang Kai greatly.</p>
<p>“Does little brother know them?” Xu Hui and the others glanced around at each other after noticing Yang Kai’s unusual state, the meaningful smile on his face that was somewhat absentminded, as if he was lost in his memories, making them realize that this new Holy Master might be old friends with that pair.</p>
<p>“How should I put this…? I’m acquainted with them,” Yang Kai smiled.</p>
<p>Xu Hui’s mood brightened and was just about to ask but Yang Kai cut him off before he had the chance, “Unfortunately I haven’t seen them for a number of years and I don’t know where they are right now.”</p>
<p>“Ah…” Xu Hui showed a disappointing look, but quickly recovered, “Since we can’t find someone to help us, we can only rely on our own strength now. Fortunately, little brother has retrieved the Holy Master Spirit Ring so if those people dare to attack, they will certainly pay a heavy price!”</p>
<p>“Good!” The crowd nodded, continuing their discussion.</p>
<p>Yang Kai found an opportunity and sneak away.</p>
<p>Following his memories from earlier that day, he soon came to a certain spot on one of the nine peaks.</p>
<p>This mountain was not much different from the other eight, standing tens of thousands of meters high, towering up into the sky, a magnificent scene to behold.</p>
<p>However, halfway up the mountain, a frigid aura appeared. The higher one climbed, the more intense this aura became and close to the summit, countless icicles hung from the rocky ridges, like sharp spears.</p>
<p>During the day, when Yang Kai was reactivating the Nine Peaks Spirit Array, he had found this place somewhat odd, but had not given it much thought at the time.</p>
<p>Now he wanted to see just what his Little Senior Sister had set up and left behind here.</p>
<p>Flying upwards, it only took a moment to reach the summit where the chill in the air was so strong it seemed to penetrate into the depths of the soul and freeze one’s thoughts.</p>
<p>Yang Kai began probing the area but soon paled slightly. He found that even with his Conflagrated Knowledge Sea, he had to exert his full strength in order to stop his Soul from being affected by the chill in the air.</p>
<p>As for his body, even circulating his True Qi at full speed Yang Kai couldn’t completely dispel the cold which penetrated his skin.</p>
<p>[How strange!]</p>
<p>Yang Kai slowly shook his head, but with great confidence in his ability still boldly went forward.</p>
<p>After a while, a clear and deep pond suddenly appeared before Yang Kai’s eyes, the chill seemingly emanating from its depths. Around its perimeter was small depression, which seemed to have been left by people. [It seemed that not everyone from the Nine Heavens Holy Land has completely avoided coming here.]</p>
<p>Around the deep pond, there were some subtle energy fluctuations, arranged in a mysterious and profound manner.</p>
<p>Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to probe these fluctuations and soon a smile of delight appeared on his face.</p>
<p>This was definitely his Little Senior Sister’s handiwork. Yang Kai could tell because the Spirit Arrays which were giving off the energy fluctuations contained many traces of the Spirit Arrays he had taught Xia Ning Chang.</p>
<p>Why had she done this though? From what Yang Kai heard from Xu Hui, Xian Ning Chang and Treasurer Meng did not take anything away from this place, probably because the time was not right, which also indicated that they’d likely return at some point.</p>
<p>What secrets were hidden in the depths of this frigid pond? Was it related to breaking the seal placed on Meng Wu Ya?</p>
<p>Yang Kai secretly guessed but couldn’t say for certain.</p>
<p>Chu Ling Xiao said that Meng Wu Ya had fought with the Demon Commander and was. .h.i.t by the latter’s Profound Heavenly Seal, suppressing his cultivation to the Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary. This led to Treasurer Meng to seek refuge in Yang Kai’s homeland. Searching for someone with a Sacred Spirit Medicine Body might also have been a reason Meng Wu Ya traveled to the other world.</p>
<p>Beneath the Central Capital, Meng Wu Ya managed to lift the first layer of the seal and restore his strength to the Second Order Transcendent Realm. After not seeing him for so many years though, Yang Kai couldn’t be sure what his current situation was.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had always been very curious about Treasurer Meng’s true cultivation.</p>
<p>That old man knew Chu Ling Xiao and was friends with Ice Sect’s Sect Master, Qing Ya, he even knew the old Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land…</p>
<p>Which one of these three was not a top level master? Being able to a.s.sociate with such people must mean Treasurer Meng’s true strength couldn’t be much worse than theirs.</p>
<p>On top of that, everywhere he went, he seemed to leave behind a profound impression on others.</p>
<p>“Why did you come to see the Reflecting Moon Pond?” A voice suddenly called out from behind. Yang Kai was in deep thought and hadn’t even detected this newcomer’s approach, so when he heard these words he immediately condensed his True Qi, but in the next instant he calmed down and turned to look at An Ling’er and said, “I just wanted to take a look around. This place is called Reflecting Moon Pond?”</p>
<p>“En,” An Ling’er smiled as she looked up into the sky, “There’s no moon tonight, if there were, the view would have been even more beautiful. What kind of secret the Reflecting Moon Pond holds, no one knows, but it can show a near perfect reflection of the moon and stars above, indistinguishable from the real thing. I used to come here to play with Xiao Lian frequently…”</p>
<p>Seeming remembering about her three sisters who were killed by Saintess Nan, An Ling’er’s mood suddenly dampened.</p>
<p>“Is it really so mysterious?” Yang Kai quickly changed the subject to avoid An Ling’er dwelling on her sadness, “Even though it’s inside your territory, your Nine Heavens Holy Land doesn’t know what’s hidden here?”</p>
<p>An Ling’er shook her head slowly, “Great Elder and the other Elders don’t dare explore its depths. No one knows how deep this Reflecting Moon Pond is. The old Holy Master once went down to try to uncover its mysteries but returned empty handed; after he came out, he forbade anyone else from entering though, so what is hidden inside, no one knows. Moreover, originally, this peak didn’t have this pervasive chill, only when one dove into the Reflecting Moon Pond would they feel cold. I don’t know how it became like this but it should be related to the Spirit Array that little girl arranged here.”</p>
<p>After she finished explaining, An Ling’er apparently couldn’t take it anymore, s.h.i.+vering as she hastily said, “Let’s go back, it’s too cold here.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded, not insisting on staying any longer, and flew down with her.</p>
<p>Yang Kai spent the rest of the night in contemplation and reflection, eventually coming to a decision about his next course of action.</p>
<p>The next day, he went to find Xu Hui and directly said, “Great Elder, I want to meet that Monster Race Great Senior!”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Xu Hui couldn’t help doing a double-take, hurriedly asking, “Why does little brother want to see him? Do you still want to ask him for help?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled and shook his head, “He might have had a relations.h.i.+p with the old Holy Master but no friends.h.i.+p exists between him and I, even if I ask him for help, the answer will obviously be no.”</p>
<p>“Then why do you…” Xu Hui somewhat couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression suddenly became solemn and he hesitated for a moment before asking, “Great Elder, have you ever thought about abandoning the Holy Land’s territory?”</p>
<p>“You mean escaping?” Xu Hui frowned.</p>
<p>“Yes, escaping, of course, only temporarily,” Yang Kai nodded firmly, “As the saying goes, by staying in the azure mountains, one need not fear having wood to burn. Now, surrounded by foreign enemies, the Holy Land has no way to resist. If the situation really breaks down and turns into a fight, I’m afraid Nine Heavens Holy Land will really be destroyed in your generation. When things reach that point, how many of you will be able to escape? Perhaps you Elders and Protectors with your profound strength and deep cultivation will be able to flee, but what about the remaining disciples?”</p>
<p>Xu Hui expression became gloomy as he sighed deeply, “this is something we all understand, but the Holy Land’s disciples number between six and seven thousand, where could we possible go with so many people? Shattering Mystical Palace, War Spirit Temple, and Netherworld Sect have all chosen to thoroughly offend my Holy Land; naturally they won’t give up easily now. They also understand the concept of beating a snake to death to avoid future calamities. I’m afraid that if we try to stage a ma.s.s evacuation, they will immediately chase after and attack us. Since that’s the case, we might as well stay and fight where we have the territorial advantage.”</p>
<p>“So, you have considered it?” Yang Kai’s eyes flashed.</p>
<p>Xu Hui nodded somewhat awkwardly, “Although doing so is a great humiliation to our ancestors, right now what’s most important is to preserve the blood of the Holy Land. When we have acc.u.mulated enough strength, we can stage a comeback and make those who desecrated the Holy Land pay a steep price!”</p>
<p>As he spoke these words, Xu Hui’s face filled with determination and anger.</p>
<p>“Good good, since you’ve already thought about it, I don’t need to worry about convincing you,” Yang Kai laughed sinisterly, continuing a moment later, “I have a place to safely house all the Holy Land’s people. As long as we move there, no one will have any way of harming you.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Xu Hui’s eyes lit up, asking somewhat curiously, “Little brother is referring to…”</p>
<p>“It’s not convenient to tell you now; just wait, when the time comes I’ll inform you. Of course, the premise is that you believe me!” Yang Kai said vaguely.</p>
<p>“I believe, naturally I believe!” Xu Hui nodded repeatedly, soon becoming confused though, “What does any of this have to do with you going to see that Monster Race Great Senior?”</p>
<p>“These two matters really have nothing to do with each other, at least not directly, but if you really agree to give up the Holy Land’s territory for a while, I think seeing that Monster Race Great Senior is a necessary,” Yang Kai grinned fiercely, “The Holy Land’s foundation can’t simply be handed over to those three forces freely; in that case… if that Monster Race Great Senior learned that Holy Land was now empty, what do you think he would do?”</p>
<p>Xu Hui knit his brow slightly and quickly muttered, “The World Energy aura inside the Monster Race’s territory isn’t nearly as rich as my Holy Land’s. They have also coveted this place for a long time. If they were to learn that the Holy Land had been deserted, I’m afraid they would immediately invade and occupy the nine peaks…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Xu Hui suddenly understood what Yang Kai wanted to do, a look of shock filling his eyes as his face twitched slightly. He had never expected that this new, young Holy Master actually had such a sinister and devious side.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled villainously as he spoke in a frightful tone, “My mother taught me, those who respect me one step, I should respect ten steps, but those who wrong me, I should beat three times over!”</p>
<p>Xu Hui couldn’t help feeling a chill run up his spine, as if he had just been thrown out into a frigid blizzard, only able to mutter somewhat haltingly after a long time, “Your mother is a true hero…”</p>
<p>“Good, I know that you can’t take responsibility for such a decision alone, go discuss it with the other Elders now, if they all agree, let me know.”</p>
<p>Xu Hui’s eyes flashed as he cupped his fists and said, “Although I can’t take responsibility for such a decision by myself, if little brother were to promise to inherit…”</p>
<p>“Scram!” Yang Kai didn’t wait for Xu Hui to finish before bluntly cutting him off.</p>
<p>The corner of Xu Hui’s lips twitched for a moment before he let out a sigh and flew off.</p>
<h2>Yang Kai hated being led around by others, his fate could only be forged with his own hands.</h2>
<p>It was for this reason that he had always been extremely opposed to the idea of inheriting the position of Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land, because this was not something he sought on his own. No matter how friendly the people of the Holy Land were to him, his intentions were simply incompatible.</p>
<p>However, when Yang Kai learned that Xia Ning Chang and Meng Wu Ya came here and arranged something around the Reflecting Moon Pond, Yang Kai’s resistance to Nine Heavens Holy Land noticeably decreased.</p>
<p>By preserving the foundation of Nine Heavens Holy Land, perhaps he could meet his Little Senior Sister again in the future!</p>
<p>He had already found Su Yan who was now staying in Ice Sect, concentrating on cultivation. As for Old Demon, Yang Kai wasn’t worried, that old Devil Lord was not someone good to provoke. It was only his Little Senior Sister that he would often worry about.</p>
<p>Now that he had found a concrete method to reunite with her, Yang Kai naturally didn’t want to see this hope dashed by some foreign enemies’ invasion.</p>
<p>Therefore he had taken the initiative to make this proposal to Xu Hui’s.</p>
<p>Soon, Xu Hui sent word and, just as Yang Kai had expected, after learning that there was a place that could safely house the Holy Land’s disciples, the various Elders and Protectors all expressed their willingness to temporarily evacuate in order to preserve their strength in antic.i.p.ation of retaliating one day.</p>
<p>However, regarding this place which could house six or seven thousand disciples, they were obviously curious and repeatedly inquired about. However, Yang Kai was unwilling to inform them and the issue was only resolved when An Ling’er stepped forward to mediate the situation, convincing the Elders to temporarily back off.</p>
<p>“Since you’ve decided to follow my suggestion, let’s move on to other matters. Tell me everything you know about that Monster Race Great Senior,” Inside a grand hall, Yang Kai looked across at the Elders and quickly said, “The more detailed the better.”</p>
<p>After coming to Tong Xuan Realm, Yang Kai had only ever met a single member of the Monster Race.</p>
<p>The Charm Monster!</p>
<p>That devilish woman could use her Spiritual Energy toxin to stimulate the basest desires buried inside a human’s heart. But aside from that, Yang Kai essentially knew nothing about the Monster Race. Now that he was planning to go see a Monster Race Great Senior, naturally he had to prepare himself.</p>
<p>“None of us have met that Monster Race Great Senior, but from what the old Holy Master told us, he is an Eighth-Order Monster Beast. What’s more, he is naturally capable of cultivating two different elemental attributes. His strength is quite impressive and he has a number of powerful inborn Divine Abilities.”</p>
<p>“An Eighth-Order Monster Beast…” Yang Kai frowned. In the past he had speculated that a Sixth-Order Monster Beast was equivalent to a human Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivator, while a Seventh-Order was equivalent to a Transcendent. So, an Eighth-Order was essentially a Saint.</p>
<p>In other words, the Monster Race Great Senior had strength on par with a Second Order Saint Realm master at least, most likely a Third Order!</p>
<p>“That Monster Race Great Senior also has a number of Eighth-Order Monster Beast subordinates who, while not as strong as him, are by no means weak. There are also a large number of Seventh-Order and Sixth-Order Monster Beasts who serve under him but those who have achieved human form only number around twenty.”</p>
<p>“Twenty or so, all of them at least equivalent to Transcendent, Seventh-Order and above…”</p>
<p>“They are naturally gifted in combat as well, so although they have not cultivated any Martial Skills, their strength in battle should not be underestimated.”</p>
<p>“They also don’t understand Spirit Arrays, so the World Energy where they live is not very rich and is completely determined by nature.”</p>
<p>Everyone began explaining what little information they knew to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai listened carefully to them, only asking curiously once they had finished, “The hatred between the two races is not shallow, so how did your old Holy Master manage to befriend that Monster Race Great Senior?”</p>
<p>Xu Hui chuckled and explained, “The Monster Race’s territory doesn’t have many Crystal Stone mines but it has an abundance of spirit gra.s.ses and spirit medicines. Once, the old Holy Master went out to search for a certain herb and coincidentally ran into that Monster Race Great Senior. The two of them fought for a while but neither of them could triumph over the other. After exchanging blows for a while, they apparently gained a kind of mutual respect for one another and negotiated a kind of trade deal. From then on, the old Holy Master would occasionally bring a large number of Crystal Stones with him to exchange for spirit gra.s.ses, spirit herbs, and some rare ores and materials from that side. They aren’t very proficient in Alchemy or Artifact Refining, so the artifacts and pills they use were basically supplied to them by the old Holy Masters.”</p>
<p>“So it’s like that…” Yang Kai nodded lightly, “Then, if that Monster Race Great Senior still respects that old friends.h.i.+p, I shouldn’t encounter any danger this time… En, that should be the case!”</p>
<p>“Why do you think so?” Xu Hui asked curiously.</p>
<p>“The old Holy Master fell almost two years ago. The Monster Race must have gotten word of such a big development a long time ago yet they haven’t taken any action. The only explanation is because the Monster Race Great Senior doesn’t plan on hitting Nine Heavens Holy Land while it’s down. If that weren’t the case, your Holy Land’s current situation would be far worse than it is now!”</p>
<p>Listening to Yang Kai’s explanation, everyone only thought about it slightly before nodding in agreement.</p>
<p>“I heard that the Monster Race has a magical ground called the Beast Transformation Pond, yes?” Yang Kai asked suddenly.</p>
<p>“En,” Xu Hui nodded, “The Beast Transformation Pond is the foundation of the Monster Race. I don’t know how it was created, but every place that has a Beast Transformation Pond has a large gathering of Monster Race powerhouses living nearby. On that side, whenever a Monster Beast breaks through to the Seventh-Order, it is eligible to enter the Beast Transformation Pond, and if it’s luck and opportunity is good enough, it can transform into human form. If not, those Monster Beasts can only forever remain in their beast form.”</p>
<p>“Something like that really exists?” Yang Kai suddenly became interested, unable to help himself from wanting to see one of these mysterious ponds.</p>
<p>Xu Hui however shook his head, “Not every Monster Beast that enters it can successfully obtain a human form, I’ve heard that many Monster Beasts fail in their attempt. But even if they manage to obtain a human form, many of the Monster Races chose to remain in their true form most of the time. As such, even though we only see around twenty of them at a time, it is quite likely that there are more members of the Monster Race, possibly even double that number.”</p>
<p>“Impressive!” Yang Kai praised liberally.</p>
<p>The entire Nine Heavens Holy Land only had about that many Transcendents, which meant that the strength of the Monster Race group just across the mountains was basically on par with the Holy Land even at its peak.</p>
<p>“Prepare some Crystal Stones first,” Yang Kai ordered, “Since I will be meeting the Monster Race Great Senior for the first time, as a Junior, it is only natural I bring some gifts, or else I probably won’t even be able to see him.”</p>
<p>“Good, I will arrange it,” Xu Hui responded and immediately went out.</p>
<p>An hour or so later, everything was prepared. Yang Kai took two Universe Bags filled with Crystal Stones and left the nine peaks in the direction of the jungle.</p>
<p>The Protectors and Elders of the Holy Land all watched him leave, complicated looks upon their faces.</p>
<p>“Great Elder, why does it feel like the att.i.tude of the new Holy Master has suddenly changed a lot?” s.h.i.+ Kun frowned.</p>
<p>“En, it’s as if he has become enthusiastic about protecting the Holy Land. He used to have an indifferent att.i.tude, but now…” Cheng Yue Tong also wrinkled her brow.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Xu Hui slowly shook his head, “But whatever the cause, it is a good thing. Him being concerned about the Holy Land today means he is more likely to succeed the position of Holy Master tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it’s related to the Reflecting Moon Pond,” An Ling’er muttered.</p>
<p>“Oh? Why do you say that?”</p>
<p>“Just a guess,” An Ling’er smiled, but couldn’t explain any further.</p>
<p>“Ling’er, can we really believe him? He said he knows of a place where so many Holy Land disciples can take shelter and has now suddenly left to meet with a Monster Race Great Senior, I can’t comprehend what he is thinking!” Yu Ying said worriedly.</p>
<p>“Weren’t we all prepared to fight to the death against the enemies outside our gates? If he succeeds, the situation may turn for the better, if not, we will simply have to act in accordance with our previous plans. Since that’s the case, what does it matter if we believe in him or not?”</p>
<p>“True,” Yu Ying smiled, feeling slightly relieved.</p>
<p>“But… if you’re asking me personally, I believe him,” An Ling’er’s face suddenly became solemn. “He is someone who can always survive through. Regardless of how hopeless the situation he is thrown into. Turning danger into safety, I think he can do so again this time.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, when all of this is over, whether he agrees or not, this old master will regard him as Holy Master!” Xu Hui firmly declared.</p>
<p>“It is exactly as Great Elder says,” The crowd nodded, their gazes filled with antic.i.p.ation.</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>Yang Kai had only just left the nine peaks before he suddenly felt he was being watched.</p>
<p>Shattering Mystical Palace, War Spirit Temple, and Netherworld Sect had gathered a great many masters together and attacked Nine Heavens Holy Land half a month ago. Although they were forced to retreat, they had certainly not gone far and had obviously set up patrols nearby in order to monitor Nine Heavens Holy Land’s movements while they waited for the deadline they set to come.</p>
<p>Anyone who left the Holy Land’s territory would definitely be spotted by them.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai wasn’t the slightest bit fl.u.s.tered. With his powerful Divine Sense, the cultivation levels of his pursuers were clear to him.</p>
<p>A single First Order Transcendent, and a dozen Immortal Ascension cultivators!</p>
<p>Such a team wasn’t even enough to fill the gaps between Yang Kai’s teeth.</p>
<p>After chasing him for an hour through the mountains, those people lost Yang Kai’s trail.</p>
<p>The Transcendent Realm leader’s expression became solemn as he came to a halt and signaled his Immortal Ascension Boundary subordinates to gather around and carefully probe their surroundings; however, no matter how they searched, none of them could perceive Yang Kai’s position.</p>
<p>“Senior, where did that little brat go?” From amongst the team, a young man with a square head asked.</p>
<p>The Transcendent Realm master slowly shook his head, his expression becoming even more dignified as he said, “This boy is somewhat strange, we should fall back.”</p>
<p>“He didn’t look very old so his strength shouldn’t be too high, right?” The young man sneered, thinking this Senior was being too cautious.</p>
<p>“What do you know? Do you think that all young people in this world are as useless as you? That boy might look younger than you, but since he can escape from my perception, it’s obvious his strength is not to be trifled with. Perhaps… he already noticed us and was simply trying to lead us into a trap up ahead.”</p>
<p>The youth who had been scolded and slandered seemed to be slightly dissatisfied, grumbling under his breath, “I don’t think he’s that strong.”</p>
<p>The Transcendent Realm master sneered and no longer spoke any nonsense, simply saying, “If you think you’re stronger than him, go chase him yourself, I’d like to see if you can come back alive.”</p>
<p>Saying so, he turned around to leave.</p>
<p>This team was made up of cultivators from a number of forces. Because the region around Nine Heavens Holy Land they needed to monitor was vast, a large number of people were required so the groupings had become somewhat messy. After the youth was reprimanded by someone from a different Sect, he was naturally unhappy, but although his words were somewhat impertinent, since this Senior planned to leave, naturally he wouldn’t stay behind by himself. And so, with a sullen expression, the youth also followed behind the crowd silently.</p>
<p>The moment the youth turned around though, he saw the First Order Transcendent who was leading their team suddenly come to a stop again. Glancing at this Senior’s face, the youth noticed the former had a terrified expression and was s.h.i.+vering in fright.</p>
<p>“What happened?” The young man who had been reprimanded before couldn’t help muttering, glancing towards where his Transcendent team leader was staring. What he saw there caused him to become dumbstruck.</p>
<h2>Down below, under the shade of a big tree, the young man who had flown out of Nine Heavens Holy Land had at some point unknown to them appeared behind them. He was just standing there smiling casually towards their group.</h2>
<p>Everyone realized they were in a critical situation and hurriedly pushed their True Qi as they stared towards Yang Kai vigilantly.</p>
<p>The method this youth had used to evade their senses and approach them was enough to demonstrate his extraordinary ability. Everyone in this patrol team had some degree of vision, so they immediately understood that Yang Kai was not someone good to provoke.</p>
<p>In particular, the lead Transcendent, who was the closest to Yang Kai, had constantly been trying to probe the latter’s depths but no matter how he used his Divine Sense, it was like he was staring into a bottomless sea, unable to determine anything, causing him to feel extremely shocked.</p>
<p>“I’ll stall him, the rest of you split up!” The Transcendent Realm leader shouted to everyone.</p>
<p>Yang Kai simply maintained his smile, turning a deaf ear to this man’s words as he walked towards them.</p>
<p>As Yang Kai approached them, everyone in this patrol team felt as if a huge pressure had descended upon them from the sky, as if they were standing in the path of an avalanche, incapable of resisting.</p>
<p>The Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivators couldn’t help feeling like collapsing to the ground, as if under this pressure they would soon be ground into dust, bones and all.</p>
<p>“Run!” The Transcendent screamed, forcefully circulating his True Qi as he soared into the sky.</p>
<p>“You think you can run?” Yang Kai coldly snorted as his Spiritual Energy condensed into a sharp blade and shot towards the Transcendent’s forehead, in the next instant tearing apart the latter’s Knowledge Sea defences.</p>
<p>A small piece of jade that was worn around this Transcendent’s neck flashed brilliantly before immediately shattering.</p>
<p>This jade pendant was a Soul defensive artifact designed to protect against enemy Divine Sense attacks and its grade was not bad, at least Mysterious Grade Mid-Rank.</p>
<p>But even so, this artifact was completely destroyed by Yang Kai’s Divine Sense attack.</p>
<p>The man, who had just flown up into the sky, came cras.h.i.+ng down, his eyes losing all semblance of light. The First Order Transcendent slammed head first into the ground as he let out a piercing howl, the sound pa.s.sing into the ears of the surrounding Immortal Ascension cultivators, sending cold chills up their spines.</p>
<p>The young man with the square head realized just how ma.s.sive the gap in strength between him and Yang Kai was in that instant and understood that the Senior who led his team had not made the slightest exaggeration.</p>
<p>The young man didn’t know what method Yang Kai had used just now, but to reduce a First Order Transcendent to such a miserable state, how deep would this youth’s cultivation have to be?</p>
<p>The miserable cries only lasted for ten breaths before gradually weakening and eventually stopping all together, the Transcendent Realm cultivators now lying stiffly on the ground, not moving.</p>
<p>Dead!</p>
<p>The remaining dozen or so Immortal Ascension cultivators all shuddered and the sound of their teeth chattering was audible, each and every one of them staring towards Yang Kai in horror, none of them know what to do now.</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced around at them faintly, all of them quickly turning their heads as he did, none of them having the courage to meet eyes with him.</p>
<p>A dozen Immortal Ascension cultivators… Yang Kai couldn’t help chuckling wryly at this sight. Back when he was in the Central Capital, this kind of lineup would be considered quite formidable, but only a few years later, Yang Kai could actually completely disregard their combat strength.</p>
<p>These people were now no different from ants before him.</p>
<p>“I have some questions to ask you, who can answer me?” Yang Kai suddenly said.</p>
<p>These people were all scared stiff, each of them thinking they were going to die soon, so none of them reacted immediately; however, the square headed youth was actually able to compose himself somewhat quicker than the others and shouted, “I can!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai shot a glance towards this youth and nodded lightly, “Tell me, where are you guys stationed?”</p>
<p>“We have a camp set up at the base of a mountain roughly fifty kilometers from your n.o.ble sect!” The young man was afraid that if he answered too slowly it would annoy Yang Kai so he blurted out a response as quickly as he could.</p>
<p>“How many of you are there?”</p>
<p>“At least three thousand…”</p>
<p>“That’s certainly a lot, how many Saints?” Yang Kai continued questioning. Three thousand was less than half the number of people Nine Heavens Holy Land had, but if a fight really broke out, what was important was the number of masters each side had. If one side’s masters emerged victorious, that side would win the war.</p>
<p>Only those with Transcendent or Saint Realm cultivations mattered. No matter how many cultivators below the Transcendent Realm there were, their combat strength would make no difference.</p>
<p>“Liu Gui, if you dare reveal information to the enemy, once we return, your head will fly from your neck!” One of the Immortal Ascension cultivators in the crowd with some backbone shouted after coming to his senses.</p>
<p>The others in the group also turned angry and disdainful looks towards the young man named Liu Gui.</p>
<p>Liu Gui immediately became nervous and he didn’t dare continue speaking, only able to turn a timid and anxious look towards Yang Kai, as if worried about annoying him with this indecisive att.i.tude.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai just smiled softly and nodded, “You can rest a.s.sured that no one will ever learn you told me this information, so speak freely!”</p>
<p>Saying so, Yang Kai waved his hand towards the surrounding Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivators causing them all to lose strength and kneel on the ground, none of them able to move or even speak, each of them sweating profusely as they s.h.i.+vered in fear.</p>
<p>Having received Yang Kai’s a.s.surance, Liu Gui seemed to be relieved and quickly revealed everything he knew.</p>
<p>As he listened, Yang Kai’s expression became gloomier and gloomier.</p>
<p>It seemed this time Nine Heavens Holy Land was truly facing a great disaster.</p>
<p>Shattering Mystical Palace, War Spirit Temple, and Netherworld Sect had not only managed to rally their own allies and friends again Nine Heavens Holy Land, but taking advantage of the destruction Saintess Nan had wrought outside, they had even managed to rope in another dozen forces to their cause.</p>
<p>None of these dozen or so forces were too strong, each of them possessing a single Saint Realm master at most, some not even having such a powerhouse among their ranks.</p>
<p>However, counting the six Saints the three Sects had between them, the total number of Saints Nine Heavens Holy Land was currently facing was twelve.</p>
<p>In terms of numbers, the enemy had twice as many top level masters as Nine Heavens Holy Land; as for Transcendents, the difference was even greater.</p>
<p>If it became a fight, Nine Heavens Holy Land had no chance of winning, even with the help of the Nine Peaks Spirit Array and barrier; they would only be able to resist the enemy for a short time.</p>
<p>As Xu Hui had said, since the three Sects had chosen to thoroughly offend the Holy Land, they had spared no effort to ensure their victory. There was no chance they would give Holy Land an opportunity to make a comeback.</p>
<p>There had been no attacks since their first offensive not only because they had delivered the Holy Land an ultimatum, but also because they were waiting for more reinforcements to arrive.</p>
<p>Half a month later, they would no doubt invade in ma.s.se, destroy Nine Heavens Holy Land and plunder the wealth this colossus had acc.u.mulated over thousands of years before carving up its territory.</p>
<p>Besides the three Sects, the other forces had basically gathered here because of Saintess Nan and had no deep hatred with Nine Heavens Holy Land.</p>
<p>Liu Gui was born with a square head but he was also a clever person. Even under the hate filled glares of his companions, he told Yang Kai various pieces of valuable information.</p>
<p>After listening to Liu Gui’s words, Yang Kai had a fairly good idea of his enemy’s situation.</p>
<p>Nodding lightly with a satisfied expression, Yang Kai patted Liu Gui’s shoulder in a friendly manner and praised, “Young man, you have a promising future, be sure to keep on living.”</p>
<p>“Yes yes… many thanks for young master’s praise,” Liu Gui responded with an awkward smile, his expression suddenly changing as he stared at Yang Kai suspiciously.</p>
<p>A moment ago, he felt something go missing from his Knowledge Sea, but after briefly inspecting himself, he couldn’t find anything wrong.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled and explained, “As insurance, I’ll be keeping your Soul brand with me. Don’t divulge anything that happened here after you go back; otherwise, even if we are separated by thousands of kilometers, I can easily put you to death.”</p>
<p>Liu Gui’s face went white and he couldn’t help stumbling backwards a few steps, fumbling for his words as he shouted, “Sou… Soul brand?”</p>
<p>“En. Also, don’t even think of running away, with your Soul brand in hand I can sense your location, if you dare act disloyal in any way… you know the consequences.”</p>
<p>“Yes yes yes, I understand!” Liu Gui nodded his head rapidly. Although he wasn’t sure what Yang Kai had just done to him, he did have a vague feeling he was no longer in control of his own fate.</p>
<p>“Good, I’ll take my leave then!” Yang Kai grinned, his figure flickering and disappearing before Liu Gui could blink.</p>
<p>Liu Gui was once again stunned but soon regained his senses and pointed to his companions who were still unable to move and shouted, “What about them?”</p>
<p>However, he didn’t receive any response.</p>
<p>Liu Gui’s expression fluctuated, becoming somewhat strained.</p>
<p>A moment later, Yang Kai, who was heading towards the Monster Domain, heard a faint series of screams and curses from behind him. Obviously Liu Gui had started ‘processing’ his former compatriots.</p>
<p>Liu Gui was not a good person. That was judged when Yang Kai had seen how he acted. He was clearly the type that would use underhanded schemes and cunning to accomplish his goals. As such, in order to protect his secrets from being leaked out, Liu Gui would naturally silence the witnesses to his crimes. This kind of person was always despicable and shameless.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai needed to arrange a game piece in the enemy’s camp, so he could monitor their movements, and this kind of person who greatly feared death and would do whatever it took to survive was undoubtedly a good candidate.</p>
<p>As for how Liu Gui would explain how he alone survived when the rest of his team was wiped out, that was his problem.</p>
<p>Flying forward, Yang Kai moved as fast a lightning as he followed the directions Xu Hui had given him.</p>
<p>After crossing the great mountain range, Yang Kai quickly felt that he had arrived in a completely different land.</p>
<p>The World Energy that permeated the atmosphere was a bit strange.</p>
<p>Just like in the Demon Land, where the World Energy was mixed with a faint Demonic Qi, a faint Monster Qi filled the Monster Domain’s World Energy aura.</p>
<p>However, regardless of whether it was the Monster Qi or Demonic Qi within the World Energy of either territory, it only existed because the race which lived there had subtly influenced the world around them, causing slight changes in the natural aura.</p>
<p>Beyond the vast mountain range lay an expansive forest.</p>
<p>This place was known as the Beast Sea Jungle and it was the territory of the Monster Race.</p>
<p>Trees which would take several people to surround were everywhere, creating shelter from the hot sun.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had only just entered this place before he noticed a Monster Beast staring at him. Examining it slightly, Yang Kai discovered that this Monster Beast had only reached the Sixth-Order and thus didn’t pay it any mind, continuing forward in hopes he could find a Monster Race person he could communicate with.</p>
<p>But soon, Yang Kai noticed that the Monster Beast he had come across earlier was different from any he had ever encountered before.</p>
<p>It was actually trailing him from a short distance, not rashly launching an attack but instead seemingly monitoring him.</p>
<p>As Yang Kai continued forward, he ran into several other Monster Beasts, all of which began following along with him just like the first one he had come across.</p>
<p>On top of that, this group of Monster Beasts was well organized and disciplined, obviously having a certain degree of sentience even if it wasn’t that high.</p>
<p>Perceiving this, Yang Kai stopped for a moment and attempted to communicate with these Monster Beasts.</p>
<p>Yang Kai actually had a fair amount of experience in this area as he had spent many months communicating with the Divine Tree, allowing him to convey his thoughts relatively clearly to these creatures.</p>
<h2>The most important thing to do now was the patiently communicate with these Monster Beasts that he bore them no malicious intent. Only after Yang Kai managed to accomplish this would the other party not act vigilantly towards him and actively engage in conversation.</h2>
<p>During this process, showing any kind of urgency would only stimulate the other party’s wariness which would be counterproductive.</p>
<p>Somewhere inside the jungle, Yang Kai stood quietly, restraining his aura while integrating himself into the environment, constantly releasing his Divine Sense towards his surroundings, trying to convey his goodwill.</p>
<p>The nearby Monster Beasts silently hid themselves while staring fiercely towards Yang Kai’s position.</p>
<p>Time flowed by but Yang Kai didn’t become anxious.</p>
<p>After half a day’s effort, Yang Kai finally heard the sound of rustling nearby and when he turned his head he saw a giant tiger-like Monster Beast slowly emerge from its hiding place.</p>
<p><em>Sha sha sha…</em></p>
<p>After the first Monster Beast emerged, the others quickly followed suit and soon Yang Kai found himself surrounded.</p>
<p>Yang Kai swept his eyes around and couldn’t help smiling brightly.</p>
<p>These Monster Beasts came in all shapes and sizes but each of them had a grand an imposing appearance and aura.</p>
<p>When they had approached to within a dozen meters or so of Yang Kai, they all stopped and sent out low roars. At the same time, Yang Kai felt that they were trying to communicate something to him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these Monster Beasts’ intelligence was not fully developed so they couldn’t perfectly express their thoughts.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled and then pa.s.sed a message back to them which went something like, “h.e.l.lo everyone, I have no ill intentions in coming here today, you don’t have to worry, I just wish to see your Great Senior. If it is convenient, could you show me the way?”</p>
<p>After sending out this message, the giant tiger-like Monster Beast let out a growl, seemingly asking why Yang Kai wanted to see the Great Senior.</p>
<p>“I have something to discuss with him,” Yang Kai patiently answered.</p>
<p>The Monster Beasts fell into silence, each of them glance around at each other, seemingly unable to make a decision.</p>
<p>After a while, the tiger-like Monster Beast tilted its head back and let out a thunderous roar.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai’s brow furrowed slightly but he didn’t make any attempt to stop it, simply standing there quietly and waiting.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had no idea where the Monster Race Great Senior lived, so right now his only option was to try to get these lower level Monster Beasts to help him.</p>
<p>Immediately after the tiger Monster Beast roared, a second roar deeper into the jungle resounded, then a third, then a fourth, each one getting farther and farther away, as if the message was being relayed over and over again.</p>
<p>Yang Kai blinked at this sight but quickly understood, sitting down next to a big tree and taking out a few bottles of pills from his pocket before tossing their contents out towards the nearby Monster Beasts.</p>
<p>These pills were all made by Yang Kai himself and were for improving the flow of one’s True Qi, allowing them to cultivate more easily.</p>
<p>The surrounding Monster Beasts saw these pills and carefully leaned down to smell them.</p>
<p>Monster Beasts had sharp instincts which allowed them to inherently avoid danger while seeking out opportunity. So, although the grade of these pills weren’t very high, the medicinal aura which leaked from them naturally drew their interest.</p>
<p>Within a few breaths, the pills were s.n.a.t.c.hed up by the Monster Beasts and swallowed down like beans before all of them turned looks of antic.i.p.ation towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Smiling and shaking his head wryly, Yang Kai could only pull out a few more bottles of pills.</p>
<p>Roughly half an hour later, Yang Kai, who had been sitting casually, suddenly wore a solemn expression and looked up towards a certain direction.</p>
<p>From the direction he was staring, Yang Kai sensed an unruly aura rapidly approaching.</p>
<p>On top of that, the strength of this newcomer was definitely not low, at least equivalent to a Third Order Transcendent, or in terms of Monster Beasts, a Peak Seventh-Order!</p>
<p><em>Hong…</em></p>
<p>A burly figure descended from the sky like a meteor, landing directly in front of Yang Kai, throwing up a cloud of dust and causing a shockwave that caused all the giant trees in the surrounding to sway wildly.</p>
<p>The Monster Beasts, who had been quietly waiting with Yang Kai, were frightened and quickly dispersed.</p>
<p>Yang Kai blinked as he stared forward, soon discovering a middle-aged male with a ma.s.sive build about forty years old standing there. The man was looking down at him with eyes filled with scorn and disdain.</p>
<p>This man’s appearance was also quite eye-catching, wearing only some rough animal skins and having thick, messy black hair that blew about in the wind freely.</p>
<p>At first glance, this person appeared like a mad lion, everything about him screaming the word ‘wild’.</p>
<p>[A Monster Race Cultivator!]</p>
<p>Yang Kai immediately determined this man’s ident.i.ty. After receiving the relayed message the Monster Beasts had sent out, this Monster Race powerhouse had obviously immediately rushed over.</p>
<p>This burly man’s eyes were filled with aggression and blood-thirst; what’s more, the once calm and friendly Monster Beasts that had been lying down next to Yang Kai seemed to be infected by this man’s aura and were now baring their fangs while letting out low growls.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t mind however, simply grinning and standing up calmly.</p>
<p>“Human, you dare intrude into the Beast Sea Jungle, your courage is not small!” The middle-aged Monster Race man roared, his Monster Qi condensing as he directed a menacing intent towards Yang Kai. .</p>
<p>“I have some things to do here and would like to ask this friend to give me a moment to explain,” Yang Kai replied with a genial smile.</p>
<p>“Who is your friend!?” The burly Monster Race man shouted, turning his face and spitting before continuing to yell, “Despicable human, my Monster Race can never be friends with you!”</p>
<p>“Ah…” Yang Kai was speechless.</p>
<p>The other party was obviously completely opposed to interacting with him, causing Yang Kai to feel somewhat helpless.</p>
<p>“May I ask Your Excellency’s honoured name?” Yang Kai cupped his fists and asked, not giving up.</p>
<p>“Great Senior has bestowed me the name Kuang s.h.i.+ (Wild Tiger)!” The Monster Race man’s face seemed to glow with pride as he spoke these words, as if it was a great honour for him to have received his name from the Great Senior, coldly snorting in the next instant, “Got it?”</p>
<p>“En, I remember,” Yang Kai nodded seriously.</p>
<p>“Hateful human,” Kuang s.h.i.+ shook his head before asking, “What did you do to my compatriots? Why did them seem so close to you a moment ago?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t do anything to them, I simply gave them some pills,” Yang Kai explained casually, “Don’t worry, they’re just pills that a.s.sist one cultivate, they don’t have any harmful side effects.”</p>
<p>“Pills?” Kuang s.h.i.+’s eyes lit up, apparently quite sensitive to this word.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled and asked, “I have some more of those pills here, does Brother Wild want them? As this is our first meeting, consider them a small gift from me!”</p>
<p>Saying so, Yang Kai took out a few bottles of pills and handed them over.</p>
<p>Kuang s.h.i.+ expression clearly showed he wanted to accept, but there were clear signs of struggle between his brows as well. After smelling the pill fragrance directly though, his desire immediately won out over his reason, reaching out and accepting the pill bottles before grumbling, “Despicable, hateful human, don’t think you can win my approval with these things… En, although, now that I take a closer look, you don’t seem to be too annoying.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai chuckled dumbly despite trying not to; secretly thinking this guy was a bit too pure and innocent.</p>
<p>If everyone from the Monster Race was like this Kuang s.h.i.+, perhaps dealing with them would be easier than Yang Kai antic.i.p.ated.</p>
<p>Checking the bottles of pills, Kuang s.h.i.+ was apparently quite satisfied and carefully put them into his pant pockets, apparently treasuring them greatly.</p>
<p>Curling his lips fiercely, Kuang s.h.i.+ swept his eyes over Yang Kai once and asked, “I heard that you want to see Great Senior?”</p>
<p>He had not asked Yang Kai anything since arriving here so obviously he had received this bit of information from the message the Monster Beasts had pa.s.sed along.</p>
<p>“Good, could Brother Wild possibly introduce me?”</p>
<p>Kuang s.h.i.+ just laughed in response though, “Boy, what do you think my Beast Sea Jungle is? You think you can just casually meet our Monster Race Great Senior? Seeing how respectful you’ve acted so far, I won’t kill you immediately. Quickly go back to wherever you came from. I’ll give you until sunset tonight, if you dare remain here after that, tonight will be the night of your death!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s brow wrinkled slightly as he patiently explained, “Brother Wild, I wish to see your Great Senior in order to discuss some important matters, is there any way you can stretch the rules?”</p>
<p>“Don’t test my patience; you humans never know when to back down. If you irritate me, your end will be very miserable. The Beast Sea Jungle never allows humans to enter, me not attacking you immediately is already a great mercy,” Kuang s.h.i.+ coldly snorted.</p>
<p>Yang Kai just laughed though, “That’s not entirely true, Brother Wild, I’ve heard that a man used to come to your Beast Sea Jungle every now and then to chat and drink with your Great Senior, correct?”</p>
<p>Kuang s.h.i.+’s expression changed greatly as he shouted, “Where did you hear that? Ah… that ring on your hand, why does it look somewhat familiar?”</p>
<p>“Because the man who used to come here wore this ring,” Yang Kai raised his hand and clearly showed the ring on his finger to Kuang s.h.i.+, “You should have heard about the old Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land falling, yes? In a sense, I am his successor! The old Holy Master and your Great Senior shared some friends.h.i.+p, it was for that reason I came here to discuss something with your Great Senior.”</p>
<p>“You are his successor?” Kuang s.h.i.+ couldn’t help widening his eyes as he stared at Yang Kai with amazement, “That guy was very powerful, even able to fight on par with Great Senior, how could his successor be so weak?”</p>
<p>Obviously he looked down on Yang Kai greatly, as if he thought one finger would be enough for him to crush the latter.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t mind though and just continued, “You should know that the old Holy Master brought a lot of Crystal Stones and pills with him each time he came… But now two years have pa.s.sed without any new supplies being brought here, yes? Since I’ve inherited the position of the old Holy Master, in the future, I also plan to bring a number of things here to trade, such as…”</p>
<p>“Such as?” Kuang s.h.i.+ couldn’t help being attracted to this idea.</p>
<p>“For example, those few bottles of pills I just gave you,” Yang Kai smiled.</p>
<p>“Those are already mine!” Kuang s.h.i.+ hastily covered his pocket and stared at Yang Kai vigilantly, fearing he would ask for them back.</p>
<p>“En, naturally those are yours,” Yang Kai nodded lightly, “But if you want any more of those, I first need to speak with your Great Senior. Only after I reach an agreement with your Great Senior can I continue to bring such things here. Aren’t you interested in that?”</p>
<p>Kuang s.h.i.+ lifted his head and stared off into the distance, his brow wrinkling tightly as if he was deep in thought.</p>
<p>After thinking for a while, he scratched his and sighed, “Why do I feel that your words are only half true… Boy, are you trying to deceive me?”</p>
<p>Saying so, he glared directly into Yang Kai’s eyes.</p>
<p>Yang Kai returned his stare, not revealing any signs of anxiety.</p>
<h2>After some brief interaction, Yang Kai understood that although this Kuang s.h.i.+ had achieved a high degree of sentience, like many of the Monster Race, he still mainly relied on his instincts.</h2>
<p>After all, having evolved from Monster Beasts, this was understandable.</p>
<p>This kind of person showed everything they were thinking on their face and would change between happy and angry in an instant. If they felt that you were a good person, they would open up to you and trust you, if you weren’t pleasing to the eye though, they would not hesitate to attack.</p>
<p>Yang Kai actually felt that dealing with this kind of person was quite interesting.</p>
<p>So when he faced Kuang s.h.i.+, he didn’t try to put up any kind of front.</p>
<p>“Good, I’ll lead you to the Thunder Tree Palace, but whether Great Senior will see you is not something I can guarantee,” Kuang s.h.i.+ hesitated for a long time before finally agreeing.</p>
<p>“Many thanks,” Yang Kai sighed with relief and knew that it was the approval of the other party.</p>
<p>Thunder Tree Palace… Although Yang Kai wasn’t familiar with this place, he simply a.s.sumed it was where the Monster Race Great Senior lived.</p>
<p>It was an imposing sounding name.</p>
<p>After agreeing to lead Yang Kai, Kuang s.h.i.+ didn’t waste any time and immediately set off. Along the way he constantly warned Yang Kai to not play any tricks otherwise he would make him suffer.</p>
<p>Each time the subject came up, Yang Kai would promise to not cause trouble.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until now that Yang Kai realized just how vast the Beast Sea Jungle was, and as he flew forward he saw tens of thousands of Monster Beasts living here, from newborn cubs to the Monster Race masters that had achieved human form.</p>
<p>There were only a few Monster Race gatherings of this size throughout the entire Monster Domain and each one had their own Great Senior a.s.suming command.</p>
<p>The Human Territory, Monster Domain, and Demon Land, were not equal in size. The Human Territory was the most extensive, followed by the Demon Land, then finally the Monster Domain.</p>
<p>This Beast Sea Jungle was a whole one-tenth of the entire Monster Domain.</p>
<p>If Yang Kai wanted to travel to Thunder Tree Palace from here, it would take at least three days.</p>
<p>Three days one way meant a six day round trip. While this wasn’t a short amount of time but it also wasn’t too long, so Yang Kai didn’t rush, calmly flying forward, following behind Kuang s.h.i.+ as he appreciated to sights of the Beast Sea Jungle.</p>
<p>Under his Divine Sense’s exploration, Yang Kai discovered numerous types of rare ores, spirit gra.s.s, and spirit medicines which were simply growing wildly in the jungle, no one even attempting to mine or harvest them. Occasionally, some Monster Beasts would directly eat some of the spirit herbs like a cow chewing on gra.s.s. Seeing this, Yang Kai felt an impulse to spit blood.</p>
<p>If he could get his hands on these materials and refine them into pills, their efficacies could be multiplied several times over compared to simple swallowing them.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai knew this was not the time to pursue such matters and simply praised the richness of the Beast Sea Jungle instead.</p>
<p>Of course, the only one around to share these words of praise with was Kuang s.h.i.+. After traveling together for a day, Kuang s.h.i.+ discovered that this human was actually quite easy to get along with and began speaking more opening with him.</p>
<p>After Yang Kai gifted him an artifact that was quite suitable for him to use, Kuang s.h.i.+ immediately became friendly with him.</p>
<p>Giving away a Saint Grade artifact he obtained from the Holy Tomb was naturally impossible; each of them was worth as much as a city and could be called a rare treasure under the Heavens.</p>
<p>Even if Yang Kai was to gift one of these to another, it would have to be someone very close to him.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai had a number of lower grade artifacts on hand. When he had gone to explore the Ancient Ruins deep below the sea with An Ling’er last time, he had collected quite a few, so giving one away here to acquire some favour was no burden to him.</p>
<p>With a new artifact in hand and a few bottles of pills in his pocket, Kuang s.h.i.+ was all smiles.</p>
<p>Now, when Yang Kai called him Brother Kuang or friend, Kuang s.h.i.+ didn’t raise any objections.</p>
<p>As they traversed the Beast Sea Jungle, with Kuang s.h.i.+ leading the way, although they were stopped every now and then by other Monster Race masters, upon hearing that Yang Kai was the new Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land, all of them simply cast him curious glances before allowing them to pa.s.s.</p>
<p>Perhaps, to these Monster Race masters, Nine Heavens Holy Land disappearing was not something they wanted to see.</p>
<p>In the past, the old Holy Master had brought a lot of Crystal Stones, pills, and artifacts which had enriched their lives greatly, so after going two years without any of these, these Monster Race masters were quite anxious to see trade resume.</p>
<p>Three days later, a ma.s.sive tree that towered higher than any he had ever seen before appeared before Yang Kai’s eyes.</p>
<p>This ancient tree was like a mountain, soaring into the sky, innumerable giant branches growing from its immense trunk, and its ma.s.sive canopy casting a shadow more than a dozen kilometers in length.</p>
<p>Yang Kai suddenly came to a halt.</p>
<p>When he first saw this ancient tree, he actually thought his eyes were playing tricks on him, but after carefully examining the scene in front of him, he realized it really was a tree.</p>
<p>It’s just that this tree was too enormous.</p>
<p>The world was truly filled with wonders. Compared to this giant tree, the Divine Tree in Yang Kai’s Black Book s.p.a.ce was like a three-year-old baby.</p>
<p>Kuang s.h.i.+ saw the shocked look on Yang Kai’s face and couldn’t help smiling smugly, “What you’re seeing is the Thunder Tree Palace, the place where Great Senior and the various members of my clan live. Great Senior’s residence is at the very top.”</p>
<p>“Why is it called Thunder Tree Palace?” Yang Kai asked with genuine curiosity.</p>
<p>Kuang s.h.i.+ snorted gruffly and explained, “Thunder Tree Palace is actually a tens of thousands of years old Thunder Swallowing Wood. It is capable of naturally attracting Heavenly Thunder and refining it within its trunk. You must have heard that Great Senior’s original form is the n.o.ble Scarlet Flame Thunder Dragon. Great Senior’s cultivation requires the power of thunder and lightning so this is the perfect place for him to live.”</p>
<p>“It can attract the power of thunder and lightning?” Yang Kai was shocked, “If that’s so, how can others live there?”</p>
<p>“Great Senior’s methods are not something you can comprehend. The power of Heavenly Thunder is absorbed by Great Senior and will thus not affect others who live down below,” Kuang s.h.i.+ proudly explained, “Of course, there are a few others among my clan who need the power of thunder and lightning to cultivate so Great Senior will give a portion to them.”</p>
<p>On the road here, Yang Kai learned that Kuang s.h.i.+ deeply admired this Monster Race Great Senior, any time his name came up in conversation, Kuang s.h.i.+ would show a look of wors.h.i.+p.</p>
<p>So seeing the abundance of pride on his Kuang s.h.i.+’s face right now didn’t even faze Yang Kai anymore, simply nodding and replying, “So that’s how it is, your Great Senior is truly impressive.”</p>
<p>“Naturally,” Kuang s.h.i.+ laughed heartily, “I wonder if I, Kuang s.h.i.+, will be able to reach Great Senior’s height in this life. Good, let’s not discuss this anymore, come with me, we’ll be there soon.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded and quickly followed.</p>
<p>A short time later, the two arrived below the huge ancient tree.</p>
<p>As soon as arrived, from all directions, Yang Kai felt numerous Divine Senses probing him, like a raging torrent, was.h.i.+ng over every inch of his body, seemingly want to inspect him inside and out.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression remained calm, allowing them to scan him all they wanted, not putting up any kind of resistance, and simply staring around indifferently.</p>
<p>Beneath the ancient tree there were many Monster Beasts, each and every one of them possessing a st.u.r.dy body.</p>
<p>Purple-backed blood spider, golden-striped steel turtle, phosphorous green leopard, red-flowered pheasant… all sorts of rare Monster Beasts Yang Kai couldn’t identify had gathered around.</p>
<p>As if awoken by Yang Kai’s appearance, these Monster Beasts all stood up and glared towards him menacingly, their eyes darting back and forth, seemingly communicating with each other.</p>
<p>Yang Kai immediately understood that these Monster Beasts couldn’t be compared to the ones he encountered in the Beast Sea Jungle.</p>
<p>These Monster Beasts all undoubtedly possessed a high degree of intelligence, no worse than Kuang s.h.i.+, and their strengths were also not low, at minimum having reached the Seventh-Order.</p>
<p>Yang Kai secretly guessed that they might not be able to a.s.sume human form or were members of the Monster Race who simply preferred remaining in beast form.</p>
<p>Under the gaze of so many eyes, Yang Kai remained calm and composed, further attracting the attention of these Monster Beasts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, after arriving here, Kuang s.h.i.+ became slightly more restrained, quickly greeting some of his acquaintances here before hurriedly saying to Yang Kai, “You wait here, I’m going to report to Senior Cai Die (Bright b.u.t.terfly); whether or not you can meet Great Senior will be up to her.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently nodded.</p>
<p>Kuang s.h.i.+ then leapt up into the ancient tree, quickly disappearing into its branches.</p>
<p>Yang Kai stood in place like he was told while the surrounding powerful Monster Beasts eyed him like an uninvited guest, obviously not pleased with his appearance.</p>
<p>However, all of this was within Yang Kai’s expectations so he was psychologically prepared.</p>
<p><em>Sha sha sha…</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, a rustling sound came from above his head and a moment later several figures fell down onto some of the lower branches, each of them directing curious and condescending looks towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>When he heard this movement, Yang Kai unconsciously lifted his eyes and couldn’t help feeling shocked.</p>
<p>Naturally, these figures were Monster Race masters who had achieved human form. Each of them was dressed similarly to Kuang s.h.i.+ and gave off a wild aura, all of them still retaining some of their original beast characteristics.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man on the left had a furry tail behind him and a somewhat long neck and beady eyes. It was apparent his original form was some kind of ape.</p>
<p>The woman on the right had a graceful figure and snow white slender legs, her flat belly exposed to the air and some small, sharp tiger teeth showing from the side of her mouth. On top of her head there were also two fluffy triangular ears, indicating her original form was some kind of tiger or a cat.</p>
<p>Yang Kai couldn’t help staring curiously.</p>
<p>These Monster Race masters simply stood atop the nearby branches and observed Yang Kai, seemingly having no intention of causing trouble for him. Each and every one of them remained silent, only the young woman with the cat ears showing an extremely interested look, muttering under her breath, exposing her sharp teeth.</p>
<p>When he met eyes with any of them, Yang Kai would gently nod while the Monster Race masters would simply sneer lightly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a pitiful yell came from high up in the ancient tree. When he heard this yell though, Yang Kai immediately frowned.</p>
<p>Because the one shouting was clearly Kuang s.h.i.+ who had led him here. It seemed like he had been beaten ruthlessly and was now falling.</p>
<p>With a burst of snapping sounds, Kuang s.h.i.+’s burly body broke numerous branches and ripped off countless leaves before smas.h.i.+ng into the ground in front of Yang Kai, directly opening up a large pit.</p>
<p>“You dare bring a human to my clan’s Thunder Tree Palace, Kuang s.h.i.+, are you tired of living? If so, I’ll send you to the afterlife right now!” A tender yet ice cold voice suddenly called out from above. In the next instant, in a flash of multi-coloured light, a pretty figure appeared in front of Yang Kai and gently floated mid-air. Although this woman was clearly reprimanding Kuang s.h.i.+, her beautiful eyes were actually fixed on Yang Kai, a sharp light flas.h.i.+ng across them.</p>
