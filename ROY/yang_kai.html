<h2>Chapter 1276, Detoxification</h2>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>According to Dai Yuan, Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass could not be suppressed by any of the five elements, and now Yang Kai was experiencing this firsthand. The light emanating from Dai Yuan’s body directly penetrated his Knowledge Sea defenses and was even able to somewhat suppress his Conflagrated Spiritual Energy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Dai Yuan had not deliberately been targeting Yang Kai and Yang Kai himself was not an ordinary cultivator. So, although he was a little shocked initially, he was immediately able to resist the influence of this Coloured Glass Divine Light and subsequently release his Conflagrated Divine Sense to envelop Dai Yuan.</p>
<p>Currently, Dai Yuan was experiencing severe pain, causing her already disfigured face to warp into an even more unsightly appearance. However, what Yang Kai found surprising was that her entire body was covered in pockmarks and pustules, completely opposite to an ordinary beautiful woman’s smooth and delicate skin.</p>
<p>Even after disrobing, Dai Yuan’s black undergarments had concealed much of her bare skin from Yang Kai’s sight, but after she entered the Yin Pond, these thing coverings became soaked and clung tightly to her figure. At the same time, Yang Kai was covering her with his powerful Divine Sense, so he immediately discovered this issue.</p>
<p>It seemed that besides her two exposed hands, which seemed to be carved from the finest jade, the rest of Dai Yuan’s body was just like her face, nothing short of unsightly.</p>
<p>The side-effects of this Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art were simply too great! Yang Kai immediately understood that it was Dai Yuan’s special Secret Art that had caused her to become like this.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother Yang...” Just as Yang Kai was slightly distracted, Dai Yuan grit her teeth and shouted tremblingly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai came back to his senses when he heard her voice and nodded, “Let’s begin!”</p>
<p>In the next instant, Dai Yuan completely opened an acupuncture point on her chest and madly began drawing the Yin Pond’s water into her body. When the frigid cold water poured inside her chest, Dai Yuan shuddered uncontrollably, but she still clenched her teeth tightly as her lips went purple and gazed fixedly towards Yang Kai with her beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not say a word, poured his Conflagrated Divine Sense into Dai Yuan’s open acupuncture point, and immediately began forming several sets of Alchemy Spirit Arrays inside her body.</p>
<p>“Conflagrated Divine Sense!” Dai Yuan’s eyes bulged in surprise. She had not expected Yang Kai to possess a Conflagrated Knowledge Sea. According to her original plan, Yang Kai would need to press his hands onto her chest to carefully infuse his Saint Qi into her body, treating it like an Alchemy furnace and using the various medicinal efficacies contained in the Yin Pond’s water to refine then expel the Coloured Glass Toxin.</p>
<p>When discussing the details of this method before, Yang Kai had not disclosed that he possessed a Conflagrated Knowledge Sea, but at this moment, Dai Yuan wasn’t the slightest bit dissatisfied, because since this was the case, Yang Kai wouldn’t need to have any intimate contact with her body.</p>
<p>This shocked her and also put her at bit more at ease; after all, she was an unmarried, innocent young woman. Being touched all over by a young man she wasn’t in love with was naturally not something she wished for.</p>
<p>Just as such thoughts were flashing across Dai Yuan’s mind, centred on her chest’s open acupuncture point, a six-centimetre-wide circle of her skin was flooded with a swirl of the Yin Pond’s water. Under the control of Yang Kai Conflagrated Knowledge Sea, the medicinal efficacies contained in this water were incorporated into Dai Yuan’s flesh, causing an uncomfortable ache to spread from her chest. Dai Yuan’s breathing instantly became laboured as it felt like something had suddenly blocked the flow of her strength in that spot.</p>
<p>Under the effects of the Spirit Arrays Yang Kai had portrayed, however, the various conflicting medicinal efficacies in the Yin Pond’s water blended, then forced a thread of strange glowing material out of Dai Yuan’s chest.</p>
<p>This glowing thread-like object did not dissipate in the Yin Pond though and instead began swirling about without the slightest hindrance.</p>
<p>Soon, another similar thread was forced out, and as time passed, more and more filaments were driven from Dai Yuan’s body, causing the entire Yin Pond to take on a strange luminescence.</p>
<p>After half an hour, Dai Yuan felt the feeling of suffocation in her chest suddenly disappear and her blocked Saint Qi began circulating again. The frigid chill which had originally been difficult for her to resist also no longer caused her any discomfort.</p>
<p>Dai Yuan was overjoyed and could not care about anything else, quickly releasing her Divine Sense to examine her chest.</p>
<p>There was no more Coloured Glass Toxin in the parts of her physique, which was centred on the previously open acupuncture point and her skin had finally been restored to its normal state, taking on a rosy, jade white complexion with none of the previous ugly, pitted areas remaining.</p>
<p>Because she was still soaking in the Yin Pond though, there was a bluish tint to her flesh from the cold, but that could not cover the stark contrast this portion of her body had with the rest of her figure.</p>
<p>Dai Yuan’s eyes nearly teared up and under the trembling of her emotions she almost allowed the Yin Pond’s water to pour into her body unchecked.</p>
<p>“Stabilize your mind and don’t get distracted, you can inspect yourself all you want after everything is finished!” Yang Kai’s firm shout entered Dai Yuan’s ears in the next instant, waking her from her surprise. Glancing over and seeing Yang Kai sitting cross-legged nearby, still pushing his Conflagrated Spiritual Energy into her body to blend the medicinal efficacies for the procedure, his expression calm and steady, not showing the slightest trace of embarrassment, Dai Yuan calmed down, nodded, and opened another of her acupuncture points to draw in the Yin Pond’s water.</p>
<p>Yang Kai immediately coordinated with her, not daring to hesitate!</p>
<p>Under the intense scrutiny of his Divine Sense, although Yang Kai was able to see every part of Dai Yuan’s body, equivalent to her standing in front of him completely naked, at this moment he had not the slightest stray thought, instead focusing all of his attention on meticulously urging the efficacies of the Yin Pond.</p>
<p>Dai Yuan had mixed a large number of herbs into this Yin Pond over the years so it was not difficult to resolve the Coloured Glass Toxin in her body, the tricky part was fusing these medicinal efficacies into Dai Yuan’s physique at a rate she was able to bear.</p>
<p>Fusing the medicinal efficacies into Dai Yuan’s body was not too troublesome as she was an Alchemist as well. So, when Yang Kai used his Conflagrated Divine Sense, she only needed to cooperate with him.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai could do nothing about the speed at which they proceeded as that was completely dependent on Dai Yuan’s own willpower.</p>
<p>The Coloured Glass Toxin had penetrated deep into her body, so every time a part of it was is expelled, not only were the toxins removed, but part of her vital energy was as well. Doing this once or twice was not an issue, but as it was done more and more, Dai Yuan’s life would increasingly be at risk.</p>
<p>The reality of the situation was unfortunately as brutal as they had expected. Every time the toxin was forced out of a section of Dai Yuan’s body, it would take at least a stick of incense worth of time, so after half a day, less than one-fifth of her body had been purified, but Dai Yuan’s aura had already begun to fluctuate and her complexion had grown as pale as paper.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Dai Yuan had fully prepared for this. Taking out some pills from her Space Ring, she tossed them into her mouth and was able to restore some colour to her face.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai also slightly slowed down the movement of his hands, giving her enough time to refine these pills.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai and Dai Yuan did not dare to waste too much time; after all, Dai Yuan experienced enormous consumption for every moment she remained immersed in the Yin Pond. As such, after just a short break, the two began the detoxifying process again.</p>
<p>As time passed by, more and more of the Coloured Glass Toxin in Dai Yuan’s body was expelled, but Yang Kai’s expression only became graver.</p>
<p>He could not see whether Dai Yuan could overcome this challenge, because even now, she was beginning to overdraw her vitality and was barely maintaining her bodily functions and cooperating with Yang Kai on the detoxification. This was not a sustainable situation, and once she could no longer endure, Dai Yuan would definitely die.</p>
<p>Even if she managed to insist, Dai Yuan would end up a convalescent for a long time afterwards.</p>
<p>However, there was no turning back now; whether it was Yang Kai or Dai Yuan, they had no choice but to finish the detoxification one way or the other.</p>
<p>Seemingly feeling the concern in Yang Kai’s gaze, Dai Yuan, who was even now struggling to support herself, suddenly opened her eyes and forced out a smile that was uglier than a grimace and said, “I can handle it, so Junior Brother Yang does not need to have any scruples, please act fully!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai look became solemn, and after feeling her determination, he nodded silently and pushed his Conflagrated Divine Sense even more forcefully, forming a new set of Spirit Arrays inside Dai Yuan’s unguarded body, drawing in the Yin Pond’s water, and cleansing her physique with the medicinal efficacies.</p>
<p>Dai Yuan released pitiful screams again and again, her voice extremely bleak, as if she was suffering inhuman torture.</p>
<p>Another day passed by, and most of Dai Yuan’s body had been restored to its original state. Under the investigation of his Divine Sense, Yang Kai confirmed that she had the capital ordinary women could only dream of. Her skin was jade white and had a mesmerising tenderness to it, while her figure was nothing short of astonishing with rich curves in all the right places, even her pockmarked face had transformed into an alluring vision. Besides her complexion being slightly blue, there was no trace of her former, unbearable appearance and all that remained was a stunning beauty that could ignite a fire in any man’s heart.</p>
<p>Combined with her severely weakened and fragile state, Dai Yuan currently appeared incredibly charming.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had long expected this though, so he was not surprised and continued to focus on the task at hand.</p>
<p>At a certain moment, Yang Kai took back his Conflagrated Divine Sense and shouted vigorously, “Quickly swallow the Blood Invigorating Mushroom!”</p>
<p>Dai Yuan was barely conscious now, her pair of beautiful eyes dull and glazed over. Currently, she only knew how to unconsciously cooperate with Yang Kai’s movements and was relying solely on the obsession in her heart to persist.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after hearing Yang Kai’s shout, a touch of clarity returned to Dai Yuan’s eyes and she swiftly took out the wooden box containing the Blood Invigorating Mushroom from her Space Ring, opened it, and swallowed the contents. Immediately after, she took out the jade bottle Yang Kai had handed her and drank down the medical liquid it contained.</p>
<p>When these precious medicines entered her abdomen, Dai Yuan’s conditional finally began to improve, the paleness on her face was quickly replaced with a strong crimson blush as the blood in her veins began to rapidly circulate. The massive amount of vitality contained in the Blood Invigorating Mushroom began coursing through her body, rapidly restoring the vital energy she had lost.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not wait for her to completely refine the Blood Invigorating Mushroom’s medicinal efficacies before wrapping her in his Conflagrated Divine Sense again.</p>
<p>Success or failure would depend on these final moments. If Dai Yuan’s will was strong enough, she should have a thirty percent chance of making it; if not, she would exhaust her vitality completely and fall.</p>
<p>Dai Yuan understood this better than anyone else and immediately began fully cooperating with Yang Kai.</p>
<p>In an instant, the entire Yin Pond became turbulent as its water madly flooded into Dai Yuan’s body, causing her figure to be enveloped in layers of thick white mist while strange glowing filaments were constantly forced out of her physique.</p>
<h2>1277</h2>
<p>Chapter 1277, Coloured Glass Bead</p>
<p>Thousands of metres below Thousand Illusion Peak’s summit, beside a ten-metre-wide Yin Pond, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, his brow slightly furrowed as he stared at an unremarkable looking grey bead he was playing with in his hand.</p>
<p>Dai Yuan’s detoxification had been completed, and by the Heaven’s grace, she was able to survive and purge all the Coloured Glass Toxin from her body. Currently, she was in a comatose state, but before she fell completely unconscious, she had suddenly opened her mouth and spat out this small bead and told Yang Kai it was a Coloured Glass Bead, then passed out.</p>
<p>Yang Kai brought her out of the Yin Pond, used his Saint Qi to dry the frigid water from her body, then draped his robes over her before settling down nearby.</p>
<p>If possible, Yang Kai wanted to carry her back to her room to rest, but with Dai Yuan currently only wearing tight fitting undergarments, picking her up and holding her close was a bit inconvenient.</p>
<p>There didn’t seem to be anything special about the bead in his hand, and could have been written off as worthless by those who only casually saw it, but as Yang Kai carefully observed this bead, he discovered to his amazement that its interior contained thousands of rays of multi-coloured light that perfectly matched the Coloured Glass Divine Light he had seen before. These rays of light were even capable of suppressing his Divine Sense and penetrating his Knowledge Sea defenses to shake his Soul.</p>
<p>Yang Kai immediately understood that this seemingly ordinary bead was an extraordinary treasure.</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai had not personally seen Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass before, he could tell that the formation of this bead must have something to do with the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass that Dai Yuan had been ingesting to cultivate her Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art. However, after thoroughly inspecting it, Yang Kai discovered something quite strange. While this bead was somewhat like an Alchemy pill, it also had properties resembling an Artifact Refining material. It seemed to be an existence that was situated somewhere between these two, making it difficult to classify.</p>
<p>As he was holding this Coloured Glass Bead appreciatively, Yang Kai expression suddenly changed, and he quickly glanced over towards Dai Yuan who was still lying nearby.</p>
<p>Dai Yuan’s long eyelashes had just fluttered slightly, and her delicate jade fingers seemed to have flexed. Obvious signs that she was about to wake up.</p>
<p>Looking at her completely unrecognizable face, Yang Kai could not help letting out a sigh of admiration. Before purging the Coloured Glass Toxin, Dai Yuan’s appearance had been quite unsightly, but now she had become an extraordinary beauty, even slightly superior to Yin Su Die.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was not confident that if she had such an appearance before she entered the Yin Pond, he would have been able to maintain a completely calm state. Thinking about it carefully, he felt that his heart would have been at least a bit unsteady; after all, what man would be able to remain completely indifferent when facing such an alluring woman when she was nearly naked.</p>
<p>A short time later, Dai Yuan opened her eyes and began to stir, quickly discovering that she was currently very weak.</p>
<p>“Since you’re awake, quickly adjust your breathing, your current state is quite frail,” Yang Kai lightly encouraged.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Dai Yuan moved her gaze and quickly found Yang Kai sitting close to her, looking at her with a smile. Seeing him, she tried to say something, but did not have the strength to form the words.</p>
<p>After discovering that the robes Yang Kai had previously been wearing were missing and that there was something covering her, Dai Yuan’s beautiful eyes flashed a trace of gratitude and security, immediately closing her eyes again and silently circulating a healing art.</p>
<p>Two hours later, Dai Yuan slowly sat up, and after properly dressing herself, she took out many restorative pills she had prepared in advance from her Space Ring and began swallowing them while continuing to meditate.</p>
<p>Another day later, Dai Yuan exhaled deeply and opened her eyes again. This time, her beautiful eyes were full of vitality, and it even seemed that her cultivation had grown. Although her face was still pale, it was no longer moribund; if she continued to meditate, it would only be a matter of time before she completely recovered.</p>
<p>Getting up lithely, Dai Yuan walked over to Yang Kai and bowed deeply, “Dai Yuan thanks Junior Brother Yang. If I had not had Junior Brother Yang’s help this time, I am afraid I would have already fallen. Dai Yuan will never forget Junior Brother Yang’s life saving grace.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai also stood up and shook his head with a smile and said lightly, “It was thanks to your own efforts that you managed to pass through this ordeal, I did not do anything.”</p>
<p>Dai Yuan shook her head slowly, “Junior Brother Yang thinks too highly of me, I know that if I had not sought out Junior Brother Yang but instead asked Grandmaster Xiao or one of the Elders from Medicine Pill Sect, I would definitely not be standing here now. If nothing else, the bottle of medicinal liquid Junior Brother Yang gave me must have been refined from many precious herbs, yes? Without that bottle of medicinal liquid, I would not have been able to endure the last few hours of the detoxification.”</p>
<p>Dai Yuan had clearly felt that after taking the Blood Invigorating Mushroom and the bottle of medicinal liquid, her lost vital energy had been greatly restored, and as time passed, it continued to be supplemented.</p>
<p>It was precisely because of this that she was able to persist until the end. Otherwise, she would have fallen halfway through.</p>
<p>Taking the Blood Invigorating Mushroom directly would not have produced such an effect. If it had been the Blood Mushroom Pill Dai Yuan had taken, such a result would not be unexpected, but simply consuming the Blood Invigorating Mushroom without refining it at all could not achieve this. As such, it was obvious that this long-lasting effect was due to the unknown bottle of medicinal liquid!</p>
<p>Although Dai Yuan did not know what the medicinal liquid Yang Kai gave her had cost him, she was clear that it wasn’t something ordinary. Yang Kai did not even mention this though, showing the depths of his generosity, but how could Dai Yuan not be concerned about it?</p>
<p>Hearing her say this, Yang Kai did not try to deny or confirm anything.</p>
<p>What Dai Yuan did not know was that although the bottle of medicinal liquid had indeed cost Yang Kai a lot of precious spirit herbs, the most important ingredient was actually a drop of his Golden Blood. Yang Kai’s Golden Blood contained an enormous amount of vital energy, which was naturally the best supplement for Dai Yuan’s damaged vitality.</p>
<p>“Regardless of the process, Sister Dai Yuan ultimately succeeded, something worth celebrating! En, congratulations!” Yang Kai let out a laugh as he changed the subject.</p>
<p>A charming smile blossomed on Dai Yuan’s face as she turned around and gazed at her peerless appearance reflected in the calm Yin Pond water, her beautiful eyes flashing a clear and vibrant light.</p>
<p>Yang Kai stood to the side without disturbing her, allowing Dai Yuan to savour the joy of regaining her original beauty.</p>
<p>After a while, Dai Yuan suddenly reached out and waved her sleeve, causing her mesmerizing reflection in the Yin Pond to ripple and disappear.</p>
<p>Immediately, Dai Yuan circulated her Saint Qi and under Yang Kai’s stunned gaze, the beautiful appearance she had just regained reverted back to the ugly pockmarked one she had just rid herself of!</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai could not help frowning slightly.</p>
<p>All women wished to be beautiful, and Dai Yuan was no exception. If that were not the case, she wouldn’t have lost her calm when the Heaven Battling Union disciple had taunted her so back in the Flowing Flame Sand Field, nor would she have revealed such a strong look of nostalgia just now.</p>
<p>However, since she had done this, she must have her own reasons. Yang Kai did not ask anything, but feeling a bit curious, he used his Divine Sense to sweep her face and was amazed to discover that he couldn’t see any flaws in this disguise. It was as if Dai Yuan’s face had really reverted to its former ugly appearance.</p>
<p>This surprised Yang Kai quite a bit; after all, he had seen Dai Yuan’s true face just now with his own eyes.</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai had not asked anything, Dai Yuan took the initiative to explain, “Junior Brother Yang may laugh if he likes. I simply think that now is not a good time to reveal this matter, so I can only conceal it for the time being. It won’t be too late to inform my Honoured Master about this after I break through to the Origin Returning Realm.”</p>
<p>“Sister Dai Yuan has clearly considered this matter carefully,” Yang Kai nodded in agreement before immediately asking, “May I ask Sister Dai Yuan what the use of this bead is?”</p>
<p>Saying so, he took out the Coloured Glass Bead and held it up.</p>
<p>Dai Yuan looked at the Coloured Glass Bead and smiled lightly, “Right, I was only able to take out this bead and didn’t inform Junior Brother Yang about its uses. En, in a sense, to me, this bead is somewhat similar to a Monster Core from a Monster Beast!”</p>
<p>“A Monster Core?” Yang Kai was stunned.</p>
<p>“En, because the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art was created based on how Monster Beast’s cultivate. Junior Brother Yang should know that some Monster Beasts have an innate ability to devour various minerals, extract mineral essence, and then store them in their Monster Core, right? Cultivating the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art imitates this process by taking Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass into my body and producing this bead.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai was truly surprised by this revelation, but quickly realizing a certain point, he hastily asked, “If that is the case, now that you’ve lost this bead, won’t it have a negative effect on you?”</p>
<p>“There is indeed some negative impact, but it’s nothing serious. While it is analogous to a Monster Core, it is not as vital to me as a core would be to a Monster Beast. As long as I have enough time and enough Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass, I can continuously produce such beads.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yang Kai felt relieved while secretly thinking to himself that the master who created this Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art was really a Heaven defying genius. A Secret Art that actually allowed a cultivator to produce a bead similar to a Monster Beast’s Core in their own body. It was no wonder when he was investigating it, Yang Kai had felt it was like an Alchemy pill while also resembling an Artifact Refining material.</p>
<p>Dai Yuan looked at Yang Kai with a smile and exhaled an orchid scent as she continued, “Although this Coloured Glass Bead is important to me, having it or not will not affect me greatly. On the other hand, it will be extremely useful for Junior Brother Yang.”</p>
<p>“Oh? I hope Sister Dai Yuan can explain clearly!” Yang Kai looked at her curiously. He had been investigating this Coloured Glass Bead for quite some time but had yet to figure out what exactly he was supposed to do with it. He had planned on asking Yang Yan, but now that he heard Dai Yuan say this, it would obviously be easier to get an explanation from her.</p>
<p>“If Junior Brother Yang can refine this Coloured Glass Bead, perhaps you will be able to comprehend some of its mysteries; after all, it is formed from concentrated Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass essence. If Junior Brother Yang can comprehend the mysterious of the Coloured Glass Divine Light, it will allow you to obtain a powerful technique to use in battle. With Junior Brother Yang’s aptitude, and the assistance of this Coloured Glass Bead, I would estimate you have an eighty percent chance of success.”</p>
<p>“Coloured Glass Divine Light!” Yang Kai expression brightened. Before, when he was helping Dai Yuan with her detoxification, he had suffered a small loss from this Coloured Glass Divine Light, clearly illustrating the power of this strange multi-coloured light. Ordinarily, without cultivating the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art, no other cultivator had any chance of comprehending how to use Coloured Glass Divine Light, but with the help of this Coloured Glass Bead, such a feat might be possible. Yang Kai was naturally overjoyed to learn this.</p>
<h2>1278</h2>
<p>Chapter 1278, Changes In the Mountain</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>If this was really the case, this gift from Dai Yuan could not be underestimated!</p>
<p>“Junior Brother Yang need not worry, this Coloured Glass Bead is different from the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass I took, it has no toxic side effects. If Junior Brother Yang carefully refines it, there should be no problems. This is the compensation I promised Junior Brother Yang before. Dai Yuan has no other things of real value as all my resources have been spent on preparing for this detoxification. I hope Junior Brother Yang will not refuse.” What Dai Yuan did not tell Yang Kai was that this one Coloured Glass Bead was the result of her diligently cultivating the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art for more than twenty years. Although she had now reached the minor accomplishment stage in this Secret Art and could condense another Coloured Glass Bead, doing so would take several years of effort.</p>
<p>Yang Kai grinned, “I am very satisfied with this reward, Sister Dai Yuan is too considerate.”</p>
<p>Saying so, he put away the Coloured Glass Bead before turning to look at the nearly drained Yin Pond and said, “Since this matter has been settled, we should head back up.”</p>
<p>“En, after so many days of delay, Sister Yang Yan must have grown anxious,” Dai Yuan smiled lightly and led Yang Kai back up to the main cave. It seemed that because she had restored her original appearance, every movement Dai Yuan made now contained a kind of innate charm, completely different from her indifferent aura from before, a fact that secretly surprised Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Not long after, the two returned to the upper cave where they separated and returned to their respective rooms.</p>
<p>After taking out the Coloured Glass Bead and playing with it for a while, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed as he had just thought up something, a grin slowly appearing on his face. At that moment though, the door to his stone room was pushed open and Yang Yan, wrapped in her trademark black robe, walked inside.</p>
<p>“Is everything done?” Yang Yan asked.</p>
<p>“En.”</p>
<p>“Good, then we should leave,” Yang Yan seemed a little anxious but did not ask about what Dai Yuan had wanted Yang Kai to help her with.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Yang Kai frowned.</p>
<p>“Nothing happened, but I don’t think it’s a good idea to remain here for too long. Xiao Xiao has been gone for seven or eight days now so it’s about time for him to come back. Being too greedy may cause unnecessary troubles.</p>
<p>Yang Kai thought about it for a moment and felt what Yang Yan said made sense, nodding in agreement, “Alright. Then, we’ll leave in the morning.”</p>
<p>Although they were still inside Thousand Illusion Peak, Yang Kai could investigate the situation outside with his Divine Sense. It was the middle of the night right now so leaving would be inconvenient so he could only wait for dawn before setting out.</p>
<p>After reaching an agreement, Yang Yan also returned to her room to rest.</p>
<p>After a peaceful night, Yang Kai immediately informed Dai Yuan about his intention to leave. Although Dai Yuan enthusiastically invited Yang Kai to stay a few more days, hoping to discuss their shared interest in Alchemy, with Yang Kai having a guilty conscience at the moment, how could he continue to linger? Seeing that there was no way to persuade him, Dai Yuan reluctantly agreed and personally saw Yang Kai and Yang Yan out of Grand Crystal Mountain Range.</p>
<p>On the way, Dai Yuan told Yang Kai that after taking a few months to fully recover, she would enter retreat to break through to the Origin Returning Realm. Once she succeeded, she would visit Dragon Cave Mountain again to thank him in person!</p>
<p>Yang Kai naturally agreed.</p>
<p>While the two were talking, a thunderous sound suddenly spread across the entire Grand Crystal Mountain Range and immediately after, a beam of multicoloured light shot up into the sky. Even though they were thousands of kilometres away, the group of three were still able to see this beam of light clearly.</p>
<p>“Coloured Glass Mountain!” Dai Yuan’s expression changed dramatically as she stared towards the beam of multi-coloured light and exclaimed. The spot where this beam originated from was obviously where Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Mountain was situated. Seeing this situation, it seemed that the grand Spirit Array arranged around Coloured Glass Mountain had become unstable, allowing Coloured Glass Mountain’s Coloured Glass Divine Light to break through.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face also changed slightly as he and Yang Yan exchanged a knowing glance, the two of them having a myriad of thoughts flash across their minds. But soon, Yang Kai restored a calm expression and asked, “Did something happen with your noble Sect’s Coloured Glass Mountain?”</p>
<p>“En, I don’t know exactly what’s happened, but it seems that the barrier surrounding it was somewhat triggered. Junior Brother Yang, I originally wanted to send you all the way, but it appears I will not be able to accompany you any further. Since I cultivate the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art, I must immediately head out. I will have to say goodbye to you and Sister Yang Yan here!”</p>
<p>“Since such a big event has occurred in your noble Sect, Sister Dai Yuan truly should respond promptly. We’ve already arrived at the edge of Grand Crystal Mountain Range, so as long as Yang Yan and I follow the path, we shouldn’t have any problems leaving,” Yang Kai gently nodded.</p>
<p>“Thank you. One day, I will surely patronize your Dragon Cave Mountain. At that time, I hope we can have a long discussion,” Dai Yuan smiled apologetically before her tender body flickered and transformed into a stream of light, returning along the path they had just flown at a very fast speed.</p>
<p>After her figure disappeared, Yang Kai pulled Yang Yan’s hand and shouted, “Let’s go!”</p>
<p>The two also summoned their Star Shuttles and quickly took off. Although they did not know what had happened, Yang Kai was certain it was related to the Stone Puppet, so how could they foolishly remain any longer?</p>
<p>After all, there was an accident when he had retrieved the Stone Puppet last night.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they had decided to leave today, otherwise with such a development happening right now, Yang Kai and Yang Yan would have had a hard time trying to leave Coloured Glass Sect. With Dai Yuan acting as a guarantor, he wasn’t worried that any harm would come to them inside Coloured Glass Sect; however, if any kind of clue had been left behind that could trace back to them, the Coloured Glass Sect would definitely not let them go, no matter how Dai Yuan advocated for them.</p>
<p>At the same time, beside Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Mountain that Yang Kai had seen from afar before, dozens of Origin Returning Realm masters were on high alert. Among them, there were at least ten Third-Order Origin Realm masters, all of them releasing an incredible momentum.</p>
<p>Half of these masters were shuttling back and forth around Coloured Glass Mountain, constantly pouring streams of pure Saint Qi into a translucent energy barrier. Receiving so much Saint Qi, this great barrier fluctuated visibly and released a series of big and small ripples that gave off a strong suppressive power. These ripples were gradually suppressing the Coloured Glass Divine Light that was shooting up into the sky back into the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Mountain. As for the remaining Origin Realm masters, they all had their Saint Qi condensed as they stared solemnly at the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Mountain, preparing to act at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>“What happened!” A booming voice suddenly resounded as an old man with a thin figure, silver hair, and a long beard appeared beside Coloured Glass Mountain.</p>
<p>Many Origin Returning Realm masters saw this old man and immediately cupped their fists, “Greetings, Sect Master!”</p>
<p>This old man was the Sect Master of Coloured Glass Sect, Gong Xing He.</p>
<p>Gong Xing He just waved his hand, motioning for everyone to dispense with the formalities as he turned his gaze towards a pair of Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters who were rapidly flying over.</p>
<p>The man appeared middle-aged and had an imposing stature. Although it was impossible to tell his exact age, the vicissitudes which permeated his eyes clearly indicated he was not young. As for the woman, she had the appearance of a beautiful middle-aged woman with a slender figure that while a bit older was still quite charming.</p>
<p>The pair arrived in front of Gong Xing He and respectfully greeted him.</p>
<p>“Elder Ma, Elder Du, the two of you have been defending this place for years, what happened just now?” Gong Xing He looked at them and asked with a solemn expression.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man surnamed Ma and the beautiful woman surnamed Du exchanged a quick glance before the man cupped his fists and replied, “Reporting to Sect Master, the situation is like this. Last night, for some unknown reason, Elder Du suddenly felt that the grand barrier below Coloured Glass Mountain seemed to show some signs of loosening. I immediately sent the Mountain Quarrying Beast to investigate, but soon after I unexpectedly lost contact with it. Even now, it has still not responded to my attempts to communicate with it or returned on its own. Then, just now, the Coloured Glass Divine Light suddenly erupted. The two of us believe that a section of the barrier underground has been damaged, otherwise this kind of matter could not have occurred.”</p>
<p>“The barrier has been damaged?” Gong Xing He frowned, quickly asking, “This has not happened in hundreds of years. Every few years we stabilize the Spirit Array and barrier, so how could it suddenly have become damaged?”</p>
<p>“This...” The man surnamed Ma hesitated for a while, unable to offer an explanation.</p>
<p>Seeing him behave like this, Gong Xing He naturally knew that inquiring further would be pointless and instead turned to the beautiful woman and asked, “Elder Du, do we only have one Mountain Quarrying Beast available?”</p>
<p>The beautiful middle-aged woman smiled bitterly, “We indeed have more than one Mountain Quarrying Beast, but only one is capable of withstanding the intensity of the Coloured Glass Divine Light close to the Coloured Glass Mountain’s barrier, the others aren’t mature enough yet. These beasts were purchased specially from Myriad Beast Sect for the purpose of guarding Coloured Glass Mountain but Myriad Beast Sect has not given us the complete method to cultivate and control them.”</p>
<p>“So, we have no way of finding out what happened to the barrier below Coloured Glass Mountain in its current condition?” Gong Xing He immediately looked displeased.</p>
<p>The man surnamed Ma and the beautiful woman surnamed Du hung their heads down without saying a word.</p>
<p>“Do we have any idea what could have caused this?” Gong Xing He asked again.</p>
<p>The two Elders’ expressions became even more awkward.</p>
<p>Seeing this situation, another Elder nearby said, “Although we don’t know if the barrier was damaged as a result of some natural phenomenon or if it was damaged artificially, the most important thing right now is to suppress the outbreak of the Coloured Glass Divine Light. If we allow things to continue like this, the entire Spirit Array might collapse, and we might lose this treasure mountain. While we suppress the outbreak here though, we must thoroughly investigate all the outsiders who entered Coloured Glass Sect recently. If this was not some kind of accident, it may be related to one of these outsiders.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” A number of others immediately agreed.</p>
<p>Gong Xing He pondered for a moment before turning to look at the Elder who had spoken just now and nodded, “I leave it to you to investigate the outsiders in the Sect right now, don’t allow any of them to leave Coloured Glass Sect but also don’t embarrass them. If it really was one of them, they must have been after the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass. Good! I want to see just who has the guts to try something so audacious!”</p>
<p>“Yes!” The Elder received this order and immediately went to work.</p>
<p>Not far away, when Yin Su Die overheard all this, she suddenly smiled and quickly chased after this Elder, seemingly wanting to report something.</p>
<p>At the same time, another graceful young woman wearing a gorgeous dress walked up to Gong Xing He and said, “Sect Master, please restrain your anger. In fact, there is another method besides the Mountain Quarrying Beast to investigate what has happened with the barrier down below.”</p>
<h2>1279</h2>
<p>Chapter 1279, It Really Was You</p>
<p>Seeing this young woman speak, Gong Xing He squinted slightly before nodding, “Fu’er, explain. What other solution do you have?”</p>
<p>The young woman smiled and said, “Did father forget? Among my disciples, there is one who has cultivated the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art.”</p>
<p>The young woman and Gong Xing He shared a father-daughter relationship, but both were Third Order Origin Returning Realm masters. This situation was not uncommon on Shadowed Star though, because the Third Order Origin Returning Realm was the limit a cultivator could achieve here. As such, within many great Sects, multiple generations of the same family, as well as many Masters and Disciples could have the same cultivation.</p>
<p>From the way Gong Xing He addressed this young woman and from the words she spoke, it was apparent that she was the one Dai Yuan mentioned to Yang Kai, Gong Ao Fu of Myriad Crystal Peak.</p>
<p>“Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art...” Gong Xing He heard these words and could not help a trace of fear from flashing across his eyes. The other Elders present were also the same, all of them seemingly remembering something with complex expressions.</p>
<p>“You mean the Junior who currently lives on Thousand Illusion Peak?” Gong Xing He’s eyes quickly returned to normal and he asked lightly.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Gong Ao Fu nodded.</p>
<p>“Where is she?” Gong Xing He asked.</p>
<p>“It seems that she’s already on her way here, probably because she noticed the situation,” Gong Ao Fu turned her head towards a certain direction where an azure streak of light was quickly approaching.</p>
<p>After waiting for a moment, the azure light arrived in front of everyone and a graceful figure revealed itself.</p>
<p>However, when everyone saw the face of this figure, many strange expressions appeared.</p>
<p>The one who had arrived was naturally Dai Yuan, but obviously having anticipated that many of the Sect’s Elders would already be here, she didn’t show any signs of panic and greeted Gong Xing He with a calm expression, “Thousand Illusion Peak disciple Dai Yuan greets Sect Master!”</p>
<p>Gong Xing He gently nodded but did not say anything.</p>
<p>Dai Yuan next saluted Gong Ao Fu and the other Elders who had gathered.</p>
<p>Gong Ao Fu Dai frowned slightly as she used her Divine Sense to sweep Dai Yuan, suspiciously asking, “Yuan’er, what have you been up to these past few days? Why does it look like your vitality is slightly damaged?”</p>
<p>Dai Yuan bowed her head and replied, “Disciple had a slight accident while cultivating, but it has not caused any lasting harm. Many thanks for Honoured Master’s concern.”</p>
<p>Although her words were polite, Dai Yuan’s expression was completely indifferent, as if she was only making the appropriate replies without any emotion behind them.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Gong Xing He knit his brow slightly, but not caring about her attitude, he quickly asked, “Your Honoured Master said that you have a way to investigate the situation below Coloured Glass Mountain, is this the case?”</p>
<p>“Investigate below Coloured Glass Mountain?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we suspect that the underground barrier has been damaged, but we are unable to tell if it was some kind of natural occurrence or if it was done intentionally, so we need to check it. Is there any problem?”</p>
<p>“The Sect raised and nurtured me, so now that I can be of use to it, Dai Yuan will naturally cooperate!” Dai Yuan replied faintly.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Gong Ao Fu opened her mouth and seemed to want to say something, but thinking twice, she simply said, “Since that is the case, investigate the situation and report back to us.”</p>
<p>“Disciple understands!” Dai Yuan did not hesitate, immediately closing her eyes and circulating her Secret Art. Soon, Coloured Glass Divine Light identical to the one bursting from Coloured Glass Mountain burst from Dai Yuan’s body, the only difference was the light from her was less than a millionth in intensity. This halo of Coloured Glass Light surrounded Dai Yuan for a moment before suddenly condensing into a ray that shot into the ground below Coloured Glass Mountain.</p>
<p>Seeing this situation, many Elders who had never witnessed the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art in action showed looks of interest. Because Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Mountain could not be suppressed by the five elements and also had the effect of restraining Spiritual Energy, even if their cultivation realms were much higher than Dai Yuan’s, they were unable to use their Divine Senses to investigate the situation below Coloured Glass Mountain.</p>
<p>But now, Dai Yuan, who was just a Third Order Saint King, was easily able to accomplish this feat, stimulating their curiosity.</p>
<p>Naturally, they understood the dangers of cultivating the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art, so while they were curious about its effects, none of them had any intent to practice it, most of them soon just waiting for Dai Yuan to finish her investigation.</p>
<p>Sometime later, a ray of light shot up from below Coloured Glass Mountain and rushed into Dai Yuan’s tender body.</p>
<p>Seeing this situation, the gathered Elders of Coloured Glass Sect looked to Dai Yuan and waited for her answer.</p>
<p>However, Dai Yuan kept her eyes closed tightly, as if she was perceiving something. It was only after quite a while passed that she opened her eyes and bowed, “Reporting to Sect Master, Honoured Master, the barrier beneath Coloured Glass Mountain has indeed been damaged, and nearby where the damage is there seems to be the corpse of a Monster Beast. It looks as if this Monster Beast touched the barrier and was killed by it, damaging it in the process.”</p>
<p>“A Monster Beast?” The beautiful woman surnamed Du was shocked and could not help asking, “Could it be the Mountain Quarrying Beast?”</p>
<p>“It can’t be,” The man surnamed Ma also looked puzzled, “The Mountain Quarrying Beast shouldn’t have damaged the barrier. It has already performed many investigations around the mountain and never once had any trouble, why would it suddenly make such a grave mistake?”</p>
<p>The beautiful woman surnamed Du looked at Dai Yuan and asked with a faint smile, “Martial Niece, could you have been mistaken? The Mountain Quarrying Beast was specially purchased from Myriad Beast Sect to be used here and should not have broken the barrier.”</p>
<p>“I can’t be certain what happened, I only reported what I was able to see. If Elder Du does not believe me, you should find some other ways to investigate the situation.” After Dai Yuan said a few words, her face became quite pale. Using the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art just now had exhausted her greatly.</p>
<p>The beautiful woman surnamed Du smiled with embarrassment and did not say anything more. If they had a way to check the situation carefully, how could they have needed to use Dai Yuan’s ability? It was more so that since she and Elder Ma had been guarding Coloured Glass Mountain when this problem had occurred, they would inevitably have to bear some responsibility.</p>
<p>“Since it was the fault of the Mountain Quarrying Beast, this issue isn’t complicated. What we need to do now is patch the Spirit Array. Since the barrier underground has been damaged, we need to find some way to repair it remotely or compensate for the breakage,” Gong Xing He flashed a thoughtful look on his face but did not ask Dai Yuan any further questions.</p>
<p>“Father... Since this problem was caused by the Mountain Quarrying Beast, should we still investigate the outsiders currently inside the Sect?” Gong Ao Fu glanced over at Dai Yuan when she asked this question, apparently having heard from Yin Su Die a few days ago that Dai Yuan had brought guests back with her.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave responsibility for this matter to you!” Gong Xing He waved his hand before turning around and flying off, his figure quickly disappearing.</p>
<p>After the Sect Master left, many Elders could not help secretly breathing a sigh of relief. Elder Ma and Elder Du soon exchanged a glance, the former saying, “Although according to the investigation by Martial Niece Dai Yuan, the barrier was not damaged by an outsider, something about this situation feels slightly off. Elder Du has been cultivating that Mountain Quarrying Beast for more than thirty years and has never made any mistakes, yet this time there was an accident. Perhaps there is something more to this incident we are not aware of yet.”</p>
<p>Everyone who heard this naturally understood that these two were trying to deflect responsibility. If this incident was the result of an outsider’s meddling, the responsibility borne by Elder Ma and Elder Du would naturally be lighter. As such, Elder Du immediately took the initiative to launch a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Elder Ma could not feign lack of involvement and naturally cooperated fully with Elder Du to check all the outsiders who had recently arrived in the Sect.</p>
<p>On the other side, Dai Yuan came over to Gong Ao Fu with a pale face and bowed politely, “Honoured Master, disciple will take her leave now.”</p>
<p>“En, good, you’ve worked hard. The damage to your vitality this time has not been light; Before you reach the minor accomplishment stage in the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art, you must avoid using the Coloured Glass Divine Light as much as possible. Return to Thousand Illusion Peak and take a good rest for the next few months. Take this bottle of Hundred Gauze Pills, it should be able to help you restore some of your lost strength.” Saying so, Gong Ao Fu threw a bottle of pills to Dai Yuan.</p>
<p>Dai Yuan took it, expressed her gratitude, then departed respectfully. Gong Ao Fu asking her to take a few months to recuperate was exactly what Dai Yuan wished for. She originally intended to spend several months recovering her strength before attempting to break through to the Origin Returning Realm.</p>
<p>While the Coloured Glass Sect Elders busied themselves repairing the grand Spirit Array around Coloured Glass Mountain, Dai Yuan returned to Thousand Illusion Peak. Once there, she headed straight to the room where Yang Kai had been living.</p>
<p>Standing inside this room and looking around, Dai Yuan’s beautiful eyes flashed a touch of uncertainty.</p>
<p>After a brief hesitation, Dai Yuan pushed her Saint Qi and released the Coloured Glass Divine Light from her body again, condensing it into a ball she then sent underground. Closing her eyes, Dai Yuan carefully investigated the situation down below before suddenly shivering slightly as a look of shock appeared on her face, murmuring under her breath in the next month, “It really was you!”</p>
<p>She had noticed earlier when she was exploring the situation with Coloured Glass Mountain that a small tunnel had been dug beneath it. On top of that, the interior of Coloured Glass Mountain seemed to have been hollowed out somewhat and a great deal of Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass was missing.</p>
<p>However, while following this small underground tunnel, Dai Yuan was shocked to discover that it actually led off towards Thousand Illusion Peak!</p>
<p>Although the entire tunnel had been deliberately covered up, there were still some slight traces left behind. Under the Coloured Glass Divine Light’s investigation, these traces became quite noticeable.</p>
<p>Shocked at the time, Dai Yuan did not dare to report everything she had seen because she vaguely felt that this matter might have something to do with Yang Kai. At that time, it was just a hunch, but to make sure there were no accidents she pushed the blame for the incident onto the Mountain Quarrying Beast. However, Dai Yuan could tell that the Mountain Quarrying Beast had not been killed by the barrier at all. Instead, it looked as if it had been patted to death by some kind of blunt object.</p>
<p>Now that she had returned to Thousand Illusion Peak and investigated, Dai Yuan was immediately able to verify her suspicions.</p>
<p>Beneath the room where Yang Kai had been staying, there were identical traces of a small tunnel leading towards Coloured Glass Mountain.</p>
<p>In recent years, Dai Yuan had only received two guests on Thousand Illusion Peak, Yang Kai and Yang Yan, so it only made sense that this was their doing.</p>
<p>Dai Yuan did not know what kind of magical method Yang Kai had used to dig a tunnel from here to Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Mountain then extract a large amount of Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass completely undetected, however, she knew if this matter ever came to light, Yang Kai would be hunted down Coloured Glass Sect. His method of collecting Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass without using the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art was something the Elders of the Sect would not be willing to let go of.</p>

<p>Fortunately, only Dai Yuan cultivated the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art, so even the Sect Master wouldn’t be able to discover anything was amiss unless the entire Coloured Glass Mountain was moved. Having pushed the blame onto the Mountain Quarrying Beast, Dai Yuan was confident that Yang Kai wouldn’t be subject to any doubt.</p>
<p>At this point, Dai Yuan felt strangely calm in her heart as she decided to bury this matter permanently and not tell another soul about it. She even took some time to completely erase all traces of the small tunnel deep underground leading to the room where Yang Kai had lived.</p>
<p>Yang Kai hadn’t thought that Dai Yuan would actually have a method to uncover his little scheme. He thought everything had gone smoothly with no one being the wiser.</p>
<p>Before he and Yang Yan left, Yang Kai made the Stone Puppet destroy the underground tunnel, but both of them had apparently underestimated the power of the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art and the Coloured Glass Divine Light.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yang Kai and Yang Yan were already a hundred thousand kilometres away from Grand Crystal Mountain Range and were flying towards a certain destination.</p>
<p>But Yang Kai still felt a slight sense of discomfort so with a solemn look he released his Divine Sense to investigate the situation nearby.</p>
<p>“Why do you seem on edge?” Yang Yan asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“En, when the Stone Puppet returned, it mentioned it encountered a strange Monster Beast. Although it was only a Sixth-Order Monster Beast and the Stone Puppet instantly patted it to death, the change in Coloured Glass Mountain must be related to this. I don’t know if that Monster Beast was able to pass any information back to its master. If it did, we need to pick up our pace.”</p>
<p>“Xiao Xiao killed a Monster Beast?” Yang Yan exclaimed; she had only just learned about this matter.</p>
<p>“It should be a Monster Beast specially raised by Coloured Glass Sect. I don’t know what species it was, only that it was able to ignore the barriers under Coloured Glass Mountain. It was probably released by the Elders of Coloured Glass Sect to investigate the underground situation. Fortunately, the Stone Puppet acted swiftly and killed it before it had time to react; otherwise, I’m afraid things would have become troublesome...”Just as he said these words, Yang Kai raised his head and stared up ahead, narrowing his eyes slightly.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“Someone is coming this way,” Yang Kai squinted as he continued to stare forward, a thoughtful look appearing on his face.</p>
<p>Yang Yan also looked in the direction Yang Kai was staring, but she was unable to discover anything. However, knowing that Yang Kai was different from ordinary people, she wasn’t surprised that he sensed something she couldn’t and simply asked lightly, “Are they after us?”</p>
<p>If someone was pursing them from Coloured Glass Sect, they should have appeared behind them, so why were they coming from the front?</p>
<p>“It’s Yin Su Die! It seems they really are targeting us,” Yang Kai smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>Yang Yan thought about it for a moment before suddenly saying, “Coloured Glass Sect must have a Space Array that is connected to the nearby city, otherwise this situation would be impossible. What should we do?”</p>
<p>“What else can we do? If we try to avoid them it would be like admitting we’re guilty,” Yang Kai shook his head; he decided to pretend he hadn’t discovered that some people were approaching and prepared to openly meet them.</p>
<p>Because he found that Yin Su Die, while not alone, wasn’t accompanied by an Origin Returning Realm master, Yang Kai wasn’t afraid to meet her.</p>
<p>At a position a few hundred kilometres ahead, Yin Su Die and two other Third-Order Saint King cultivators were flying towards Yang Kai with a faint trace of satisfaction apparent on her face. Before, when she heard the Sect Master order a thorough investigation of all the visitors to the Sect, Yin Su Die rejoiced; after all, she had suffered a small loss when she used her Beguiling Technique on Yang Kai a few days ago, allowing him to take advantage of her and stirring up a great deal of resentment in her heart.</p>
<p>Without even mentioning this though, Yang Kai being a guest of Dai Yuan alone was enough to stimulate Yin Su Die. She had been worried that she would be able to find an opportunity to make trouble for Yang Kai, but such an opportunity had actually presented itself much faster than she anticipated.</p>
<p>She was quite interested in what kind of relationship Dai Yuan and Yang Kai shared and what purpose she had for inviting Yang Kai back to Thousand Illusion Peak this time.</p>
<p>However, how could Yin Su Die have imagined that this so-called thorough investigation of all outsiders was just loud thunder with light rain? When she had reported to the Elder in charge of this investigation that Yang Kai was just a Second-Order Saint King, they had immediately lost any interest and didn’t have any intention of sending out a pursuit team. However, the Elder also seemed to understand Yin Su Die had her own motives for this so they didn’t prevent her from taking some people to chase after Yang Kai.</p>
<p>As such, Yin Su Die recruited two relatively strong helpers then used Coloured Glass Sect’s Space Array to travel to a city roughly one hundred thousand kilometres away.</p>
<p>Of the two cultivators Yin Su Die brought with her, one of them had a burly figure and bulging muscles which he exposed with his sleeveless robes named Hou Jian. This man looked like a great bear that possessed immense physical strength and constantly had a malevolent look upon his face, giving him a cruel impression.</p>
<p>But when this menacing man looked at Yin Su Die, his face filled with tenderness, and when he spoke to her, he also deliberately lowered his voice, seemingly afraid he would frighten this beautiful woman.</p>
<p>The other man Yin Su Die recruited, named Luo Min, wore refined robes and had a dignified face, giving him an intelligent and handsome appearance. At this moment, a light seemed to flash across the depths of his eyes as he continuously scanned his surroundings searching for something. With his pair of eyes, nothing within a radius of a hundred kilometres could escape his vision.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother Luo, have you found them yet?” The burly man suddenly glanced over at the other person and asked, “You’ve been looking for so long yet haven’t discovered any clues yet, are you even trying?”</p>
<p>“What are you implying?” Luo Min heard his burly companion’s question and immediately wore a displeased look upon his face, “They left Grand Crystal Mountain Range some time ago, and although we managed to get in front of them, who knows which direction they went? If Senior Brother Hou doesn’t feel relieved, you can try searching for them yourself. I heard that Senior Brother has recently put a lot of effort into cultivating his Divine Sense, this is a good opportunity to see the results of your training! It seems Master even rewarded Senior Brother with a bottle of Clear Spirit Pills, so presumably Senior Brother’s Divine Sense is much stronger than before, yes?”</p>
<p>Listening to the ridicule in this Junior Brother Luo’s voice, Hou Jian’s face immediately became gloomy. His Secret Art didn’t pay much attention to the growth of his Soul and it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that it was his biggest shortcoming. As his strength had grown, this shortcoming had become more and more obvious and some time ago, he had been forced to start single-mindedly cultivating his Spiritual Energy.</p>
<p>Now that this sore spot had been pointed out by his Junior Brother, and in front of the beauty he was pursing no less, Hou Jian couldn’t help feeling annoyed. The two of them, as fellow brothers, usually didn’t have any kind of friction between them, but now, in front of Yin Su Die, a kind of rivalry inevitably arose.</p>
<p>Seeing the face of the burly Hou Jian became dark, as if his anger was about to erupt, Yin Su Die quickly said, “Two Senior Brothers, please don’t quarrel. This time, I asked both of you to come out because I needed to borrow both of your strengths. Senior Brother Lou cultivates the Farsight Spirit Eye Technique which is necessary to find the people we’re looking for, but after finding them, Senior Brother Hou’s strength is necessary to capture them. Two Senior Brothers both know about the incident with the Sect’s most precious treasure, the Coloured Glass Mountain, and understand that the Elders suspect that it may have been caused by an outsider, yes? That man surnamed Yang leaving right at this moment is clearly suspicious, so we absolutely cannot let him escape.”</p>
<p>Yin Su Die didn’t show any annoyance at being competed over by these two men, even seemingly enjoying them clamouring for her attention, but right now, tracking down Yang Kai was her top priority, so she spoke to persuade them.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Hou Jian expression became somewhat more serious, seemingly taking Yin Su Die at her word and asking, “Then, was that incident really some kind of plot that brat set up?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Yin Su Die smiled and shook her head. “But this matter is of great importance. Anyone who is even slightly suspicious can’t be let off. We must capture him and bring him back to the Sect Elders. Afterwards, it will be up the Elders to decide if he is guilty or innocent!”</p>
<p>By saying it was all the Elders’ orders, how could these two men refuse? However, Yin Su Die’s rhetoric was only able to confuse the muscle headed Hou Jian while the Luo Min thought otherwise. He clearly knew there was more going on here but he didn’t dare expose this truth.</p>
<p>For him, looking for someone was just a trifling matter; the important thing was that doing so allowed him to please Yin Su Die.</p>
<p>“Good good good, Junior Brother Luo, look again carefully, once you find that little brat, Senior Brother will make sure to capture him. Hmph, daring to have ideas about our Coloured Glass Mountain, I must see if this brat has the guts!” Declaring so, Hou Jian flashed a terrifying grin.</p>
<p>Just as Luo Min was about to make another snide comment, he suddenly glanced in a certain direction and shouted, “I found them!”</p>
<p>“Where?” Yin Su Die wore a look of happiness and hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“That way, they’re coming towards us!” Luo Min pointed his finger and said with confidence, “It’s exactly as Junior Sister described, a young man and a woman with the woman wearing all black robes. It’s definitely them.”</p>
<p>“So it seems.” Yin Su Die smirked.</p>
<p>“Interesting, they’re actually coming right to us!” Hou Jian struck his chest and shouted, “Senior Brother will go on ahead, Junior Brother Luo, you protect Junior Sister. This won’t take long!”</p>
<p>When Luo Min heard this, he knew that his Senior Brother was trying to grab some credit; after all, he had been the one to discover them, so if he went forward to capture them now, Hou Jian would have come along for nothing. Nevertheless, Luo Min felt it was a good opportunity to enjoy some time alone with Yin Su Die so he didn’t bother objecting, smiling and saying, “Senior Brother Hou is still so impatient. Good, Junior Sister, let’s take our time. Presumably, by the time we arrive, Senior Brother Hou will have finished up everything; after all, how could a trivial Second-Order Saint King raise any fuss?”</p>
<p>Yin Su Die eyes flashed slightly, seemingly thinking of something, but quickly nodded as if nothing happened and said, “That’s true. Fortunately, I asked Senior Brother Luo to come along this time, otherwise, it would have been quite troublesome to find these two.”</p>
<p>“Junior Sister is far too polite, if you ever have a need for Senior Brother’s help in the future, all you need to do is ask and Senior Brother will surely not refuse. Junior Sister’s Myriad Crystal Peak is also not far from our Swift Bird Peak, so if another day Junior Sister has time, it would be Senior Brother’s honour to receive her. Senior Brother promises to provide the finest of entertainment should Junior Sister decide to visit.” Luo Min took this chance to send out an invitation, expressing as much admiration and affection as he dared to.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yin Su Die let out a giggle and gave him a perfunctory answer. Although Luo Min understood this, just seeing Yin Su Die smile at him and being able to listen to her silver-bell-like laughter was enough for him to become somewhat absentminded. In the next instant, he shook his head slightly and focused his blurry vision as he felt a chill in his heart, understanding that this Junior Sister of his had once again made progress in her Beguiling Technique. He had also heard that as long as Grandmaster Xiao finished refining an Origin Condensing Pill for her, Yin Su Die would be able to break through to the Origin Returning Realm. Now, it seemed those rumours were true.</p>
<h2>1281</h2>
<p>Chapter 1281, Kneel Down</p>
<p>Yang Kai wore a strange look as he stared at the burly man with an indifferent expression who had flown over and intercepted them.</p>
<p>This burly figured was naturally Hou Jian who had been recruited by Yin Su Die, but what Yang Kai didn’t understand was why this man had rushed over all alone while Yin Su Die and another cultivator seemed to be taking their time catching up.</p>
<p>Hou Jian looked Yang Kai up and down, and after confirming that the aura fluctuations coming from him were indeed those of a Second-Order Saint King, the corners of his mouth curled upwards, revealing a look of disdain. However, when his eyes glanced over at Yang Yan, he could not help showing some surprise.</p>
<p>Hou Jian had not expected this woman wrapped in black robes to actually have such an extraordinary appearance. What was stranger though was that after being stopped by him, this man and woman did not show any signs of panic, both of them actually remaining perfectly calm.</p>
<p>What was most confusing for Hou Jain though was that he could not see Yang Yan’s true cultivation. When he tried to use his Divine Sense, it seemed to pass right through her body, as if she did not even exist.</p>
<p>This made Hou Jian’s expression become somewhat serious as he subconsciously regarded Yang Yan as a more powerful cultivator than Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Hou Jian had mainly come here targeting Yang Kai and naturally had no interest in Yang Yan, so after a brief investigation, he withdrew his gaze and focused his attention on Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Greetings, friend!” Yang Kai took a step forward and cupped his fists, “Is there some reason you have blocked my Senior Sister’s and my path?”</p>
<p>“Some reason? Heh...” The burly man let out a chuckle, “Are you surnamed Yang?”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>“Did you just leave Grand Crystal Mountain Range?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“Very good, this Hou is looking for you, little brat!” Hou Jian’s face went cold, and he shouted firmly, “Daring to have ideas about my Sect’s Coloured Glass Mountain, even damaging the barrier protecting it, I’d like to see how you try to escape!”</p>
<p>Hearing what Hou Jian said, Yang Kai was completely shocked, subconsciously thinking that his good deeds had been exposed, but after thinking about it for a moment, he felt that something was wrong. If he had really been exposed, there would not have just been three Saint Kings chasing after him. Coloured Glass Sect would have at least sent out a few Origin Realm Masters to ensure he was captured.</p>
<p>But if he hadn’t been exposed, why did this guy sound so sure he was guilty?</p>
<p>How could Yang Kai have known that this burly man surnamed Hou had just listened to Yin Su Die and assumed she had told him the truth?</p>
<p>Not showing any anxiety on his face, Yang Kai let out a laugh, “This friend must be joking. I came to Grand Crystal Mountain Range at the invitation of your noble Sect’s Dai Yuan and was her guest for only a few days. How could I have had any ideas about ​​Coloured Glass Mountain?”</p>
<p>“Dai Yuan?” Hou Jian immediately gawked and he asked in surprise, “Do you know Dai Yuan? And she actually invited you to be a guest?”</p>
<p>He wore a dumbstruck expression on his face as he asked this question, as if he had just heard something completely unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Of course! I have no reason to lie about this. You can go back to Thousand Illusion Peak and ask Sister Dai Yuan, she will surly confirm what I’ve said.”</p>
<p>“Ask Dai Yuan...” Hou Jian’s face flashed a fearful expression for a moment, but he quickly waved his hand in the next moment and declare unreasonably, “Don’t spout nonsense brat! No matter what you say now, you will not be able to escape. This Hou has been entrusted to capture you so that is what I will do. As for what you’ve done or whether you’re guilty, that has nothing to do with me, I’m only responsible for bringing you back to face judgement!”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yang Kai grinned widely, “So what this friend is saying is that you’ve no intention of allowing me to pass?”</p>
<p>“Hmph!” Hou Jian coldly snorted, “That’s how it is!”</p>
<p>As soon as he spoke these words, Hou Jian condensed a dazzling light on his fist as a fierce aura burst from his body. Leaping up into the sky in the next moment, Hou Jian soared like an eagle before abruptly turning around and swooping down, his right hand taking on a cold, metallic appearance as he palmed towards Yang Kai’s head.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with Yang Kai as the centre, everything within a hundred metres seemed to freeze, and as this palm approached, it was like the entire sky was collapsing downward. The atmosphere became heavy, making it difficult to breathe or even stand. Yang Yan, who was standing behind Yang Kai, even let out a gasp as her tender body slightly trembled.</p>
<p>However, a light burst from Yang Yan’s body in the next instant and freed her of this suppression. At the same time, her figure quickly retreated a thousand metres, escaping the range of Hou Jian’s attack.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Hou Jian was quite surprised, obviously not having expected Yang Yan to break free of his technique so easily. Although he did not know what that flash of light just now was, it was no doubt created by some kind of powerful artifact.</p>
<p>Although the power of this artifact was clearly quite good, Hou Jian still didn’t put it in his eyes, so after only a slight hesitation, he put more strength into his palm and continued to press it down towards Yang Kai while roaring fiercely, “Kneel down!”</p>
<p>He wanted to suppress Yang Kai with a single blow so that Yin Su Die, who was watching, could witness his strength.</p>
<p>This was a rare performance opportunity, so how could Hou Jian miss it?</p>
<p>When this palm was just ten metres away from Yang Kai though, a sneer appeared on the latter’s face as he stared straight back at this unreasonable man indifferently.</p>
<p>As soon as Hou Jian acted, Yang Kai was able to see that he wanted to use his great physical strength and vigorous Saint Qi to end this battle decisively. If it had been any other Second-Order Saint King Realm cultivator facing such an attack, they would certainly be panicking right now, but how could Yang Kai even place this fool in his eyes?</p>
<p>The pressure from Hou Jian’s technique alone would be able to crush any ordinary cultivator, but against Yang Kai it had no effect at all. Waving his hand casually, Yang Kai easily disrupted the heavy pressure, causing it to rapidly distort and then shatter like fragile glass.</p>
<p>In an instant, the mountain like pressure disappeared.</p>
<p>At the same time, Yang Kai figure, which had been shrouded in the shadow of his opponent’s palm, suddenly blurred, and vanished from sight.</p>
<p>Hou Jian’s face changed dramatically when he saw this, never having expected that a mere Second-Order Saint King would be able to escape the control of his pressure field. What’s more, after breaking free of the pressure field, his opponent had actually disappeared, with Hou Jian unable to even detect a trace of his aura.</p>
<p>Hou Jian became frightened as he immediately understood he had kicked an iron plate. While searching for some trace of Yang Kai, he suddenly felt an oppressive and dangerous aura coming from above him.</p>
<p>“Not good!” Hou Jian shouted to himself as he whipped around sharply to discover that Yang Kai had reappeared above his position and was now looking down upon him coldly, like a dragon flying over Nine Heavens overlooking an ant, causing Hou Jian to shudder unconsciously. Yang Kai immediately sent out what looked like a casual palm strike, but in Hou Jian’s eyes this palm appeared to cover the entire sky, making him feel like it was impossible to avoid.</p>
<p>Hou Jian did not dare hold back, hurriedly condensing as much of his strength as he could in that moment and lifting both his hands up high, as if he was trying to hold up the Heavens themselves. At the same time, a bright light shone from his body as he summoned out a metallic Artifact Armour.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, from the centre of his forehead, Hou Jian released a spinning cone of black light that shot out to intercept the world covering palm Yang Kai had released.</p>
<p>Hou Jian was an elite disciple of Coloured Glass Sect so even caught off guard, he was still able to make this many moves, fully demonstrating his great strength.</p>
<p>But even after all this, the unease in Hou Jian’s heart did not decrease, nor did he feel the slightest sense of security.</p>
<p>Under Hou Jian’s astonished gaze, the black cone-like weapon he had shot out struck the giant palm print and immediately grew dim, revealing its original shape.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a powerful spindle-like offensive artifact, but as soon as it was struck by Yang Kai’s Heaven Covering Hand, it was blown away and appeared to have suffered catastrophic damage.</p>
<p>Immediately after, the Heaven Covering Hand fell onto Hou Jian without further hindrance, causing his arms to buckle and his metallic Artifact Armour to crack. A single breath of time later, this Artifact Armour completely shattered.</p>
<p>Hou Jian grit his teeth hard and released a ferocious shout, pouring all the Saint Qi he could into his arms and punching out countless fist shadows to intercept the still approaching palm print.</p>
<p>Yang Kai saw this and simply snorted coldly, pushing his Saint Qi harder as he increased the power of his Heaven Covering Hand by another thirty percent.</p>
<p>The innumerable fist shadows rushed into the Heaven Covering Hand and disappeared like clay oxen wading into the sea, not even causing any waves before they were devoured without a trace.</p>
<p>Hou Jian complexion paled. Although they had only fought for a mere three breaths, he already understood that he was completely not worthy to be the opponent of this man his Junior Sister Yin was looking for!</p>
<p>While he understood this in his heart, Hou Jian only showed a look of unwillingness on his face.</p>
<p>Before Hou Jian could take any further action though, the giant palm broke through is resistance and impacted him directly.</p>
<p>With a thunderous bang, Hou Jian’s body plummeted through the air and slammed into the ground, opening a giant pit upon impact. The Heaven Covering Hand did not just disappear though and instead continued to ruthlessly press down towards Hou Jian.</p>
<p>The earth shook once more and a giant palm print spanning a nearly thousand-metre area was carved into the ground. At the very centre of this palm print, Hou Jian knelt on one knee, his hands still lifted upwards as his entire body convulsed.</p>
<p>Hou Jian’s thick arms were covered in blood, giving them a horrifying appearance, and his clothes had been almost completely shredded, revealing most of his burly body. With both his arms bent into unnatural shapes, it was clear the injuries he had received were not light.</p>
<p>Even in such a state though, Hou Jian continued to stare stubbornly at the slowly descending Yang Kai, a mixture of panic and hatred flashing across his eyes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there was a trace of surprise on Yang Kai’s face. He had not thought that this man could withstand his Heaven Covering Hand. It seemed this man’s burly body was not just for show, his physique was clearly quite intrepid.</p>
<p>Seeing Hou Jian’s hate-filled eyes, Yang Kai’s brow lifted slightly. Landing in front of his opponent, Yang Kai lifted his foot and pressed it onto the opposite party’s shoulder while flashing a dangerous grin.</p>
<p>Hou Jian’s face went pale. Although he knew what Yang Kai was going to do, he was too gravely injured right now to even move much less resist, so all he could do was wait for the inevitable.</p>

<p>Under the uneasy gaze of the Hou Jian, a powerful force suddenly impacted his shoulder. This force instantly overcame any resistance he could muster and pressed Hou Jian into the ground. His face being shoved into the dirt, Hou Jian was embarrassed, but no matter how he struggled, Yang Kai’s foot pressing on his shoulder remained as heavy as a mountain, rendering him unable to move at all. Even covered in dust, the crimson glow on his face from indignation was apparent.</p>
<p>A thousand metres or so away, Yin Su Die and Luo Min who had finally arrived witnessed this unbelievable scene and could not help doubting their eyes.</p>
<p>The two of them had followed behind Hou Jian at a leisurely pace, and although they seemed to be chatting casually, both had witnessed the entire conflict between Yang Kai and Hou Jian.</p>
<p>Of course, this short exchange of blows could barely even be called a fight.</p>
<p>Hou Jian had charged forward in an imposing manner, sent out a powerful strike, and shouted arrogantly for Yang Kai to kneel. Yin Su Die and Luo Min had clearly heard all this but instead of Yang Kai being the one on the ground now, it was their companion who was having his face pressed into the dirt.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die and Luo Min were naturally clear that among Coloured Glass Sect’s Saint Kings, Hou Jian’s strength ranked among the top ten; but such an elite disciple had actually been defeated in a single blow by Yang Kai and was being suppressed to the point where he was unable to even fight back. How could Yin Su Die and Luo Min not be shocked?</p>
<p>None of the Saint Kings in Coloured Glass Sect could achieve such a feat.</p>
<p>Didn’t that mean that this Yang Kai was far more powerful than all the elites in their Sect? Luo Min’s complexion went slightly pale as he nervously swallowed. He considered his own strength and imagined if he had been the one to go forward instead of his Senior Brother Hou, quickly estimating that his end would not have been much better.</p>
<p>Being defeated was one thing, but the key point here was that this loss had happened in front of Yin Su Die. Worse, Hou Jian had been arrogantly boasting just moments ago so the embarrassment he was suffering right now was even greater. Presumably, Hou Jian would not have any face to continue pursuing Yin Su Die in the future. Realising this, Luo Min secretly took some pleasure in Hou Jian’s misfortune.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die was also learning for the first time how powerful Yang Kai truly was. Although she had met Yang Kai a few times before, she did not have any kind of deep relationship with him, so how could she have known that a small unknown character like him would possess such strength?</p>
<p>Perhaps even Fang Tian Zhong and Qu Chang Feng would not be Yang Kai’s match. Moreover, he seemed to have a close relationship with her Senior Sister Dai Yuan.</p>
<p>Thinking so, Yin Su Die was not discouraged in the slightest and instead had a different kind of light flash across her eyes. As she stared at Yang Kai, she covertly whispered to Luo Min, “Senior Brother Luo, you see that woman in black robes over there?”</p>
<p>“En, what is Junior Sister thinking?” Luo Min Zhe Yan glanced over at Yang Yan</p>
<p>“Can you quietly capture her?” Yin Su Die smiled lightly, as if she was asking about some trivial matter.</p>
<p>Luo Min’s face changed slightly. Although he wanted to strike his chest and agree right away, seeing the scene in front of him, he hesitantly said, “Junior Sister can see the current situation, even Senior Brother Hou isn’t that surnamed Yang’s opponent, so how am I supposed to capture that woman right in front of his eyes? Also, he does not seem like an affable fellow, if attacking that woman enrages him, the gains won’t be worth the cost.”</p>
<p>“Senior Brother Luo may rest assured. Since Junior Sister has proposed this, naturally I have my own arrangements,” Yin Su Die smiled slightly, “While I keep him occupied, Senior Brother Luo just needs to take the opportunity to seize that woman.”</p>
<p>Even hearing this, Luo Min still hesitated to agree.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yin Su Die pretty face sank slightly, but light soon flashed across her beautiful eyes as she thought of something and said, “Senior Brother Luo, I know what you’re worried about but I only need you to capture that woman. So long as you don’t hurt her, that man won’t have any reason to find trouble with you later. Not to mention, Senior Brother Luo, although you are not his opponent, with your Flowing Light Escaping Shadow, even if he attacks could he catch you? Can Senior Brother Luo really not satisfy Junior Sister’s little request?”</p>
<p>Contemplating Yin Su Die’s words, Luo Min pondered for a moment before nodding, “Fine. Since Junior Sister thinks so highly of Senior Brother, just leave that woman to me. However, Junior Sister, you must be careful. That surnamed Yang does not seem to be an ordinary person, you must make sure to not suffer a loss at his hand.”</p>
<p>Luo Min seemed to be greatly confident in his Flowing Light Escaping Shadow, so even after witnessing Yang Kai instantly force Hou Jian onto the ground in defeat, he still agreed to Yin Su Die’s request.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die let out a peal of enchanting laughter and nodded, “If Junior Sister fought him head-on, I would surely lose within ten moves, but how could I give him such a chance?”</p>
<p>Luo Min turned his head and glanced at Yin Su Die upon hearing this only to discover that a faint halo of light was being emitted from his Junior Sister. This halo of light didn’t have any kind of aura to it, but the moment Luo Min saw it, his mind shook and it seemed as if his Junior Sister’s body was now exuding an overwhelming attraction, pulling directly on his soul, making him unwilling to move his eyes away from her, as if he couldn’t wait to be drawn in and submit his entire being to her.</p>
<p>Luo Min was dazed for a moment but quickly bit his tongue to extricate himself from this attraction, cold sweat dripping from his forehead in the next moment as he turned his eyes away. He didn’t dare gaze at Yin Su Die again as he realized that his Junior Sister’s Beguiling Technique had improved far more than he earlier estimated, to the point where he had no confidence in resisting it should he be targeted by her. This boosted Luo Min’s confidence in Yin Su Die greatly.</p>
<p>At that moment, Yang Kai, who was still stepping on Hou Jian’s shoulder, suddenly looked over towards Yin Su Die and Luo Min, as if he had only just now noticed them. Smiling widely, he called out, “Sister Yin, what a coincidence! To actually meet you here, it seems we share a bond of fate.”</p>
<p>“Bond of fate, hehe...” Yin Su Die covered her mouth and smiled, a bewitching light flashing across her beautiful eyes as she exuded a seemingly infinite charm and said, “We do seem to share some fate, but this time is not a coincidence. I deliberately used Coloured Glass Sect’s Space Array to travel to the nearby city in order to find you.”</p>
<p>“You came to look for me?” Yang Kai raised his brow slightly, feigning surprise, “What for? Does Sister Yin have something she needs from me?”</p>
<p>The smile on Yin Su Die’s face faded and was replaced with a sad one, “It’s nothing so important, I just wondered if Little Brother forgot about the agreement with me from the other day? Didn’t you say that you would come to visit my Myriad Crystal Peak when you have time? Now you have suddenly decided to leave without even saying goodbye... could it be that Senior Sister Dai Yuan didn’t provide you with an appropriate reception? If so, please allow Junior Sister here to make up for it. Senior Sister Dai Yuan is not fond of communicating with others and can be somewhat difficult to get along with. I hope Little Brother can be forgiving and not haggle over such small matters.”</p>
<p>Saying so, Yin Su Die really bowed in apology, cleverly displaying just enough of her astonishing assets in the process as she also cast her eyes towards Yang Kai elegantly, exuding a kind of charm that seemed to pull directly on one’s soul.</p>
<p>In response though, Yang Kai put on a flattered appearance and quickly waved his hand, “Sister Yin is far too serious. Sister Dai Yuan’s entertainment wasn’t lacking in any way, it is just that Junior Brother has some important matters to attend to, so it is inconvenient to remain in Coloured Glass Sect for a long time. That is why I departed so anxiously.”</p>
<p>While appearing completely at ease on the surface, Yang Kai was silently sighing with relief. As soon as Hou Jian appeared, he had charged Yang Kai with breaking the barrier around Coloured Glass Mountain, but now Yin Su Die was not even mentioning it. It seems the Stone Puppet had not been exposed, so Yang Kai no longer had anything to worry about.</p>
<p>“So that’s how it is!” Yin Su Die nodded her delicate chin lightly before lifting her jade white hand and gently brushing her hair behind her ear, exposing her dainty pink earlobe and saying with a smile, “Little Brother, before we speak any further if you don’t mind, could you release my foolish Senior Brother? It seems that there was a misunderstanding between him and you just now, but Little Brother has given him an appropriate punishment already, so can you let him off with just that?”</p>
<p>“He is your Senior Brother?” Yang Kai wore a startled look before putting on an apologetic look, “So he is also a disciple from Coloured Glass Sect. I was wondering who this blind fellow who suddenly appeared and started looking for trouble with me was, even attacking without asking anything. Since he is Sister Yin’s Senior Brother, naturally I will return him to you!”</p>
<p>Saying so, as if he was just casually sweeping his foot, Yang Kai kicked Hou Jian’s abdomen.</p>
<p>A cracking sound rang out and Hou Jian’s complexion, which had been bright red with embarrassment, suddenly went white as he flew through the air towards Yin Su Die.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die pretty face changed slightly, apparently not having thought Yang Kai would act so ruthlessly. Although that kick seemed to have been delivered lightly, judging from the sound just now, it was likely that more than half of her Senior Brother Hou’s ribs had been broken by it. This kind of injury, while not heavy, was certainly not light either and would take at least three of four months of bed-rest to completely recover from.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die’s eyes flashed with a trace of irritation, secretly annoyed that Yang Kai did not sell her any face at all. Waving her jade white hand lightly, she condensed a kind of pink cloud in front of herself.</p>
<p>When Hou Jian’s body hit this pink cloud, it was as if he had sunk into a ball of cotton and all the force from Yang Kai’s blow was resolved, allowing him to land without suffering any further injuries.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die raised her hand once more, placing it on Hou Jian’s shoulder and spinning him about. After everything was over, Hou Jian was calmly standing beside her, but his complexion was pale white, and he could not wait to find a hole to crawl into and disappear.</p>
<p>What made him most uncomfortable was that Yin Su Die did not even spare him a glance, completely ignoring him after helping him land, leaving him to stand there awkwardly, unable to utter a single word.</p>
<p>On the other side, when Yang Kai saw this scene, he could not help feeling a bit of surprise. A moment ago, he had poured a significant amount of Saint Qi into Hou Jian’s body, but Yin Su Die was able to resolve it without any difficulty. It seems that this woman was not as simple as she appeared; since she was able to become the leader of Coloured Glass Sect’s younger generation though, it was natural for her to have some means.</p>
<p>“If there’s nothing else Sister Yin has to say, this Yang will take his leave,” Yang Kai decided not to tangle with this woman; after all, she was the head disciple of Coloured Glass Sect, so there was no way he could kill her. If Yang Kai continued to engage with her, he was the one who would inevitably suffer a loss, so he decided to leave immediately.</p>
<h2>1283</h2>
<p>Chapter 1283, Beguiling Technique Illusion</p>
<p>Listening to Yang Kai say this, Yin Su Die giggled coquettishly before saying, “Please don’t be in such a rush Little Brother! Junior Sister came here this time especially to invite Little Brother to visit Myriad Crystal Peak. Junior Sister is quite curious about Little Brother’s relationship with Senior Sister Dai Yuan. If possible, I’d very much appreciate it if Little Brother can come back with me. Little Brother must know that Senior Sister Dai Yuan does not communicate with others in the Sect, even Junior Sister has difficulty having a good conversation with her. On the other hand, Little Brother is the first guest she brought back in the past two decades. Not only am I curious about this matter, even my Honoured Master has taken an interest in it. Junior Sister has actually come here to request Little Brother come back on my Honoured Master’s orders.”</p>
<p>“On your Honoured Master’s orders?” Yang Kai looked at Yin Su Die with a smile, seemingly pondering for a moment before replying, “It is not that I wish to refuse Senior Gong’s invitation, but this Yang truly has some important matters to attend to that cannot wait. Would it be acceptable for this Yang to pay his respects to Sister Yin’s Honoured Master when he visits Coloured Glass Sect in the future?”</p>
<p>“In the future... who knows when that future date will be. Junior Sister thinks that instead of waiting, it would be best for Junior Brother to accompany me back today,” Yin Su Die did not back down and instead became much more forceful in her words to Yang Kai, seemingly implying she would not relent no matter what.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed slightly; the other party pestering so incessantly had naturally made him a bit disgruntled. It seemed that this matter could not be settled so easily, but thinking about it carefully again, Yang Kai realized he was being naive. Since Yin Su Die had chased him all this way, it was naturally impossible for her to simply give up and retreat.</p>
<p>Letting out a light sigh, Yang Kai asked solemnly, “If I insist on not following you back?”</p>
<p>“You want to refuse?” Yin Su Die giggled as she looked at Yang Kai with interest, exhaling an orchid scent as she said, “I’m afraid that decision is not one Little Brother can make.”</p>
<p>As soon as her voice fell, Yang Yan, who was standing about a thousand metres from Yang Kai, suddenly let out a shout, as if she had encountered a sneak attack.</p>
<p>Yang Kai eyes instantly became cold as he quickly turned around to look.</p>
<p>He didn’t know when it had happened, but a male cultivator wrapped in a bright white light had at some point moved to capture Yang Yan, but he had clearly failed in his initial attempt and was instead repelled by one of Yang Yan’s defensive artifacts. At this moment, this male cultivator stood in place with a deep frown on his face, his hand still stretching out in a grasping position, seemingly competing with a fiery red light being emitted from Yang Yan’s body.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as he immediately recognized that this male cultivator was the one that had been following Yin Su Die.</p>
<p>Hurriedly turning his head back to look behind Yin Su Die, the figure that had been standing there a moment ago had mysteriously disappeared, leaving behind only a white glow that was rapidly dissipating.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was genuinely shocked!</p>
<p>He had no idea when this man had left Yin Su Die’s side and gone off to sneak attack Yang Yan. The secret technique cultivated by this man was obviously quite unusual and was even capable of deceiving Yang Kai’s sharp senses.</p>
<p>It was conceivable that if Yang Yan had not been wearing so many artifacts she had personally refined, this man’s sneak attack would have succeeded. If Yang Yan had been captured, Yang Kai would have immediately fallen into an extremely passive situation, and even if he did not want to, he would have had to follow Yin Su Die back to Coloured Glass Sect.</p>
<p>After realizing he had fallen for the other party’s scheme, Yang Kai became furious. Ignoring Yang Yan’s situation, his eyes flashed a sharp light as he glared coldly towards Yin Su Die.</p>
<p>The artifacts Yang Yan had on her were all outstanding, and although Yang Kai did not know the exact number she was wearing, he was confident that no Third-Order Saint King would be capable of even touching her.</p>
<p>Even an ordinary Origin Returning Realm cultivator may not be able to seize Yang Yan, that was how outstanding her self-protection ability was.</p>
<p>The moment Luo Min attacked Yang Yan, Yin Su Die also acted against Yang Kai. With the sweet, crisp, silver bell-like laughter, the pink cloud she had summoned once before appeared again, this time transforming into a large pink mist barrier that completely enveloped Yang Kai.</p>
<p>In the next moment, Yin Su Die exhaled a fragrant breath into this pink mist barrier. The pink mist barrier immediately tumbled as if it had come alive while the sounds of delightful music and tender laughter echoed throughout it.</p>
<p>As soon as these voices came out, the originally pale Hou Jian who was standing behind Yin Su Die immediately blushed red as his blood boiled and his eyes filled with burning fire as he stared into Yin Su Die’s Beguiling Technique obsessively.</p>
<p>Seemingly feeling his fiery gaze, Yin Su Die frowned, turned around, and smacked Hou Jian’s head, causing his glazed over eyes to once again restore their clarity.</p>
<p>“Compose yourself! Disgraceful!” Yin Su Die snorted disapprovingly, causing Hou Jian’s face to turn even redder.</p>
<p>He had embarrassed himself twice today so, in the future, he would not have the face to lift his head in front of Yin Su Die. This Beguiling Technique had not been aimed at Hou Jian, so with his strength and cultivation, it shouldn’t have been difficult to resist, but having been injured by Yang Kai, causing his Saint Qi flow to become unsteady and his mood to swing wildly, Hou Jian had actually failed to maintain a clear state of mind.</p>
<p>Hearing Yin Su Die’s harsh rebuke just now, Hou Jian felt his heart sink and his only thought now was to return to Coloured Glass Sect and enter an extended retreat.</p>
<p>“There will be a place where Senior Brother Hou’s strength is needed later, so focus on recovering for now!” Yin Su Die saw Hou Jian’s embarrassed look and quickly offered some words.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Hou Jian’s eyes flashed, and a stern look returned to his face as he restrained his embarrassment. Nodding once, he sat down cross-legged and took out a few bottles of pill from his Space Ring, pouring them into his mouth and swallowing them before taking out two High -Rank Saint Crystals, holding them in his palms, and circulating his Secret Art.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yin Su Die showed a slight look of satisfaction on her face while continuing to manipulate the pink mist barrier in front of her, enhancing the power of her Beguiling Technique.</p>
<p>Inside the pink mist barrier, Yang Kai stood still and observed his surroundings. The place he was standing had changed dramatically. Originally, it had been a vast wilderness, but now Yang Kai actually found himself standing inside a grand palace.</p>
<p>In front of him right now was a huge pool filled with crystal clear water that carried strong scent of wine that seemed to penetrate directly into Yang Kai’s nose.</p>
<p>Beside the pool, there were more than twenty young girls in revealing dresses who were dancing playfully. Each of these young girls had a soft waist, graceful figure, overall outstanding appearance, but none of them were the same, all of them having their own particular charm. Some of them boldly sent Yang Kai’s passionate gazes while others shyly avoided making eye contact.</p>
<p>Some of them had chilly auras, making them appear like cold, inviolable goddesses.</p>
<p>Others were bold and flirtatious, showing off the amazing fullness and elasticity of their twin peaks and milk white bottoms as they twirled about enticingly.</p>
<p>Still others wore shy, innocent looks that would elicit feelings of pity from even the coldest of men.</p>
<p>A soft, melodious music filled the air which in conjunction with the dancing poses of these beautiful young girls gave people the illusion that they had arrived at the most glorious flower garden, involuntarily pulling on their hearts as they were drawn in by these alluring sights and sounds. It made one wish to immerse themselves in this paradise and never leave.</p>
<p>Yang Kai, however, just stood on the spot and looked at everything around him indifferently, not showing even the slightest interest in the young dancing girls.</p>
<p>After suffering such a big loss using her Beguiling Technique to deal with Yang Kai last time, Yin Su Die apparently had not learned her lesson and was attempting to use the same strategy again. It was hard to imagine what she was thinking.</p>
<p>However, this Beguiling Technique did have some impressive features to it. If it was an ordinary Saint King Realm cultivator standing here, they would definitely have their mind thrown into chaos. But Yang Kai’s Soul and Divine Sense were astonishingly powerful and this was not the first or second time he had dealt with Beguiling Techniques, he could even be called an experienced expert in this field, so looking around at this scene filled with flaws, how could his mind be shaken?</p>
<p>Yin Su Die also seemed to realize that Yang Kai had not fallen into confusion and after a while, she changed her tactics. The pink mist barrier suddenly roiled and the expressions on the more than twenty young girls who had been singing and dancing gleefully just now all changed and became filled with sorrow and sadness, the music filling the air also slowing and becoming more somber.</p>
<p>With this sad music in the background, these young girls seemed to transform from enchantresses to abandoned young women filled with sorrow and dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Their originally neatly arranged clothes also instantly became thinner and clung to their tender bodies more tightly, emphasizing their full curves and flat abdomens, even causing the fragrant grasslands between their long delicate legs to become partly visible. If Yang Kai was willing, obtaining them would be as easy as lifting his hand.</p>
<p>The temptation of this situation, compared to the previous happy revelry, immediately rose to a whole new level!</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned for a moment but soon grinned widely. He was planning on taking decisive action just now but after thinking about it briefly he actually withdrew his Saint Qi and folded his arms, assuming the position of an amused observer, preparing to appreciate Yin Su Die’s Beguiling Technique as if it were some kind of show.</p>
<p>After half a cup of tea’s worth of time, the pink mist barrier transformed again, and Yin Su Die increased the power of her Beguiling Technique for a second time.</p>
<p>When the fog settled, the previously grieving girls had become completely naked and were now entangled with one another like water snakes, exposing their beauty to the air in pairs or groups of three or five. Each one of them was exhaling a rich orchid sent as they brushed against their partner’s lips and bodies, wrapping them arms and legs around one another as they explored every inch of each other, leaving nothing to Yang Kai’s imagination.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes bulged slightly as he watched with great interest.</p>
<p>This was the first time he had witnessed such a scene, and although he knew it was all just an illusion, that did not diminish the impact it made. At the very least, Yang Kai had some reaction to it, his blood flow accelerating quite a lot.</p>
<p>“Not bad. Not bad at all!” Yang Kai nodded lightly, seemingly quite satisfied.</p>
<p>He did not have any intention to immediately break this Beguiling Technique and instead was actually enjoying it leisurely; after all, it wasn’t a scene one could usually appreciate.</p>
<p>A cold snort suddenly rang out as it seemed Yin Su Die became somewhat angry out of shame. In the next instant, all the entangled young girls overflowing with erotic auras had their expression warp into ones filled with hatred. It was as if all of them had transformed into poisonous vipers who were glaring at Yang Kai maliciously, their beautiful eyes all exuding an icy light.</p>

<p>Chapter 1284, Some Good Methods</p>

<p>When Yin Su Die coldly snorted, the young dancing girls all directed undisguised hatred towards Yang Kai and charged him while, at the same time, the pink mist barrier welled up and engulfed him.</p>
<p>Inside the concealing mists, these girls fluttered back and forth like butterflies, their bodies gradually blurring until they disappeared without a trace while the melodious music also became dissonant filled with murderous intent. This assault on Yang Kai’s senses was specially aimed at shaking his heart and disturbing his mind.</p>
<p>At the same time, the pink mist seemed to come alive and tried to silently penetrate Yang Kai’s body through his pores, affecting his judgment and the circulate of his Saint Qi.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die realized that her attempts to confuse Yang Kai were futile and immediately changed to a more aggressive approach.</p>
<p>She didn’t expect to be able to defeat Yang Kai like this and was only planning on delaying him long enough for her Senior Brother Luo to catch Yang Yan.</p>
<p>Inside the pink mist, Yang Kai’s expression became solemn as black flames burst from his body, covering him in a scorching hot aura. The pink mist that had been trying to invade his body was incinerated the moment it came in contact with these flames.</p>
<p>However, this pink mist seemed to be able to regenerate infinitely, so no matter how much of it was burned away by the Demon Flame, it continued to flow towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>From inside this pink mist, vague figures continuously launched sneak attacks towards Yang Kai. Naturally, these vague figures were the beautiful young girls who had disappeared a moment ago. They would appear from Yang Kai’s blind spots, making them impossible to guard against, and send out pink ribbons that wrapped around him tightly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai remained unharmed for the moment, but the pink ribbons which were binding him were quite strange, completely unaffected by his Demonic Flames.</p>
<p>This point caught Yang Kai’s attention, and upon observing these ribbons closely, he discovered that these pink ribbons were not actually illusions created from the fog but rather an Origin Grade Artifact Yin Su Die had summoned at some point. It was just that the colour and shape of this artifact matched perfectly with her Beguiling Technique, making it difficult for Yang Kai to tell immediately tell what was real and what was fake.</p>
<p>On top of that, these pink ribbons were able to restrain the circulation of Yang Kai’s Saint Qi, causing the layer of Demonic Flame protecting his body to rapidly weaken.</p>
<p>A tender laughter echoed from in all directions, making it impossible to distinguish where the source was, and immediately after, the pink ribbon tightened greatly, seemingly wanting to completely wrap up Yang Kai like a giant dumpling.</p>
<p>Yang Kai coldly snorted, grabbed one of the ribbons wrapped around his arm, and fiercely yanked on it, instantly dragging a beautiful figure out of the pink mist bank.</p>
<p>Without even waiting for this figure to get close, Yang Kai’s other hand clenched into a fist and punched out towards this tender body.</p>
<p>A pitiful scream filled the air as the tender body of a young girl exploded into a blood flower which rapidly disappeared from Yang Kai’s vision and merged into the pink mist, causing its colour to become slightly thicker.</p>
<p>Seeing the effectiveness of this method, Yang Kai instantly spun like a top, exerting all his might on each ribbon, dragging all the young girls at the other ends screaming towards him.</p>
<p>Demonic Flames burst from Yang Kai’s hands and smashed towards these illusionary figures, raising a series of ghastly screams as these young girls burst into blood mists and instantly disappeared.</p>
<p>The moment all these illusionary girls were destroyed, Yang Kai seemed to hear Yin Su Die snort.</p>
<p>It seemed that his actions just now had caused some damage to Yin Su Die, who was the source of this Beguiling Technique.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die had indeed received a bit of backlash from her Beguiling Technique being forcefully broken like this. She had not expected Yang Kai to be so ruthless and not show the slightest hint of tender affection.</p>
<p>For other men trapped in this Beguiling Technique Bewildering Array, even if they knew that these young girls were fake, they would find it difficult to ruthlessly slaughter them, allowing Yin Su Die to gain some time to exhibit the next step to her technique. This next step not only had the function of restraining an enemy, but also had an extraordinarily strong killing power. Yin Su Die had figured she could stall Yang Kai for at least as long as it took to boil a cup of tea.</p>
<p>But Yin Su Die had not anticipated that Yang Kai would completely disregard the beautiful young girls who had been created by her Beguiling Technique and cleanly slaughter them, disrupting her plans while also causing her to suffer some backlash.</p>
<p>Although the backlash was not strong and wouldn’t affect her combat capability, Yin Su Die’s beautiful eyes still filled with a ruthless colour as she called out sharply, “Senior Brother Hou!”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Hou Jian, who had been meditating behind Yin Su Die to restore himself, heard her call and immediately got up, his figure flickering as he charged into the pink mist.</p>
<p>At the same time, Yin Su Die’s Divine Sense moved, and a number of graceful figures once again appeared in the large mist bank surrounding Yang Kai. These figures however were different from the last ones as each of them was holding a different weapon, each of which were exuding a not weak energy fluctuation. There were even some figures wearing glowing Artifact Armour.</p>
<p>Yang Kai could not help but feel stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>Although he looked down on Yin Su Die for twice trying to use her Beguiling Technique to deal with him, he also knew that this woman would not be stupid enough to keep repeating the same mistake again and again. He had just smashed these figures with ease a moment ago, so why had she suddenly summoned more of them?</p>
<p>What drew Yang Kai’s attention most though were the weapons these newly emerged figures held in their hands.</p>
<p>Just as he was feeling some doubt, one of the young girls next to him waved a small fan in her hand towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>This little fan wasn’t very eye-catching, only having some birds and beasts embroidered on it.</p>
<p>But when this fan was waved, the sound of beast roars immediately rang out and a black light suddenly flew out from its surface, transforming into several large and small Monster Beasts.</p>
<p>These Monster Beasts were the same as the embroidered pictures on the small fan, and after they appeared, the fan itself became completely empty.</p>
<p>There were more than thirty of these Monster Beasts, some of them as big as buildings while others were as small as ordinary snakes, and as soon as they appeared, they all rushed directly to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“An illusion?” Yang Kai’s brow furrowed but his expression soon took on a look of shock as he condensed a Demonic Flame sword in his hand and released a series of slashes.</p>
<p>In an instant, the more than half of the thirty Monster Beasts descending upon Yang Kai were splint into halves by the sword waves, but some of them were more flexible than the others and avoided this attack and pounced onto their prey. As for the Monster Beasts that had been split apart transformed into clouds of Black Qi, gathered together, and actually reappeared, seemingly unharmed.</p>
<p>However, if one looked closely, they would notice that the colour of these reconstituted Monster Beasts was significantly dimmer than before.</p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, Yang Kai was surrounded by a dozen Monster Beasts and one of them, which was the size of a small building and modeled after a Qilin, lifted its giant front claws and pressed them down towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Before these claws even fell, a suffocating pressure enveloped Yang Kai, seemingly trying to press him into a meat patty.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t dodge though, and in order to verify his guess, he actually punched upwards to meet this attack head on.</p>
<p>A fist wrapped in Demonic Flame impacted the claw of this giant Monster Beast and knocked it flying, but at the same time, Yang Kai was forced back a few steps. The other Monster Beasts took advantage of this opening and pounced upon Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Seeing this from the outside, Yin Su Die wore a smug smile on her lips, but this smile went stiff just as fast as it blossomed.</p>
<p>Inside the pink mist, this group of Monster Beasts which had piled onto Yang Kai were themselves enveloped in a black light, releasing pitiful wails as they were blasted out in all directions.</p>
<p>“They’re not illusions! Amazing, it seems the top disciple of Coloured Glass Sect has some good methods!” Yang Kai’s appraising voice called out.</p>
<p>Only now was he able to determine that the fan and these Monster Beasts were not mere illusions. The fan was an artifact, and the Monster Beasts it released were a part of its power, both of which were tangible existences. Not only this fan though, it seemed all the weapons the girls were holding were real artifacts.</p>
<p>Inside this pink mist, only the young girls themselves were created by Yin Su Die’s Beguiling Technique, existences that straddled the line between real and illusionary.</p>
<p>“Little Brother should stop struggling pointlessly and obediently come with me!” Yin Su Die saw Yang Kai was more difficult to deal with than she anticipated and shouted coldly.</p>
<p>“If you want me to follow you, you first need to have prove you have the skill!” Yang Kai sneered, and as soon as his voice fell, his figure flickering, disappearing from its original position in a crack of thunder.</p>
<p>The instant Yang Kai’s figure reappeared though; a flash of light pierced towards him. Although this flash of light was extremely fast, Yang Kai could still clearly see its true appearance. It was a dagger-like artifact that had been thrown by one of the illusionary girls towards him with near perfect timing.</p>
<p>Yang Kai roared angrily as he stretched out a hand covered in burning hot Demonic Flame and grabbed this dagger.</p>
<p>With a cold snort, Yang Kai pushed his Saint Qi fiercely, causing his Demonic Flames to completely envelop the dagger.</p>
<p>At a speed visible to the naked eye, this dagger, which was a genuine Saint King Grade High-Rank artifact, melted like a snowflake under the sun.</p>
<p>In a flash, this dagger had been reduced to a molten metal and slipped through Yang Kai’s fingertips.</p>
<p>Now that he had determined that these artifacts were all real, Yang Kai naturally knew what to do. Yin Su Die pestering him endlessly like this had annoyed him greatly, so he was planning on teaching her what fate awaited those who crossed him.</p>
<p>When they saw this Saint King Grade artifact so easily destroyed, the expressions on the faces of the remaining young girls changed to shock. Perhaps they were connected to Yin Su Die’s mind so they would reflect her expression at the moment.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Yang Kai grinned and struck towards these girls.</p>
<p>In the next instant, cries of surprise sounded out, and the girls all spread out, urging the power of the artifacts in their hands to simultaneously attack Yang Kai.</p>
<h2>1285</h2>
<p>Chapter 1285, You Won’t Regret It?</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>It had to be said that Yin Su Die’s Beguiling Technique was unique and powerful. With this strange technique, she could easily defeat cultivators in the same realm without ever facing them directly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the one she was now trying to use this Beguiling Technique on was Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Firstly, Yang Kai’s Soul was far stronger than average cultivators in the same realm, so he would not easily be manipulated, and secondly, Yang Kai had cultivated the Yin-Yang Joyous Unification Art so he had a natural resistance to Beguiling Techniques.</p>
<p>A burst of screams rang out as the girls inside the pink mist barrier were slaughtered by Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai wasn’t actually targeting them directly as they were all simply illusions manifested by Yin Su Die, so even if he did kill them it would achieve nothing. Instead, Yang Kai was targeting the artifacts these illusionary girls were carrying.</p>
<p>There were more than twenty Saint King Grade High-Rank artifacts in total. The fact that Yin Su Die could collect this many high-rank artifacts and even use all of them at once was quite surprising because although it appeared that this illusionary girls were the ones manipulating them, Yin Su Die would have first had to refine these artifacts before that was possible.</p>
<p>Collecting and refining more than twenty artifacts must have taken Yin Su Die a great deal of time and effort, so if they were all destroyed, she would undoubtedly be distressed.</p>
<p>Sure enough, after seeing five or six of the precious Saint King Grade artifacts she had painstakingly refined being melted into slag by Yang Kai’s Demonic Flame, Yin Su Die’s anger soared as she ground her teeth and screamed, “If you destroy any more of my artifacts, I’ll make you pay!”</p>
<p>Hearing her frustrated scream, Yang Kai’s mood became more carefree as he spun around to face another of the young girls standing next to the wine pool. This illusionary girl was holding a long whip that let out a flash of lightning each time it was cracked. Among the more than twenty artifacts, it could be ranked in the top three in terms of power and value.</p>
<p>The price of such an artifact was certainly not low, and if it were to be destroyed, Yin Su Die’s mood would surely worsen.</p>
<p>Yang Kai rushed towards this girl immediately, his figure flickering a few times before suddenly appearing in front of her. This illusionary girl’s senses were connected with Yin Su Die, so she immediately noticed Yang Kai’s attack and her pretty face was filled with panic. The long whip cracked as it struck towards Yang Kai, releasing a blue flash of lightning.</p>
<p>Yang Kai coldly snorted, and made a sweeping motion with his hand, releasing a wave of Demonic Flame that neutralized all the lightning, causing it to disappear without a trace.</p>
<p>Yang Kai then reached out his other hand and grasped towards the air ruthlessly.</p>
<p>The series of whip shadows that had just been blotting out the sky instantly solidified as it was caught by Yang Kai. The Demonic Flames on his palm burst forth and the long whip’s glow quickly grew dim. At the rate it was losing its spirituality, it wouldn’t be long before this whip was destroyed like the other artifacts before it.</p>
<p>At that moment, a dream-like whisper brushed Yang Kai’s ear. This whisper seemed to contain an infinite charm and it swiftly slipped into Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s Saint Qi circulation was instantly disrupted and the intensity of the Demonic Flames covering his hand rapidly weakened.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, an extremely burly figure suddenly emerged from the wine pool. This figure was abnormally tall, with muscles as strong as forged iron, and two eyes like those of a fierce beast that were glaring hatefully towards Yang Kai. In this figure’s hand was a kind of broken blade, one that was obviously cutting into its wielder’s hand. Strangely though, there was no blood dripping from the wound opened by this broken blade, instead, it seemed the blood which should have been leaking out was being absorbed by the broken blade, dying it a crimson colour.</p>
<p>A bloody smell thick enough to make others nauseous quickly filled the air.</p>
<p>This burly man was none other than Hou Jian who was previously injured by Yang Kai.</p>
<p>At some point he had obviously snuck into the pink fog barrier and hidden himself in the wine pond. With Yin Su Die coordinating with Hou Jian, even Yang Kai wasn’t able to notice him until he attacked.</p>
<p>While Yang Kai’s attention was attracted to the long whip artifact, Hou Jian saw an opportunity and immediately launched a sneak attack.</p>
<p>The broken blade Hou Jian held, released a crimson sword wave as he swung it ruthlessly towards Yang Kai’s waist. At that moment, Hou Jian was releasing a thick murderous intent as a cold grin crept onto his face.</p>
<p>Hou Jian had suffered a big loss at Yang Kai’s hand and understood that this young man was extremely powerful, but since he dared to rush out at this time, Hou Jian was naturally completely confident in his ability to win. His source of confidence was the broken Origin Grade High-Rank artifact he was wielding. It was an evil artifact that Hou Jian had picked up during one of his trips outside for life experience and was twenty or thirty percent more powerful than an average artifact.</p>
<p>Normally, which his current cultivation, Hou Jian didn’t dare to use this artifact; after all, if it were used too many times, the evil aura inside it would likely begin to affect his personality.</p>
<p>But today he had been humiliated again and again and all that was on Hou Jian mind right now was saving face in front of Yin Su Die, so how could he care about such trivial consequences now? As such, he had immediately summoned this artifact in order to kill Yang Kai.</p>
<p>His timing was quite good. Yang Kai’s concentration had just been disturbed by Yin Su Die and also had his attention focused on trying to destroy the long whip artifact. So even if Yang Kai’s strength was outstanding, he wouldn’t be able to easily avoid this sneak attack.</p>
<p>As long as he was hit by this sword wave, he would definitely die!</p>
<p>Yang Kai was naturally able to notice the strangeness of this broken blade and for the first time showed a dignified expression. Just as he was about to dodge though, the girl who was standing in front of him manipulated the long whip in her hand to entangle Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Before Yang Kai could escape, he was bound in place while at the same time, lightning flashed from the long whip as the power of this artifact was stimulated to the fullest.</p>
<p>Bolts of lightning crackled and flooded Yang Kai’s body. Facing this situation, Yang Kai’s face grew cold and gloomy as he pushed his Saint Qi fiercely, releasing a surge of flames from his body that burned down the long whip.</p>
<p>In an instant, the long whip was destroyed and broken into countless pieces that fell to the ground, but this momentary delay was enough for the blood-red sword wave to arrive in front of Yang Kai, making it impossible for him to evade!</p>
<p>Facing this blood-red sword wave that was about to cut his body, Yang Kai calmly summoned his Purple Shield and injected his Saint Qi into it. A purple halo flashed from the shield as a series of runes lit up on its face. These runes rotated rapidly and soon leapt out from the shield, transforming into a giant illusionary shield that blocked the path of the approaching sword wave.</p>
<p><em>Hong...</em></p>
<p>With a loud bang, the blood-coloured sword wave landed on the light shield, causing it to explode, but at the same time the blood-coloured blade was repelled.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Hou Jian’s expression was dumbfounded, as if he hadn’t anticipated Yang Kai would actually possess such an excellent defensive artifact, one that was even capable of resisting his killing blow!</p>
<p>He had greatly underestimated Yang Kai’s depths.</p>
<p>When the Purple Shield was first refined, it was just an Origin Grade Low-Rank artifact, but after being enhanced once by Yang Yan, it had been upgraded to the Origin Grade Mid-Rank. Later, inside the Flowing Flame Sand Field, Yang Kai had used the Purple Shield to fight against the Artifact Spirit, resulting in its spirituality being greatly damaged. After bringing it back, Yang Kai had Yang Yan enhance it a second time, resulting in today’s Purple Shield already being an Origin Grade High-Rank artifact.</p>
<p>Its defensive capability was even more outstanding than before.</p>
<p>Being an Origin Grade High-Rank artifact as well, the Purple Shield was naturally able to block the strike of Hou Jian’s broken blade. If this hadn’t been the case, Yang Kai wouldn’t have summoned it out with such confidence.</p>
<p>After blocking the bloody blade, Yang Kai took back his Purple Shield and stared straight at Hou Jian with a stern look, a sneer soon creeping onto his face.</p>
<p>How could Yang Kai have missed the strong murderous intent the other party had released during that strike just now.</p>
<p>This man had already decided to kill him!</p>
<p>If they just wanted to bring him back to Coloured Glass Sect, Yang Kai wouldn’t have taken things too far, but now...</p>
<p>Waving his hand, a scroll-like object appeared in front of Yang Kai who wore a fierce grin. In an instant, the illusionary shadows of several mountains rushed out from this scroll. When these shadows rushed out, they immediately expanded to the point where they covered the sky before pounding down towards Hou Jian with incredible force.</p>
<p>Hou Jian’s face changed drastically and he could no longer care about anything else, hurriedly pouring all his strength into the broken blade, allowing it to wantonly consume his blood as he lifted it up high and slashed out.</p>
<p>A blood-red sword wave impacted the bottom of the approaching phantom mountain and split it in half, causing the broken pieces to fall away from Hou Jian. The earth trembled on this series of impacts as several giant pits were created.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai had used dozens of phantom peaks this time, each successive one bigger than the last, so how could Hou Jian defend against all of them?</p>
<p>Hou Jian only managed to defend himself for three breaths before his strength was completely consumed and he powerlessly watched the approaching mountain peak press down on him. Hou Jian’s face became ashen as his gaze became hollow.</p>
<p>He was certain that he would die in the next moment! Instantly, he regretted following Yin Su Die out here.</p>
<p>At that moment though, the pink mist in the surrounding as well as the grand palace and wine pool all suddenly twisted and disappeared. The figure of Yin Su Die appeared in front of the Hou Jian like a ghost, her usual charming expression replaced with solemn on as she lifted up a white bead that released a soft light in to the surrounding.</p>
<p>When he was hit by the light from this bead, Yang Kai suddenly felt his murderous intent decrease and his mood become tranquil. Even his desire to ruthlessly kill Hou Jian faltered.</p>
<p>However, in an instant, Yang Kai dispelled this hesitation as he stared at Yin Su Die coldly.</p>
<p>He knew that the reason why his will had suddenly weakened was related to the strange bead in her hand.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die on the other hand stared at the bead in her hand for a moment, seemingly looking for something, but she soon wore a happy smile as she called out to Yang Kai tenderly, “Do you really want to do this? You won’t regret it?”</p>
<p>When she spoke these words, she stood in front of Hou Jian, completely disregarding the illusionary mountain peaks above her, seemingly unafraid of death.</p>
<h2>1286</h2>
<p>Chapter 1286, Blossoming Lotus</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>After Yin Su Die asked this, she showed no further signs of resistance, her tender body seemingly delicately blowing in the wind.</p>
<p>But the look on Yang Kai’s face changed greatly as he stared at her, immediately waving his hand and retrieving the phantom mountain peaks that had been smashing down towards her. Even the Hundred Mountains Picture was tightly grasped in his hand.</p>
<p>He gazed incredulously in the direction of Yin Su Die, his eyes filled with tenderness as his lips trembled a few times before finally whispering, “Su Yan?”</p>
<p>At this moment, the one standing in front of Hou Jian was no longer Yin Su Die but rather the woman that Yang Kai longed for deep in his heart, the beauty who appeared in his dreams every night and had enchanted his heart and soul.</p>
<p>His expression immediately solidified as infinite longing filled his mind and tenderness that could melt even the coldest ice flashed across his eyes.</p>
<p>The opposite Su Yan also looked at him with the same kind of infinite tenderness, but imperceptibly, the corner of her mouth twitched slightly, as if he she had just heard a stranger’s name, changing her appearance ever so slightly.</p>
<p>Just when she thought that Yang Kai had been thoroughly confused by herself, his expression suddenly became ice cold and all the tenderness in his eyes disappeared, replaced with a thick disgust and anger.</p>
<p>Seeing Yang Kai’s look change, Yin Su Die realized that the situation had taken a turn for the worse, immediately reached out to grab the pale and bloody Hou Jian in an attempted to escape.</p>
<p>But before she could even move a step, Yang Kai’s low voice suddenly sounded, “Blossoming Lotus!”</p>
<p>Yin Su Die’s tender body, which was still facing Yang Kai, suddenly stiffened as she saw the vague vision of a lotus bud appear in his eyes. This vision was incredibly beautiful and exuded a soft seven coloured light, instantly attracting her completely attention, making it impossible for her to look away.</p>
<p>In the next instant, this lotus vision suddenly disappeared from Yang Kai’s eyes and strangely appeared in Yin Su Die’s Knowledge Sea.</p>
<p>[Soul Skill!] Yin Su Die’s face changed dramatically as he comprehended what had just happened, but as she tried to raise her defences, she noticed that the Spiritual Energy in her Knowledge Sea was rapidly being drained towards a certain location. It seemed that a huge vortex had appeared and was absorbing her Spiritual Energy. At the source of this attraction though was the ethereal lotus bud she had just seen.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die groaned as her vision was completely covered by the slowly blooming seven coloured lotus. For every petal that unfurled, the Spiritual Energy in her Knowledge Sea decreased, as if it were the nutrient required for it to blossom.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die was terrified and hurriedly tried to defend her Soul, but no matter how hard she tried, she was unable to slow the speed at which her Spiritual Energy was being swallowed.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the greater part of her Knowledge Sea had dried up! But the lotus blood had only slightly blossomed.</p>
<p>If blossoming only a tiny bit had consumed so much of her Spiritual Energy, would her Knowledge Sea be completely drained once it fully bloomed? At that point, even if she did not die, her Soul would surely suffer a grievous wound, something that couldn’t easily be healed.</p>
<p>At this point, Yin Su Die’s face suddenly paled. She had not expected that Yang Kai would really dare to kill her, and for a time, her beautiful eyes flashed a deep regret and pleading, becoming incredibly pitiful.</p>
<p><em>Peng...</em></p>
<p>Yin Su Die fell to the ground, her tender body covered with dust, no longer exuding any of her previous charm. At this moment, her face was pale white and she behaved as if there was a vice gripping her head, causing laboured gasps to escape her lips and large drops of sweat to drip from her body, soaking her clothes in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>She could not even beg for mercy!</p>
<p>The pain she felt from having her Soul drained out was harder to bear than any pain she had suffered before, but all Yin Su Die could do was grit her teeth and stubbornly defend the last vestiges of her Knowledge Sea.</p>
<p>Even so, she knew that once the seven coloured lotus fully bloomed, she would meet her end.</p>
<p><em>Sha sha...</em></p>
<p>The sound of footsteps leisurely approaching reached Yin Su Die’s ear. Barely managing to turn her head in the direction of the sound, she saw Yang Kai’s gloomy staring down at her coldly, no trace of emotion in his eyes at all.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die opened her mouth and tried to say something but failed to vocalize any words.</p>
<p>Yang Kai then snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>The seven coloured lotus blooming slowly in Yin Su Die’s mind suddenly stopped opening and soon disappeared into a scattering of light.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yin Su Die’s expression relaxed as she quickly examined the situation in her Knowledge Sea. A brief glance was all it took though to fill her with terror again. Her Knowledge Sea was almost completely dried up. If Yang Kai had not stopped his secret technique just now, the consequences would have been dreadful. Even so, if Yin Su Die wanted to completely recover, it would cost her a significant amount of time and resources.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, Yang Kai had only used his Blossoming Lotus for three breaths.</p>
<p>During these three breaths, the burly man who had originally been protected by Yin Su Die was unable to understand what had happened, only further realizing that this time the three of them had really kicked an iron plate.</p>
<p>Seeing Yang Kai not paying any attention to him, Hou Jian glanced over at the extremely disheveled Yin Su Die and steeled his heart, condensing his Saint Qi as he prepared to flee.</p>
<p>He did not have the ability to care about Yin Su Die.</p>
<p>But the moment his body move, a figure flashed in front of him, and an indifferent Yang Kai blocked his path.</p>
<p>Hou Jian’s mouth went dry as he stared at the figure in front of him, his eyes overflowed with horror, not daring to move.</p>
<p>Yang Kai simply pointed his finger at Hou Jian and sent out a blast of Demonic Flame that punched a hole directly through his left chest. The burly man couldn’t even muster the will to resist, stumbling backwards a few steps while covering the hole where heart once was. A look of utter disbelief flashed across his face before his eyes grew dim and he collapsed to the ground, the black Demonic Flames wrapping up his body and quickly burning his corpse to ash.</p>
<p>After finishing this, Yang Kai figure blurred and returned to Yin Su Die.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die was still gripping her head with both her hands and panting heavily. It seemed that the Blossoming Lotus Yang Kai used on her had caused her such a heavy injury she was unable to even move.</p>
<p>Beside her, a delicate white bead had fallen to the ground.</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced over at this bead, reached out, and pulled it into his hand. Although he didn’t know what this bead was, he was certain that Yin Su Die had used it just now to probe his mind, allowing her to use her Beguiling Technique to make it appear like Su Yan was standing in front of him.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a moment, Yang Kai tightened his grip and condensed a rich Demonic Flame to melt this bead down, completely destroying it.</p>
<p>Regardless of what this bead was, or how precious it might be, Yang Kai was not willing to let it remain.</p>
<p>After incinerating this bead, Yang Kai stared coldly at Yin Su Die and said indifferently, “Did you think I wouldn’t dare to kill?”</p>
<p>Fright flashed across Yin Su Die’s eyes and she did not dare to respond.</p>
<p>The scene just now of Yang Kai killing Hou Jian was seen clearly by her. She realized that what she had done just now had touched her opponent’s psychological bottom line, otherwise Yang Kai would not have acted so ruthless. Given his strength, the first time Hou Jian attacked him, Yang Kai could have killed him if he wished.</p>
<p>The woman named Su Yan must be especially important to him, otherwise how could things have become so serious so quickly?</p>
<p>Realizing all of this, Yin Su Die felt a deep sense of regret. If she had known Yang Kai’s strength was this tyrannical, how could she have run out here to embarrass herself?</p>
<p>“Do you think I won’t dare kill you?” Yang Kai asked again.</p>
<p>“You can’t kill me...” Yin Su Die said haltingly, “My Senior Brother should have succeeded by now, you need to consider the safety of your companion.”</p>
<p>“Succeeded?” Yang Kai’s mouth curled into a sneer as he waved his hand, releasing an extremely slender ray of light just like a golden silk thread that shot off towards the distance.</p>
<p>A moment later, the panic-stricken shout of a male cultivator rang out and a flash of light appeared mid-air, revealing Luo Min’s figure.</p>
<p>After Yin Su Die inexplicably collapsed and Hou Jian had been killed, it seemed Luo Min realized the situation was beyond saving and immediately used his Flowing Light Escaping Shadow secret technique to escape. But before he could get far, a strange golden thread chased after and swiftly broke his technique. No matter how he tried, Luo Min could not escape from the pursuit of this gold thread and in the blink of an eye, was captured by it.</p>
<p>This golden thread was naturally the Golden Blood Thread Yang Kai had been cultivating for the past year or so, an existence similar to an artifact.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s Golden Blood Thread was derived from Demon Blood Temple’s Demon Blood Thread secret technique. Yang Kai had been wanting to test the power of his Golden Blood Thread, so he had quickly displayed it here. Now seeing how the Golden Blood Thread had easily captured Luo Min and rendered him unable to escape, Yang Kai felt that all his effort was worth it.</p>
<p>Waving his hand once more, the Golden Blood Thread that bound Luo Min dragged him back over to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die’s expression became extremely gloomy upon seeing this.</p>
<p>Just now, she had engaged in a battle with Yang Kai even though she knew she would lose because she was confident that her Senior Brother Luo would be successful, so she hadn’t paid any attention to the situation with Yang Yan, only instinctively thinking the latter had been captured.</p>
<p>But looking at it now, Yin Su Die immediately realized her thinking had been too naive.</p>
<p>When Luo Min was captured, Yang Yan in her black robe also walked over. Looking at her appearance, besides being a bit frightened, she was completely unscathed, even her black robe did not have any wrinkles. It was a mystery how she had resisted Luo Min for so long without suffering the slightest loss.</p>
<p>“Succeeded was it? Have you woken up yet?” Yang Kai sneered.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die’s face went from blue to red, wishing she could find a find a hole to crawl into and hide. At the same time, she glared coldly at Luo Min, secretly blaming him for being useless.</p>
<p>Luo Min was also full of bitterness. He had not expected Yang Yan to have so many artifacts on her, each of which possessed great power. While he was attempting to capture her, the other party had not fought back at all and just passively defended herself. But no matter how he attacked, he was unable to break through Yang Yan’s defenses, so now, after being captured by Yang Kai, he really did not have the face to look at Yin Su Die.</p>
<p>Seeing Yin Su Die fall silent, Yang Kai coldly snorted and launched a palm strike towards Luo Min, pounding him into the ground and breaking many of his bones. This single blow had caused Luo Min very heavy injuries.</p>
<p>But even in this condition, Luo Min was feeling quite lucky, because it seemed Yang Kai did not intend to kill him.</p>
<h2>1287</h2>
<p>Chapter 1287, Who Is Su Yan?</p>
<p>Acting together with her two Senior Brothers, Yin Su Die had thought it would be easy to bring Yang Kai back to Coloured Glass Sect, but the result was actually one of them dying here while the other two had suffered grievous wounds. Seeing Yang Kai still staring down at her coldly, Yin Su Die suddenly realized that she had made a big mistake.</p>
<p>“Even if I fought against the entire world, she would willingly stand behind me, never barring my path or asking if I will regret,” Yang Kai suddenly said some inexplicable words to Yin Su Die, the corners of his mouth rising into a sneer as he snorted, “A cheap woman like you actually daring to transform into her likeness, you really court death!”</p>
<p>As soon as these words fell, a jet black ray shot into Yin Su Die’s tender body from Yang Kai’s hand.</p>
<p>Yin Su Die beautiful face lost all colour as she felt the hand of death reach out for her, two tears involuntarily falling from the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>These black Demonic Flames had just now easily burned her Senior Brother Hou’s body to ashes, and now they had actually been shot into her body; how was she supposed to survive? What surprised Yin Su Die though was that these Demonic Flames weren’t hot like she imagined, but extremely cold. As soon as they entered her body, she shivered involuntarily and the Saint Qi in her body began to freeze, a layer of frost soon appearing on her pale skin.</p>
<p>“I won’t kill you this time! But if you dare act against me again, I’ll give you a fate worse than death!” Yang Kai coldly snorted before waving his hand and retrieving the golden thread which had bound Luo Min.</p>
<p>Under the complex gaze of Yin Su Die, Yang Kai turned around and led Yang Yan away.</p>
<p>Only after the figures of Yang Kai and Yang Yan had disappeared for a long time did Yin Su Die and Luo Min dare to move. Although both of them had suffered greatly, neither had fatal injuries. Luo Min had many broken bones in his body, but overall he was still able to move; on the other hand, Yin Su Die’s injuries were more severe. The damage to her Soul and the frigid chill permeating her body made her feel very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Junior Sister Yin... are you okay?” Luo Min stood forced himself to his feet and asked with concern, reaching out his hand as he spoke, seemingly wanting to help Yin Su Die up.</p>
<p>“Do I look like I’m fine?” Yin Su Die’s pretty face twisted in anger as she swatted away Luo Min’s hand and staggered to her feet. Her hair and clothes were in a state of chaos and she was covered in dirt, her beforehand exquisite image completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Luo Min knew that she was blaming him for his incompetence, but even if he was angry about this inside, he didn’t dare to say anymore.</p>
<p>However, if he had known that surnamed Yang was so powerful, he would never have agreed to accompany Yin Su Die to intercept him. How was that any different from seeking destruction? Fortunately, that surnamed Yang did not seem intent on killing him, otherwise, he would currently be accompanying his Senior Brother Hou to the next life.</p>
<p>Luo Min hadn’t figure out why Yang Kai had only killed his Senior Brother Hou though, was it simply punishing one to warn the others?</p>
<p>“Junior Sister, shouldn’t we find a hidden place to rest first? We’re not too far from Myriad Beast Mountain so their disciples should pass by here quite often. If they were to see us in this state, it would become troublesome,” Luo Min asked Yin Su Die gently as she fixed her clothes. Although Yin Su Die was currently quite angry with him, he did not dare ignore her wellbeing. After all, if he were to really abandon her, after going back, he was the one who would suffer.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yin Su Die’s expression lightened somewhat as she nodded, “Yeah, let’s find a place to heal first. Moreover, we need to discuss how to explain what has transpired here to the Sect Elders before returning.”</p>
<p>Luo Min was startled for a moment but soon nodded, “It is as Junior Sister says.”</p>
<p>The two of them then supported each other as they dragged their injured bodies to a well-concealed spot nearby to meditate and heal.</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>Several thousand kilometres away, Yang Yan followed behind Yang Kai without saying a word, both of them using their respective Star Shuttles to fly towards a certain direction. As she stared at Yang Kai’s back, Yang Yan didn’t know why, but she felt as if it was revealing a desolate and lonely air. Since separating from Yin Su Die and her group, Yang Yan had noticed a change in Yang Kai’s mood. He now seemed to be in quite low spirits and his mind was obviously elsewhere.</p>
<p>Yang Yan didn’t step forward to disturb him though, instead just following behind him quietly.</p>
<p>She knew that Yang Kai becoming like this was somehow related to the last secret technique Yin Su Die had displayed and the woman whose name he had called out.</p>
<p>After a whole day and night, Yang Kai, who had been rushing ahead, suddenly came to a stop and landed on a nearby hill. At this moment, the lonely aura coming from his back suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>Yang Yan controlled her Star Shuttle to land beside Yang Kai and observing his profile, she found that he had indeed returned to normal. Secretly breathing a sigh of relief, she shifted her eyes slightly and asked, “Who’s Su Yan?”</p>
<p>“Why do you ask?” Yang Kai turned his head to her and asked back.</p>
<p>“Just curious,” Yang Yan smiled, immediately understanding that Yang Kai was reluctant to say more; but even if she didn’t ask this question or get any kind of response, she could still guess that this Su Yan must be the most important woman in Yang Kai’s life.</p>
<p>While Yang Yan did not ask anything more, Yang Kai actually wore a smile and began talking, “She is my real Senior Sister, different from the fake Senior Sister you are.”</p>
<p>“Then you’re...” Yang Yan’s smile faded, as if she had just learned something serious, a curious look appearing on her face.</p>
<p>“En,” Yang Kai nodded calmly, “But I don’t know where in the Star Field she is now.”</p>
<p>“She’s not on Shadowed Star?” Yang Yan was startled.</p>
<p>“No, arriving here was a complete accident for me. As for her, she entered the Star Field earlier than me, but I don’t know where she went.”</p>
<p>“Is that so... are you worried about her?” Yang Yan asked softly.</p>
<p>“I am worried, therefore I want to find her as soon as possible, but I don’t even know when I’ll be able to leave Shadowed Star,” Yang Kai sighed sadly, “For now, all I can do is cultivate as quickly as possible. When I grow strong enough, I’ll have a chance to leave Shadowed Star and enter the outside world to search for her.”</p>
<p>Yang Yan’s eyes turned, as if she wanted to say something, but after thinking carefully, she swallowed the words back down and waved her hand, “Let’s not discuss this anymore, you seem quite sad when you do. En, I was meaning to ask actually, why didn’t you kill those two just now? Could it be you couldn’t bring yourself to kill her because she was a woman?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai slowly shook his head, “If I could, I would naturally have killed them, but Yin Su Die’s status in Coloured Glass Sect makes things difficult. If I was to really kill her, Coloured Glass Sect would definitely not let me off. More importantly, before pursuing us, those three definitely informed others about their intentions; without such worries, I wouldn’t have minded silencing them all.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, you shouldn’t have killed any of them then,” Yang Yan frowned secretly. She had witnessed all of Yang Kai’s battles with Hou Jian and Yin Su Die and felt that there were only two appropriate choices, either kill none of them or kill all of them. Killing just one person obviously didn’t have any benefit.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled, “I killed him because he wanted to kill me, nothing more!”</p>
<p>As for Coloured Glass Sect’s reaction, Yang Kai didn’t care too much, at worse he would become enemies with them; after all, one of their disciples died at his hand. However, Hou Jian’s status was obviously not as high as Yin Su Die’s, so even if this incident created some trouble for Yang Kai, it would not be on the level of all Coloured Glass Sect’s Elders would be after his head. If Coloured Glass Sect really wanted to seek revenge, they would only send a small number of people after him. With the current defensive strength of Dragon Cave Mountain, Yang Kai didn’t fear a small raid.</p>
<p>In any case, he already had a grudge with the Xie Family, so adding one or two more enemies wouldn’t change his situation much.</p>
<p>Besides, which great Sect didn’t have a number of disciples encounter accidents or even die each year? If these Sects always sought trouble with others because their disciples died, they would not be able to develop themselves.</p>
<p>As such, Yang Kai didn’t worry about killing Hou Jian much.</p>
<p>During this battle, Yang Kai not only got to test out his Golden Blood Threads, but also the power of the Soul Skill derived from his Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus.</p>
<p>The Blossoming Lotus was a Soul Skill Yang Kai comprehended after the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus evolved.</p>
<p>The first time he used it, Yang Kai was able to instantly incapacitate Yin Su Die.</p>
<p>However, although the power of this Blossoming Lotus technique was extremely powerful, the load it placed on him was also great and the amount of Spiritual Energy it consumed was also significant. Yang Kai thought about the pros and cons for a moment and decided that this Soul Skill should be reserved for critical situations.</p>
<p>Currently, Yang Kai had his Space Blade, Blossoming Lotus, Golden Blood Thread, Demon Eye of Annihilation, and hot and cold Demonic Flame along with the Hundred Mountains Picture, Purple Shield, Origin King Grade Artifact Refining Furnace and Artifact Spirit, so even if he was just a Second-Order Saint King, he was confident he could compete with an ordinary Origin Returning Realm master.</p>
<p>As for whether he would be able to win such a battle, that would mainly depend on his opponent’s cultivation.</p>
<p>There was also Leng Qing of Star Emperor Mountain and Lu Ye of Flowing Cloud Valley that Yang Kai wasn’t certain he could kill in a head-on confrontation, especially the former who gave him quite a strong feeling of danger.</p>
<p>Naturally, this kind of matter was just a feeling as the two hadn’t actually fought yet.</p>
<p>After sifting through some of these thoughts, Yang Kai suddenly asked, “Where are we now?”</p>
<p>“You’re only asking that now?” Yang Yan snorted, “Why didn’t you think about that yesterday when you were rushing around all depressed?”</p>
<p>A trace of embarrassment appeared on Yang Kai’s face. After being affected by Yin Su Die’s mysterious technique yesterday, although there was nothing physically or mentally wrong with him, it had still sunk him into a kind of dazed, nostalgic state, and it was only after a day of adjustment that his mood had recovered.</p>
<p>Yang Yan saw this and simply laughed lightly, “Fortunately we didn’t deviate too much from our original route; we probably added three or four hours to our journey at most.”</p>
<p>“That’s good,” Yang Kai gently nodded. For this trip, he and Yang Yan had not only wanted to visit the Coloured Glass Sect, but also take care of another matter. If this wasn’t the case, it wouldn’t have been necessary for Yang Yan to come along in the first place.</p>
<p>“But before that, should you release Xiao Xiao and see how much Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass he swallowed?” Yang Yan suddenly proposed excitedly.</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai summoned the Stone Puppet back the night before, for the sake of safety, neither of them dared to check the results of their heist. Now that they finally had the time and opportunity, Yang Yan naturally couldn’t wait to see how much Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass they’d obtained.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai nodded slightly before releasing his Divine Sense and investigating their surroundings. After confirming that there was no one within a few-dozen-kilometre radius, he summoned out the Stone Puppet with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>In the sky above a huge mountain valley that seemed to span several hundred thousand kilometres, Yang Kai and Yang Yan stood observing the thick, rolling clouds down below and frowned as they felt the abnormal chill in the air.</p>
<p>Even without delving into it, Yang Kai could tell that this chill would not be easy to resist, and from time to time he could hear something similar to howling or shrieking that was not just the wind. It was enough to make normal people shudder.</p>
<p>“Are you sure this is the place?” Yang Kai watched for a while before turning his head to look at Yang Yan.</p>
<p>“En, although I don’t know the specific location, if these two map fragments are pieced together, the path they create definitely leads to this place,” Yang Yan looked at the two map fragments she was holding before examining the surroundings and nodding once more.</p>
<p>“This will be bit troublesome then,” Yang Kai frowned.</p>
<p>The reason why he had brought Yang Yan out on this trip was precisely because of these two map fragments, one of which was originally owned by Yang Yan. How she obtained it, Yang Kai never asked. As for the other fragment, it had once appeared in the Treasure Trove Pavilion auction in Heavenly Fate City and was later obtained by Yang Kai after he killed an Imperial City Sect disciple called Meng Hong Liang in the Flowing Flame Sand Field.</p>
<p>When these two map fragments were pieced together, although it was still impossible to obtain any precise coordinates, one could still make out some vague clues.</p>
<p>These map fragments obviously had a long history and should hide some valuable secrets, so once one could figure out where it led, they may be able to obtain great benefits. Dragon Cave Mountain’s resources were essentially depleted, and Yang Kai refused to allow Yang Yan to continue auctioning off artifacts, so she decided to take this opportunity when Yang Kai was going to visit Coloured Glass Sect to search for the location pointed to by these map fragments in the hope that she could find a way to resolve their poverty stricken situation.</p>
<p>After checking the amount of Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass swallowed by the Stone Puppet, the pair had rushed to this place. It had taken a full ten days before they finally arrived at this massive mountain valley. Yang Kai called it a mountain valley because he could see some mountains at its edge, but such a massive valley was something Yang Kai had never witnessed before.</p>
<p>At first glance, it almost looked as if some powerful expert had split the ground apart to create this valley. The coldness of the air inside was also quite uncomfortable. This was already the case at the periphery, so it was easy to imagine that inside the environment and danger would only be worse.</p>
<p>“Do you know where this place is?” Yang Kai asked. If he was alone, he wouldn’t be worried about anything, but Yang Yan was currently accompanying him, and although she had superior self-protection ability, if they really encountered great danger, Yang Kai wasn’t confident he could keep her safe, causing him to hesitate somewhat now.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Shadowed Star is too big so how am I supposed to recognize every single area? However, it does not look like there is any kind of settlement in the surrounding region,” Yang Yan shook her head.</p>
<p>Yang Kai felt quite exasperated hearing this comment. It was easy to see this place was not suited to live in, why would Yang Yan need to point it out?</p>
<p>Wanting to find someone to ask about the situation here was likely impossible as the last time the two of them had seen people was six days ago when they passed through a small city.</p>
<p>“Since we are already here, let’s just go in and see. The final position marked on the map fragments is still uncertain, but I don’t want to let them go to waste completely,” Yang Yan saw Yang Kai’s hesitant appearance and couldn’t help urging him.</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced at her and pondered again for a moment before nodding, “Okay! But you must follow closely, don’t get further than ten metres from me.”</p>
<p>“I know!” Yang Yan spat out her tongue before pulling her black robes tightly.</p>
<p>The two no longer hesitated and dove straight into the mountain valley.</p>
<p>The moment they entered, a thick cold air came at them from all directions, causing Yang Yan to shiver subconsciously. However, in the next instant, hot Fire Attribute Saint Qi burst from her body, dispersing the chill and allowing her to return to normal.</p>
<p>Yang Kai naturally would not care about the cold as his physique was powerful enough to passively resist it.</p>
<p>Looking around, it was obvious that this place was incredibly barren and desolate. It was difficult to see any trees and there were only occasionally some patches of grass growing here and there. The entire mountain valley was filled with a cold, dark aura, and the eerie sounds of howling constantly flooded one’s ears. Gusty winds blew back and forth, brushing against Yang Kai and Yang Yan’s bodies, sending a chill straight into their Souls, making it somewhat difficult to resist.</p>
<p>“Let’s go!” Yang Kai shouted lightly as he led Yang Yan forward, passing along the road. However, besides the uncomfortable environment and the occasional strong winds, there did not seem to be any real danger here, offering Yang Kai a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>One day later, the pair had already advanced three thousand kilometres and were currently standing in front of some scattered ruins, feeling a bit confused.</p>
<p>Obviously there had been a building here at some point, but it had long ago collapsed. The years had also not been kind and much of this ruin had been completely flattened and worn down, some of the stone surfaces even having been polished to a mirror finish by the high winds.</p>
<p>“Oh!” Yang Yan suddenly noticed something and hurriedly ran over to a nearby broken wall, slowly walking around and examining it after she arrived.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not stop her because under the investigation of his Divine Sense, he couldn’t find any signs of danger nearby.</p>
<p>After a while, Yang Yan walked back with a thoughtful look upon her face.</p>
<p>“What did you find?”</p>
<p>“A barrier,” Yang Yan quickly said, “This seems to have been the site of a long-lost Sect. There are traces of Spirit Arrays and barriers here, but they’ve all been destroyed. It seems that we’ll have to be more careful as we advance. Generally, the protective Spirit Arrays of a Sect become stronger as one proceeds further. We probably didn’t encounter anything up until now because we were still outside the borders of this ancient Sect.”</p>
<p>Listening to her saying this, Yang Kai nodded immediately and asked, “Where do we go now?”</p>
<p>Yang Yan took out the two map fragments and examined them for a moment before point in a certain direction, “That way!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai continued leading the way immediately and just as Yang Yan had suspected, along the road, the pair really encountered some remnant barriers and Spirit Arrays. However, these Spirit Arrays were not even worth mentioning in Yang Yan’s eyes. With her reminder, Yang Kai was able to easily avoid most of these barriers while the ones that could not be avoided were broken by Yang Yan.</p>
<p>None of these barriers or Spirit Arrays could last longer than three breaths in front of Yang Yan’s skill.</p>
<p>But Yang Kai didn’t show a single look of joy, his expression only growing more solemn the longer that passed. This was obviously the site of an ancient Sect, but even so many years after it had been destroyed, these barriers and Spirit Arrays were still functioning. It wasn’t difficult to imagine how powerful this Sect had been at its height, and such a Sect would not have arranged poor quality protective Spirit Arrays to defend itself.</p>
<p>Whenever Yang Yan was breaking a barrier and Spirit Array, Yang Kai would protect her from the side; then, after she broke a barrier, Yang Kai would lead the way again. The two of them worked together and cooperated exceptionally well.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yang Yan finished dismantling a small Illusion Array and clapped her hands happily. Just as she was about to say something to Yang Kai though, his face went cold, and he rushed over to her side. Grabbing her by the shoulder, Yang Kai placed Yang Yan behind himself as he pushed his free hand forward.</p>
<p>A scorching black flame was released from his palm.</p>
<p>This palm seemed to hit thin air but strangely, a howling scream suddenly rang out, one that contained a mysterious power, similar to a Soul Skill, that rushed towards Yang Kai and Yang Yan’s Knowledge Seas. However, this attack was quite weak and couldn’t even breach the pair’s Knowledge Sea defenses so they easily repelled it.</p>
<p>Even so, Yang Yan’s complexion went pale. She had not noticed any danger until the attack hit her, so naturally she was quite terrified.</p>
<p>When she peeked around Yang Kai to see what had happened, Yang Yan saw that some kind of illusory figure had actually been caught in his grasp. At this moment, Yang Kai’s Demonic Flames were illuminating the blurred features this figure which showed a very painful look, squirming as if it was being burnt alive.</p>
<p>“Yin Soul!” Yang Kai and Yang Yan blurted out almost at the same time, both of them exchanging a glance with each other as they felt the temperature around them drop slightly.</p>
<p>Yin Souls were incredibly special existences that were formed when the Soul of a creature of cultivator did not dissipate after its warm body died.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, such Souls wouldn’t be able to exist for long periods of time as without a body to contain them, they would soon dissipate and become part of the ambient World Energy. Only if a Soul were preserved inside a suitable artifact could it find a suitable physical body in short order could it survive.</p>
<p>However, could it be so easy to refine such a Soul artifact? Seizing another’s body was also extremely dangerous, if one was careless, they might instead be swallowed by the body’s original host. For example, when Old Demon wanted to seize Yang Kai’s body, he had wound up being controlled instead and forced to obey Yang Kai’s orders.</p>
<p>But there was another situation where a Soul would not quickly dissipate, and that was when their host body died in a special environment.</p>
<p>This giant mountain valley was one such environment. The chill and Yin Qi which permeated this place was incredibly rich, so Souls that were released here would dissipate at greatly reduced speed, and if there was enough opportunity, a disembodied Soul could actually transform into a Yin Soul.</p>
<p>Of course, after being transformed into a Yin Soul, this Soul would lose all be sentience and become a malicious ghost that could only act on instinct to survive.</p>
<p>Yin Souls formed like this were incredibly aggressive and would see any living creature as an enemy. They also straddled the line between the corporeal and incorporeal, making them exceedingly difficult to eliminate if one didn’t have a suitable Secret Art or artifact.</p>
<p>After Yang Kai’s Demonic Flame transformed into a pure Hot Attribute, it was equivalent to the burning rays of the sun, making it the perfect nemesis to this Yin Soul, allowing him to easily grasp and kill it. Had it been another cultivator here, they would not have had such an easy time.</p>
<h2>1289</h2>
<p>Chapter 1289, It’s Her</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>In fact, Yang Kai had dealt with these kinds of creatures before. Many years ago, when he dove into the Evil Cavern in the Ash Grey Cloud Evil Land, the Evil Spirits he encountered were similar existences to Yin Souls. At that time, he was able to collect a lot of Evil Spirit Essences after killing them, but unfortunately, no such thing remained after he destroyed this Yin Soul.</p>
<p>After entering the giant mountain valley, Yang Kai had wondered whether Yin Souls would exist here, but until now he and Yang Yan hadn’t encountered any, so he didn’t think much about it.</p>
<p>What caused Yang Kai to frown though was that since there was one Yin Soul here, it meant there would undoubtedly be a second, third, and so on.</p>
<p>Looking at Yang Yan’s complexion, she apparently thought of this as well, and her expression became uncertain.</p>
<p>As if to verify the pair’s conjecture, as soon as Yang Kai eliminated this first Yin Soul, from beneath the ground in all directions, wisps of frigid aura visible to the naked eye began sprouting up, seeming to have been roused by the death scream of the Yin Soul Yang Kai had killed.</p>
<p>These frigid auras varied in opacity, from almost invisible to as thick as fog, but no matter their density, all of them squirmed momentarily before transforming into a Yin Soul. Without exception, these Yin Souls lacked clear features and some were even missing limbs, all of them appearing extremely strange.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Yan immediately activated her Artifact Armour and in a flash, a fiery glow enveloped her body. On the other hand, Yang Kai just lifted his hands and released ten jets of Demonic Flame that swiftly penetrated the surrounding Yin Souls.</p>
<p>Although there was quite an intimidating number of Yin Souls, all of them were apparently weak and simply collapsed after a single blow. Every Yin Soul touched by Yang Kai’s Demonic Flame quickly evaporated, leaving no trace behind.</p>
<p>Yang Yan was quite relieved when she saw this and after composing herself, she took out a disc-shaped artifact and activated it with her Saint Qi.</p>
<p>In the next moment, a large halo of red light was formed, centred on the disc-shaped artifact. As this light halo expanded, it actually dispelled the ambient chill in the air and the Yin Souls caught in its radius were quickly destroyed, all of them screaming pitifully as they melted.</p>
<p>The red light halo spread out a thousand metres before it ran out of energy and faded; however, the dense swarm of Yin Souls within this radius had all been vanquished.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was stunned, quickly turning to stare at Yang Yan in amazement.</p>
<p>“Hehe, my newly refined artifact isn’t bad, right?” Yang Yan smiled back at Yang Kai happily.</p>
<p>“En, it’s very suitable for this kind of situation, but if you were facing a single opponent that is stronger, its strength would be insufficient,” Yang Kai’s vision was quite sharp and immediately saw the shortcoming of this artifact.</p>
<p>Hearing Yang Kai say this, Yang Yan pouted, “I have other artifacts that can be used against single opponents, it’s just that I’m disinclined to fight with others, hmph!”</p>
<p>Having the flaw in her artifact pointed out by Yang Kai seemed to make her unhappy.</p>
<p>Yang Kai scratched his cheek and said lightly, “Let’s go. Although these Yin Souls are quite weak, there may be stronger ones as we proceed further. We can’t be careless.”</p>
<p>And so, the two immediately continued forward.</p>
<p>This Sect ruin was quite strange. There were many Spirit Arrays still functioning as well as many Yin Souls that had spawned. On the following road, Yang Kai and Yang Yan encountered barriers and attacks from Yin Souls several times, but all these were solved by Yang Kai and Yang Yan easily, so they didn’t encounter any real danger.</p>
<p>The pair explored the mountain valley for several days, with Yang Yan checking the map fragments more and more frequently as time passed. It seemed that as they approached their destination it became more difficult for her to determine the correct position.</p>
<p>One day, while Yang Yan was checking the map fragment, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly changed and he released his Divine Sense in a certain direction. After a while, a look of surprise appeared on his face as he muttered, “There are other people here.”</p>
<p>“Other people, like who?” Yang Yan asked, startled.</p>
<p>“I’m not clear, but there are only four of them, two Third-Order Saint Kings and two Second-Order Saint Kings. It seems that they’ve been trapped in some kind of barrier.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to check it out? Perhaps they’ll be able to tell us where this place is,” Yang Yan suggested.</p>
<p>According to Yang Kai’s original idea, since the two of them had come here to treasure hunt, naturally, he wasn’t willing to complicate the situation. Regardless of who these people were, or what danger they had encountered, Yang Kai had no intention of interfering, but just now, under his Divine Sense’s investigation, two of the life auras from this group gave him a familiar feeling, as if he had encountered them before.</p>
<p>This unavoidably made him curious, and hearing Yang Yan’s proposal, he nodded and said, “Ok, let’s quietly take a look without exposing ourselves.”</p>
<p>“En,” Yang Yan naturally had no opinion.</p>
<p>The pair rushed quietly towards the unknown group’s location. Yang Kai Soul was incredibly powerful, so as long as he suppressed his aura by wrapping himself in his Divine Sense, he wasn’t worried about being discovered by cultivators in the same realm.</p>
<p>As for Yang Yan, she activated a necklace artifact she was wearing and was instantly shrouded in a thin energy barrier that appeared like flowing water. In the blink of an eye, her figure faded from Yang Kai’s vision and nearly disappeared, leaving only a faint outline behind. Even when he used his Divine Sense, Yang Kai was unable to detect her aura, so unless someone stood extremely close to Yang Yan and saw her with their own eyes, it would basically be impossible to discover her.</p>
<p>Realizing this, Yang Kai nodded lightly.</p>
<p>The unknown group of four were at least thirty kilometres away from Yang Kai and Yang Yan’s position and were only detected by Yang Kai because he dared to release his Divine Sense indiscriminately in this kind of place.</p>
<p>After an incense stick worth of time, Yang Kai and Yang Yan arrived atop a small hill and looked curiously towards this group of four.</p>
<p>The pair saw an empty field with a dome-shaped light curtain covering a range of about three hundred metres down below. From afar it almost looked like a giant overturned transparent bowl was lying on the ground with four cultivators trapped inside. Each of these four was facing a different direction and was on high alert. Light flashed around these four as each of them used their Saint Qi to operate artifacts they were holding. Two of them were focused on attacking the light curtain.</p>
<p>Although each attack these two launched could shake the light curtain, a moment later, this barrier would actually rebound their attacks towards the four trapped cultivators.</p>
<p>The remaining two from this group needed to use their defensive artifacts to resist the rebounded energy after their companions attacked so that they didn’t wind up injuring themselves.</p>
<p>This team of four was quite skilful actually and it was obvious at a glance that they were familiar with one another, but no matter how hard they tried, it seemed they were unable to break this hemispherical light curtain in short order. It was impossible to tell how long they had been trapped here, but from the unsteady fluctuations of their Saint Qi, it was apparent they had consumed a great deal of their strength.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s actually a barrier with reflective properties, interesting,” Yang Yan’s eyes lit up as she seemed to take an interest in the dome-shaped barrier.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yang Kai was frowning slightly as he stared at an enchanting young woman among the group of, muttering with a strange expression, “It’s her!”</p>
<p>Previously, Yang Kai had felt that two of the life auras here were familiar, which was why he agreed to come take a closer look, but he never expected it to actually be this woman.</p>
<p>The young woman he was seeing now was none other than Chen Shi Tao of the Clear Sky Sect. Yang Kai couldn’t say he had a deep relationship with this woman; in fact, they could barely be considered acquaintances, having interacted only briefly in the Flowing Flame Sand Field. However, this woman seemed to have identified him as a person of great destiny. At that time, she had extended an invitation to him to act together, but before Yang Kai could refuse, they had encountered Chang Qi who had been chasing down the Dragon Soul. As a result, she had gotten lucky and followed Yang Kai to an underground Saint Crystal lode.</p>
<p>Later, Yang Kai departed from the underground Saint Crystal lode in advance, leaving only the small group from Clear Sky Sect and Chang Qi to mine Saint Crystals there.</p>
<p>However, judging from the gains Chang Qi made, the group lead by Chen Shi Tao must have also reaped significant benefits. With several people working together, they had to have harvested at least a hundred million Saint Crystals while not taking any risks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Yang Kai had obtained his Dragon Bone, Dragon Bead, and Nine Branch Jade Crystal Tree from that Saint Crystal Lode, so it wasn’t impossible that Chen Shi Tao and her group obtained other treasures there as well.</p>
<p>From a certain perspective, she really had benefited from Yang Kai’s luck at that time, allowing her to have such great gains.</p>
<p>Yang Kai never expected to encounter Chen Shi Tao in this kind of place though. Of the two familiar auras he felt just now, one belonged to her while the other belonged to another beautiful woman who had been part of Chen Shi Tao’s group at that time. This young woman was a Second-Order Saint King and was currently one of the two responsible for defence.</p>
<p>“You know them?” Yang Yan tilted her head and asked softly.</p>
<p>“Barely,” Yang Kai nodded.</p>
<p>“Do you want to help them?”</p>
<p>“No,” Yang Kai shook his head decisively, “This woman is somewhat troublesome, so I don’t want to get involved with them. The situation they’re in also doesn’t seem to be that dangerous; judging from the state of that barrier, they should be able to break free in a day or two.”</p>
<p>“But I want to study...” Before Yang Yan could finish her words, her eyes suddenly narrowed as she turned away from Yang Kai and stared in a certain direction.</p>
<p>Yang Kai turned his head back at this moment and a helpless expression filled his face.</p>
<p>Because in the direction he was looking, there were several Yin Souls flying over, seemingly attracted by the disturbance here. Worse, if they continued on their current course, these Yin Souls would pass right by the hill where Yang Kai and Yang Yan were hiding.</p>
<p>Yang Kai immediately became annoyed and quietly pulled Yang Yan’s hand to retreat.</p>
<p>But the moment Yang Kai tried to withdraw, the group of Yin Souls seemed to sense his movements and all turned to look in his direction before wailing loudly and rushing over menacingly.</p>
<p>Although the concealment techniques Yang Kai and Yang Yan were using made them all but impossible to discover by Saint King Realm cultivators, as far as these Yin Souls were concerned, as long as it was a living creature, no concealment technique mattered.</p>
<p>Seeing this, murderous intent flashed across Yang Kai’s eyes as he reached out and seized the nearest Yin Soul before releasing a wave of Demonic Flames to incinerate the others.</p>

<p>Chapter 1290, Breaking Through</p>

<p>These few Yin Souls were not powerful, and their attack was easily repelled by Yang Kai, but as a result of having to defend himself, Yang Kai’s figure was exposed and noticed by the group of four nearby.</p>
<p>This group of four was startled and quickly directed a vigilant look towards Yang Kai, only to see him standing there with a helpless and awkward expression.</p>
<p>Of those four, the two males naturally had grim looks upon their faces because they were currently trapped inside a barrier and there was a separate pair of cultivators sneakily watching them from the outside. Such a situation would naturally cause suspicion as suspecting Yang Kai had some kind of nefarious purpose here wasn’t unreasonable. As such, both of them stopped their movements and directed wary glares towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the two women, after seeing Yang Kai, just gawked, but soon, Chen Shi Tao and the other beautiful young woman recalled who this familiar looking young man was.</p>
<p>Although it had been almost two years since they separated, how could Chen Shi Tao forget this man who had brought her such great benefits? Immediately revealing a look of joy, she waved her jade white hand and shouted, “So it’s you.”</p>
<p>The other beautiful young woman smiled lightly at Yang Kai, a look of delight filling her face.</p>
<p>Yang Kai felt a headache as he decided to feign ignorance, showing a surprised look and asking, “You are...”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao covered her mouth and smiled coquettishly, fluttering her lashes as she asked, “Could it be Little Brother Yang doesn’t recognize me? This Young Lady is Chen Shi Tao of Clear Sky Sect, we met each other in the Flowing Flame Sand Field.”</p>
<p>“Flowing Flame Sand Field?” When the two men beside Chen Shi Tao heard this, they could not help frowning slightly as they re-examined Yang Kai.</p>
<p>After all, anyone who could survive the Flowing Flame Sand Field could not be taken lightly. The two of them had missed the opportunity to enter the Flowing Flame Sand Field for various reasons and after learning about the massive harvest Chen Shi Tao and her team had reaped, they had felt a deep sense of regret. Their understanding of the Flowing Flame Sand Field also came from stories Chen Shi Tao had told them, so both felt that any cultivator that could return safely from it was worthy of their attention.</p>
<p>However, after realizing that Yang Kai was just a Second-Order Saint King, one of the two men spat disdainfully and promptly began ignoring him. He figured that the reason Yang Kai was able to return alive was because he had only wandered about the first layer.</p>
<p>The other male’s cultivation was lower, but he appeared quite full of spirit and was even staring at Yang Kai with interest.</p>
<p>He was the same as Yang Kai, a Second-Order Saint King, so naturally felt a bit of competitiveness.</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Shi Tao showing such a familiar look, Yang Kai felt the situation become more troublesome. When he last encountered this woman, Yang Kai deeply realized that she was a source of stress, but he had underestimated her sense of familiarity. Seeing her greet him so enthusiastically, Yang Kai really had no choice but to smile and nod, “So it’s you, I remember now.”</p>
<p>“So you’ve finally remembered me, for a moment I thought Little Brother Yang hadn’t put me in his eyes and really forgotten about me, hehe...” Chen Shi Tao seemed very happy and smiled charmingly despite still being trapped inside a barrier, her playful laughter stunning the other three in her group greatly.</p>
<p>Hearing her say this, Yang Kai could only laugh along with her.</p>
<p>After giggling for a while, Chen Shi Tao suddenly looked at Yang Kai elegantly and asked, “Right, Little Brother Yang, why have you come here?”</p>
<p>“We stumbled upon this place by accident and felt it was a little strange so we decided to come in and explore. We sensed some movement from this place a moment ago and came to investigate; however, we didn’t know what was happening, so we concealed ourselves. Please don’t blame us for acting cautiously!” Yang Kai cupped his fists.</p>
<p>“Stumbled upon this place...” Chen Shi Tao smiled as she looked at Yang Kai deeply. Although she naturally did not believe Yang Kai’s words, she didn’t ask anything more, her eye rotating slightly as she changed the subject, “Since you’ve come here, could I ask Little Brother Yang for a favour?”</p>
<p>“What kind of favour?” Yang Kai felt his brow twitch as he knew he could not avoid the coming trouble.</p>
<p>“Could you attack this barrier with your companion from the outside? This barrier has the ability to reflect attacks so it is quite troublesome for us to break from the inside, but if you attack from the outside, there shouldn’t be a problem.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai hesitated for a moment as he turned silently to Yang Yan; the latter gently nodded to him.</p>
<p>Yang Kai then nodded, “Of course.”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao pretty face filled with happiness as she said, “Many thanks, Little Brother Yang. After we get out of trouble, I will be sure to express my gratitude.”</p>
<p>“It’s just a minor matter, Sister Chen need not be so polite!” Yang Kai waved his hand before asking the group of four to stand back a bit and taking out his Hundred Mountains Picture, summoning several phantom peaks and smashing them towards the barrier.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not use his own Saint Qi because he didn’t want to expose too much in front of outsiders. The Hundred Mountains Picture was just an artifact, so others would not be able to judge much from him using it.</p>
<p>The phantom peaks smashed down violently, and just as Chen Shi Tao had expected, the rebound effect of the barrier did not activate. It seems that only those trapped inside would have their attacks reflected back at them while those attacking from the outside wouldn’t encounter such a situation.</p>
<p>Under the attack of Yang Kai, the dome-shaped barrier soon became creaky and its glow dimmed. Judging from the rate at which it was weakening, it would likely break in about a cup of tea’s worth of time.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Chen Shi Tao and the other beautiful young woman could not help feeling cheerful. The four of them had been trapped here for two days already, and although they could forcibly break this barrier in another day or two, it was naturally much easier if they had help from someone on the outside, allowing them to escape from this damned place.</p>
<p>It was at this time that the male Third-Order Saint King suddenly whispered, “Sister Chen, are you familiar with this person?”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao heard this and after considering how to respond for a moment, honestly nodded and said, “I am not too familiar with him, I just met him twice in the Flowing Flame Sand Field; however, he’s quite an interesting person.”</p>
<p>“Interesting?” The male cultivator was shocked, wondering what the meaning of Chen Shi Tao’s evaluation was. Just when he was about to inquire more carefully though, the other young man spiritedly asked, “Sister Tao, just now you said he was also in the Flowing Flame Sand Field, right?”</p>
<p>“En, I met him in the Flowing Flame Sand Field. Oh... he is actually a Second-Order Saint King now. The last time I saw him, he was just a First-Order Saint King. It looks like he had some good opportunities inside,” Chen Shi Tao’s eyes brightened as if she had discovered something surprising.</p>
<p>“A First-Order Saint King actually dared to enter Flowing Flame Sand Field, he really must not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth!” The male cultivator who had spoken first snorted coldly and scornfully said, “Him being able to live must all be due to luck, I bet he only wandered around the periphery of the first layer.”</p>
<p>For some unknown reason, this person seemed to look down on Yang Kai greatly, and although this was only their first meeting, he was intentionally disparaging him in front of Chen Shi Tao.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao however just smiled and shook her head, “He didn’t just wander around the periphery of the first layer, he at least reached the second layer as that’s where I met him.”</p>
<p>“He broke through the first layer?” The male cultivator looked surprised. After all, he heard many people say that crossing the Flowing Flame Sand Field’s first layer Flame Area was not too difficult, but there were still many dangers. Those with weaker or impure Saint Qi, such as poorly prepared Second-Order Saint Kings, wouldn’t be able to overcome these dangers and reach the second layer, so how could this brat, who was just a First-Order Saint King at the time, have the ability to break through?</p>
<p>He did not believe it.</p>
<p>“Naturally. Junior Sister Lu Ying was also present at the time, so if you do not believe me, you can ask her,” Chen Shi Tao pointed to the other beautiful young woman standing beside her.</p>
<p>The beauty called Lu Ying’ nodded repeatedly, confirming that Chen Shi Tao wasn’t lying.</p>
<p>“But... Senior Brother Wang is right about one thing, his luck is really quite good,” Chen Shi Tao smiled deeply.</p>
<p>“His luck?” The cultivator surnamed Wang heard this and slowly shook his head, “Luck is not strength, Junior Sister Chen. Haven’t you heard that counting on luck only leads to disaster? If everything in life was decided by luck, there would be no need to cultivate at all.”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao immediately showed a disapproving look, and seeing this, the cultivator surnamed Wang turned to the other male and asked, “Junior Brother Chen, do you think your Senior Brother’s words are unreasonable?”</p>
<p>“No, Senior Brother’s words makes sense,” The man with the same surname as Chen Shi Tao, and who even looked a bit similar to her, didn’t hesitate to agree with his Senior Brother’s words; however, he still looked at Yang Kai with a smile and asked Chen Shi Tao, “Sister Tao, could he be the guy you mentioned last time?”</p>
<p>“En!” Chen Shi Tao gently nodded.</p>
<p>“So it’s him! In that case, we should really become friends with him.”</p>
<p>He had clearly obtained information about Yang Kai from Chen Shi Tao and just like her, he had become interested in Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Seeing the appearance of these two people, the cultivator surnamed Wang snorted softly but no longer said anything.</p>
<p>Outside, Yang Kai’s brow twitched slightly but his expression remained indifferent.</p>
<p>Although the voices of the people inside were extremely low, with the strength of his Divine Sense, how could he not have heard them? Listening to the content of the conversation this group of four caused him to secretly complain to himself and made him feel like being curious was not always a good thing. He had come here just to quietly investigate but had wound up doing free labour while also drawing the ire of a complete stranger.</p>
<p>However, since these four people had appeared here, Yang Kai estimated that they had some important reason, otherwise they would not have come to such a strange place. Perhaps after escaping from this barrier, they would not want to become entangled with him and would look forward to him leaving as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Hoping so, Yang Kai immediately relaxed a lot and increased the power he put into his Hundred Mountains Picture.</p>
<p>After the time it would take to boil a cup of tea, the giant phantom peaks finally overwhelmed the barrier trapping Chen Shi Tao’s group and with a crisp sound, it began to shatter.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai took back the phantom peaks, stowed away the Hundred Mountains Picture, and stood waiting in place.</p>
<p>A moment later, Chen Shi Tao’s group emerged from the broken barrier with smiles on their faces and walked over to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>A delicate fragrance reached Yang Kai’s nostrils as Chen Shi Tao arrived in front of him, smiled happily, and said, “Many thanks for your assistance, Little Brother Yang, this Young Lady is extremely grateful.”</p>
<p>“Sister Chen is too polite, such a trivial matter isn’t worth mentioning,” Yang Kai quickly waved his hands and was just about to take his leave when out of the corner of his eye he spotted Yang Yan silently rushing out to examine the broken barrier, as if she was seeking something.</p>

<p>Chapter 1291, Grand Burial Valley</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai smiled bitterly; knowing that Yang Yan wanted to study this Spirit Array, his plan to quickly leave had been foiled and he could only resign himself to talking with Chen Shi Tao with a smile while waiting for Yang Yan to finish.</p>
<p>During the conversation, Chen Shi Tao naturally introduced her companions to Yang Kai with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The other young woman was someone Yang Kai had bet before as she had been part of Chen Shi Tao’s group in the Flowing Flame Sand field, Clear Sky Sect’s Lu Ying.</p>
<p>As for the other two, the male with bright eyes but lower cultivation was called Chen Fan Lei and was Chen Shi Tao’s younger brother. After listening to her introduction, Yang Kai suddenly understood why there were some subtle similarities between the two, it turned out they were blood siblings.</p>
<p>The last Third-Order Saint King cultivator was called Wang Yu Han.</p>
<p>To Yang Kai’s surprise, this Wang Yu Han and Chen Fan Lei were not disciples of Clear Sky Sect. The two of them belonged to Extreme Path Sect, which was a different force from Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying.</p>
<p>However, cultivators who had friendships or familial ties would commonly travel together even if they did not belong to the same force, so Yang Kai wasn’t too shocked after learning this information.</p>
<p>However, the name ‘Extreme Path Sect’ sounded familiar to Yang Kai, as if he had heard about it somewhere before.</p>
<p>After some brief introductions, Chen Shi Tao smiled and asked, “Little Brother Yang, why are you here in Grand Burial Valley?”</p>
<p>Her voice was sweet and soothing, and combined with a mature temperament and outstanding looks, her natural appeal almost made her more attractive than Yin Su Die when she was using her Beguiling Technique. Yang Kai quickly noticed that the man named Wang Yu Han had some intentions towards Chen Shi Tao.</p>
<p>But when Yang Kai heard the words ‘Grand Burial Valley’, his face changed slightly as he asked hesitantly, “This is Grand Burial Valley?”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao was surprised by this reaction and immediately covered her mouth to stifle her laughter, smiling as she asked in amazement, “Little Brother Yang, you couldn’t have really inadvertently stumbled into this place without knowing what it was, could you?”</p>
<p>When Yang Kai had explained his presence before, Chen Shi Tao had naturally not believed his excuse; after all, this place was several days away from the outermost edge of Grand Burial Valley, so even if someone had wandered inside accidentally, they shouldn’t have arrived at such a deep place. However, Yang Kai’s reaction and expression didn’t seem fake, making her wonder if he had actually been telling her the truth earlier.</p>
<p>“Haha,” Yang Kai’s lips twitched, “I really didn’t know what this place was.”</p>
<p>After thinking for a while, he asked, “This is the Grand Burial Valley that was left behind after the Ancient Yang Sect was destroyed?”</p>
<p>“Yup,” Chen Shi Tao nodded lightly, pursing her lips as she smiled, “It seems that you’re not ignorant about this much at least.”</p>
<p>“En, I’ve heard some rumours about this place before.”</p>
<p>The reason why Yang Kai knew about Grand Burial Valley was that Dai Yuan had told him about it in the Flowing Flame Sand Field. At that time, while waiting for the Red Candle Fruit to mature, he had asked Dai Yuan about the disciple of the Star Emperor Sect, which had eventually led to this topic.</p>
<p>According to Dai Yuan, Grand Burial Valley was originally the site of a great Sect with power equal to Thunder Typhoon Sect and Heaven Battling Union called the Ancient Yang Sect, but over two thousand years ago, this Ancient Yang Sect had killed a disciple from Star Emperor Sect that had left Star Emperor Mount for life experience, thoroughly offending this behemoth. As a result, one month later, Ancient Yang Sect had been razed to the ground and its headquarters became this strange place known as Grand Burial Valley.</p>
<p>Moreover, Dai Yuan also said that since then, many cultivators liked to come here to look for opportunities, because it was rumoured that although Ancient Yang Sect had been destroyed, there is still a Secret Cave left behind where most of this former great Sect’s accumulated wealth was hidden. Such rumours were enough to draw in treasure hunters from all over the world.</p>
<p>However, there are many still active Spirit Arrays in this place and the Yin Qi was incredibly thick, so many who came here seeking wealth actually lost their lives instead and the so-called Secret Cave had never been found. Over time, fewer and fewer people came here to try their luck.</p>
<p>Whether the Ancient Yang Sect had truly been wiped out by Star Emperor Sect was true or false, there was no conclusive proof.</p>
<p>Dai Yuan had personally visited this place but hadn’t gained anything. Instead, her body had suffered the invasion of an unusual cold aura that took much time and effort for her to resolve after returning to Coloured Glass Sect.</p>
<p>Yang Kai recalled what Dai Yuan said at the time as his expression fluctuated.</p>
<p>If this was really the Grand Burial Valley, then he would need to increase his vigilance. The people who came here in the past were not just Saint Kings, there were even Origin Realm Masters who had explored this place and fallen as a result. Yang Kai did not dare act carelessly even if he was confident in his own strength.</p>
<p>Could it be that ancient map fragments Yang Yan possessed was leading them to the location of Ancient Yang Sect’s Secret Cave? Considering this possibility, Yang Kai’s heart jumped, and he couldn’t help feeling a bit excited.</p>
<p>If this was really the case, they would really be able to solve the current poverty-stricken situation of Dragon Cave Mountain. After all, the treasury of a large Sect would undoubtedly contain amazing wealth.</p>
<p>While thinking so in his heart, Yang Kai maintained a calm look on his face.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao and others seemed to see that Yang Kai was thinking about something but didn’t interrupt his thoughts. Only after a long pause did Yang Kai take a deep breath and cup his fists to Chen Shi Tao, “Many thanks, Sister Chen. If I had not met Sister Chen this time, my companion and I might still be ignorant of where we were.”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao giggled, “You’re really quite carefree aren’t you, not even inquiring about where you before diving in to explore? Fortunately, your luck is quite good. Entering this place is quite dangerous, even for an Origin Returning Realm masters.”</p>
<p>A look of rebuke flashed across her face as if she was blaming Yang Kai for not cherishing his life.</p>
<p>Yang Kai could only let out a hollow laugh.</p>
<p>Seemingly just remembering something, Chen Shi Tao asked Yang Kai with utmost seriousness, “Little Brother Yang, don’t judge this place by the dangers you’ve encountered up until now. This place was once the site of the Ancient Yang Sect, and these grounds are just the outer periphery, so the Spirit Arrays here aren’t too powerful, but if you go deeper inside, the barriers will become far more powerful and won’t be so forgiving like the one which trapped my group of four.”</p>
<p>“Sister Chen,” Wang Yu Han suddenly cut in, “This friend just inadvertently broke into this place, so how could he intend to go deeper? Telling him these things is useless.”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao’s brow furrowed slightly, not even turning to address him as she continued looking at Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai said with a smile, “Since I now know that this is Grand Burial Valley, I will naturally not delve any deeper. En, I assume that you’ve come here for something important, so this Yang won’t delay you any further, goodbye!”</p>
<p>“Take care, Brother Yang!” Wang Yu Han smiled at Yang Kai, changing the way he addressed him to a friendlier one immediately, seemingly quite eager for him to depart.</p>
<p>Yang Kai shot him a glance out of the corner of his eye before curling his lips upwards slightly and calling out to Yang Yan and setting off together with her, his figure gradually fading away into the mist.</p>
<p>Looking at his increasingly estranged back, Chen Shi Tao opened her mouth and seemed to want to say something, but she eventually held her tongue, only letting out a sigh after he completely disappeared.</p>
<p>“Em, this Brother Yang indeed has some good luck,” Wang Yu Han nodded with a sneer, “Without knowing anything at all, he actually wandered into Grand Burial Valley. Fortunately, he ran into Sister Chen, otherwise, he wouldn’t even know how he died.”</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, you don’t seem to like him very much,” Chen Fan Lei asked in an almost naively honest tone.</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han chuckled, “It has nothing to do with like or dislike, I just can’t help looking down on people who rely solely on luck to survive. Senior Brother said before, luck can only get a person so far, next time, his luck might not be so good and result in his death.”</p>
<p>Saying so, he glanced over at Chen Shi Tao seemingly unintentionally, wanting to persuade her to agree with him, but Chen Shi Tao currently had an obviously unhappy look on her face, making Wang Yu Han feel extremely helpless.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao was naturally upset. It was quite rare to encounter a person like Yang Kai who carried a great destiny, so she had wanted to try inviting him to accompany them. After all, although the reason the four of them had come to Grand Burial Valley this time should not be too dangerous, there was always the chance of an accident happening. If Yang Kai was with them, they might able to rely on his luck to reduce this risk to a minimum.</p>
<p>How could she have known though that before she could ask, Yang Kai would depart. Wang Yu Han’s follow up only made her feel more annoyed.</p>
<p>“Ah, Senior Sister Chen,” Lu Ying, who hadn’t spoken until now, suddenly called out, “You forgot to ask where he came from again.”</p>
<p>When Chen Shi Tao heard this, her nose cramped and her rich peaks heaved up and down in exasperation.</p>
<p>Last time, she had wanted to ask Yang Kai about his origins, hoping it would give her more opportunities to become friends with him; however, after she had collected enough Saint Crystals, she found that Yang Kai had disappeared at some point and asking Chang Qi hadn’t produced any results. Chang Qi knew better than to disclose Yang Kai’s background clearly.</p>
<p>This was something Chen Shi Tao regretted deeply.</p>
<p>Now, after a rare coincidence had allowed her to meet him again, Chen Shi Tao should have asked Yang Kai clearly about his origins so she could pay him a visit later. If Wang Yu Han had not interrupted and distracted her, she definitely wouldn’t have missed this opportunity.</p>
<p>If she knew where Yang Kai lived at least, the next time Chen Shi Tao wanted to go out, she could have invited him to accompany her.</p>
<p>Rather than acting with others, she was more willing to work with Yang Kai, who was lucky.</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han constantly interrupting her conversation with Yang Kai and making her forget about this matter, annoyed her greatly, causing Chen Shi Tao to shoot him a harsh glare. However, the other side simply welcomed her gaze, and even put on a somewhat flattering appearance, causing Chen Shi Tao to quickly lose interest and wave her hand, “Let’s go, we need to find that Thunder Pond as soon as possible so Fan Lei can break through his bottleneck.”</p>
<p>Saying so, she set out again. Lu Ying naturally understood why Chen Shi Tao was so disgruntled right now and shot Wang Yu Han a disapproving glance before hurriedly following her Senior Sister.</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei seemed a bit airheaded and did not notice anything wrong, just following after his sister happily while Wang Yu Han stood in place and glared in the direction Yang Kai had departed.</p>
<p>Although the Extreme Path Sect he and Chen Fan Lei came from was not a small force, compared to Clear Sky Sect it was still somewhat dwarfed, that was why he had long been interested in the sister of his Junior Brother. Chen Shi Tao had outstanding looks, especially her watery, enchanting eyes which seemed capable of capturing one’s soul. Every time Chen Fan Lei returned to his family home; Wang Yu Han would find an excuse to tag along so he could meet Chen Shi Tao. He wanted to appeal to her in hopes of moving her heart.</p>
<h2>1292</h2>
<p>Chapter 1292, Continuing Deeper</p>
<p>If he could really obtain this woman, Wang Yu Han would not only have a beautiful flower to accompany him in the future, perhaps he could even use her to enter Clear Sky Sect.</p>
<p>However, after meeting several times, and making clear his intentions towards her, Chen Shi Tao still did not show any favour towards him. Gradually, Wang Yu Han lost heart and no longer planned to get entangled with her again, lest he truly annoy her.</p>
<p>But the last time he chatted with his Junior Brother Chen Fan Lei, he accidentally heard some shocking news from him.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao now had a net worth in the millions of Saint Crystals and also possessed several high-quality Origin Grade High-Rank artifacts!</p>
<p>It seemed that she obtained these riches when she entered the Flowing Flame Sand Field. According to Chen Fan Lei, his sister had gotten extremely lucky and discovered a Saint Crystal lode, allowing her to collect a massive quantity of Saint Crystals. Later, although she had to turn over the vast majority to her Sect, she still managed to retain a hefty sum and the Clear Sky Sect Elders also rewarded her for her contribution with many artifacts and pills.</p>
<p>In particular, the Origin Grade High-Rank artifacts were given to Chen Shi Tao by the Great Elder of Clear Sky Sect personally!</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei was not one to have hidden intentions and was seemingly born carefree. His relationship with Wang Yu Han was good, so he had not had any reservations speaking about this subject with him; however, the latter was a different story, and after hearing about her sudden rise in status and wealth, Wang Yu Han once again decided to aim for Chen Shi Tao.</p>
<p>The purpose of this trip was actually for Chen Fan Lei to use a Thunder Pond to help him break through a bottleneck he was facing in his cultivation, but when Wang Yu Han heard about this, he urged his Junior Brother to invite Chen Shi Tao along. Everything had gone smoothly; hearing that her little brother needed help breaking through his bottleneck, Chen Shi Tao, as a supportive older sister, naturally agreed to help, even bringing along Lu Ying from Clear Sky Sect as backup. All four of them met up outside Grand Burial Valley before entering this place together.</p>
<p>Initially, things were going well, but then their group had accidentally fallen into the reflecting barrier and been trapped for two days. It was then that the little brat named Yang Kai had appeared and seeing Chen Shi Tao pay so much attention to him, Wang Yu Han naturally became vigilant and even targeted him slightly.</p>
<p>But now it seems that his way of doing things had irritating Chen Shi Tao, so Wang Yu Han stood in place somberly for a moment before helplessly shaking his head and following after the other three towards the Thunder Pond while secretly pondering what method he should use to impress Chen Shi Tao and win her affection.</p>
<p>After a moment, he indeed came up with an idea, and one that he thought would go well, immediately smiling while he began looking for an opportunity to implement his new plan.</p>
<p>On the other side, after separating from Chen Shi Tao and her group, Yang Kai took Yang Yan back along the route they had travelled and only stopped after withdrawing a couple of dozen kilometres.</p>
<p>“This is Grand Burial Valley?” After listening to Yang Kai’s explanation, Yang Yan not only did not panic but instead showed a joyful, eager look.</p>
<p>“What do you want to do?” Yang Kai asked with a frown, suddenly having a bad premonition.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. I was just thinking that if this is really the former site of a great Sect, it must be covered with many powerful barriers and Spirit Arrays!” Yang Yan’s beautiful eyes lit up with a strange light as she shot a look of excitement towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Gently rubbing his forehead, Yang Kai said, “Since we’re already here, I don’t have any intentions of just leaving, but what about the directions on those two map fragments? If it doesn’t point to the inner recesses, then there’s no need for us to take unnecessary risks.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, then I’ll have to disappoint you, the direction these fragments indicate really is towards the depths of this place, but you can rest assured that there is no barrier or Spirit Array in this world I cannot break. If there were people still living here tending to these Spirit Arrays, I wouldn’t be able to make any guarantees, but only dilapidated barriers that cannot display their full might remain now, so how could they pose any problems?” Yang Yan said with great confidence.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai also felt somewhat inspire and nodded, “Fine. Since you’re so confident, let’s continued deeper and see if the place marked on the map fragments is the so-called Secret Cave of the Ancient Yang Sect. If it is, then we should be able to find enough riches to allow you to purchase any Artifact Refining and Spirit Array materials you want!”</p>
<p>Yang Yan’s eyes lit up and immediately began urging Yang Kai to lead the way.</p>
<p>The pair took a long detour so they would not run into Chen Shi Tao’s groups before continuing deeper into the ruins.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao was right about one thing though. Around the periphery, the barriers and Spirit Arrays they encountered were not very powerful; in fact, the strongest Spirit Array in the vicinity was likely the one that had trapped their group of four. However, all of these Spirit Arrays were easily dismantled by Yang Yan, taking anywhere from a dozen breaths to the time it would take to burn a stick of incense.</p>
<p>Yang Kai and Yang Yan could basically walk about unimpeded.</p>
<p>Five days later, the pair seemed to enter the inner reaches of Ancient Yang Sect, because here, broken walls and ruins could be seen everywhere. It seemed that there were once many, many buildings here but at some point, all of them had been destroyed.</p>
<p>The barriers and Spirit Arrays here were also much more powerful than before, so Yang Yan had to spend some time to carefully crack them.</p>
<p>On top of that, these Spirit Arrays were quite old, and some had become very unstable, causing Yang Yan to run into some unexpected situations when taking them apart. Yang Kai was responsible for her safety during this time.</p>
<p>Yang Kai originally wanted to search through these ruins to see if there was anything of value left, but he soon gave up on this unrealistic idea.</p>
<p>Grand Burial Valley had existed for over two thousand years and, during this time, countless cultivators had searched through this place, so even if there had been treasures left here at one point, anything good must have already fallen into other’s hands.</p>
<p>On this day, Yang Yan stared at a huge open space in front of her for a moment before suddenly raising her hands and taking out two strange-looking artifacts which quickly flew forward and seemingly disappeared into thin air.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t find this strange though as he had witnessed similar scenes multiple times already. Standing behind Yang Yan, he quietly circulated his Saint Qi and prepared to act at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>Yang Yan closed her eyes for a while but soon a smile appeared at the corner of her lips and she turned around to Yang Kai and said, “There’s a big Spirit Array here, I’m afraid it will take some time to crack.”</p>
<p>“Can we go around it?”</p>
<p>“No!” Yang Yan looked at Yang Kai imploringly, “Well, yes, we can go around it, but this is a rare type of Spirit Array and I really want to study and crack it. I told you before that as long as I keep arranging Spirit Arrays and Artifact Refining, I will be able to unlock more and more knowledge about these subjects from my memories, yes? This is a good opportunity then, because breaking through these Spirit Arrays benefits me just as much as refining my own Artifacts or arranging Spirit Arrays. Doing it this way will save us a lot of money and materials don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai shook his head helplessly and asked cautiously, “Will there be any danger?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not!” Yang Yan swung her head like a rattle.</p>
<p>“Alright... how long will it take you to crack it?” Yang Kai asked</p>
<p>“Two or three days. You can do whatever you like during that time,” Yang Yan spat out her tongue before immediately ignoring Yang Kai and immersing herself in studying the big Spirit Array in front of her.</p>
<p>Seeing her like this, Yang Kai didn’t go to disturb her and after thinking about what to do for a moment, he took out the Origin King Grade High-Rank Artifact Refining Furnace and in a flash made it expand to three metres or so in diameter.</p>
<p>Yang Kai sat down cross-legged in front of this furnace and sent his Divine Sense into it. Soon after, a high-pitched cry rang out and the Firebird Artifact Spirit flew out of the Artifact Refining Furnace, circled it a few times, then came to a hover just above it and began spraying out pure Fire Attribute energy from its mouth in order to assist with refining the Dragon Bone and Dragon Bead inside.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not remain idle either and actively poured his Saint Qi into the Artifact Refining Furnace to enhance its power while at the same time he split his attention to continue cultivating his Golden Blood Threads.</p>
<p>Whether it was cultivating his Golden Blood Thread technique or refining the Dragon Bone and Dragon Bead, both were incredibly time-consuming processes so having found a spare moment now, Yang Kai was not about to waste it.</p>
<p>So, he didn’t object to Yang Yan cracking the Spirit Array here, if he didn’t have anything to do, he wouldn’t have agreed.</p>
<p>Time passed by, yet Yang Kai barely noticed. At some point though, while immersed in cultivating his Golden Blood Threads, a slight noise suddenly came from beside him, causing him to look up and see some fluctuating rays of light and a disturbance in the ambient World Energy. Yang Yan was smiling as she stood nearby, putting away the tools she had been using until now one by one.</p>
<p>A short time later, all the lights faded, and Yang Kai felt that something had disappeared from the open space nearby, immediately understanding that the large Spirit Array arranged here had been cracked by Yang Yan.</p>
<p>With a thought, he received his Artifact Refining Furnace and Artifact Spirit, got up, and asked, “Done?”</p>
<p>“En, let’s move on. I’m beginning to like this place more and more. Last time, I should have entered the Flowing Flame Sand Field with you. I heard that there were many Spirit Arrays there.”</p>
<p>“If you had come in with me, you would probably be disappointed. Although there were some barriers there, there weren’t many... En, I did see a giant ruin of an ancient Sect though, one that seemed nearly completely intact at that. It probably would have met your requirements.”</p>
<p>Yang Yan sighed, “Unfortunately I didn’t have an opportunity, and there’s no telling how many years it will be until the next time the Flowing Flame Sand Field opens.”</p>
<p>The two continued walking while talking.</p>
<p>As they continued deeper into the ruins, the Spirit Arrays and barriers they encountered really became much stronger and the time it took Yang Yan to crack them also grew longer, unlike in the periphery where she could dismantle them with ease.</p>
<p>Even so, Yang Kai could not help feeling quite shocked. Although they had been left unattended for many years, these Spirit Arrays were still the crystallization of a great Sect’s knowledge and resources, yet they were continuously being broken by Yang Yan. Yang Kai really wondered what the people who had arranged these barriers would think if they were to learn about this.</p>
<p>On top of that, Yang Kai noticed that each time Yang Yan deciphered one of these Spirit Arrays, she would wear a giant smile; obviously, she was gaining many benefits from this process.</p>
<p>This point alone made the trip they had taken worthwhile; after all, Yang Yan cracked these Spirit Arrays not only allowed her to unlock more of her memories, it also saved Dragon Cave Mountain a lot of money.</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai did not obtain anything, he also didn’t lose anything, and he could even take advantage of this opportunity to work on his own projects.</p>
<p>Yang Kai even secretly thought that if they weren’t able to earn enough Saint Crystals to buy materials for her in the future, he could always take Yang Yan out to look for similar places to let her crack Spirit Arrays.</p>
<p>With Shadowed Star being so enormous, there should be many places like this Grand Burial Valley.</p>

<p>Chapter 1293, Corpse Soldier</p>

<p>Inside Grand Burial Valley, Yang Yan stood on the spot, looking at the two map fragments in her hands, her expression flickering, because these two map fragments had led her here but there were no further instructions beyond that.</p>
<p>Relying on just these two map fragments to reach this point was all thanks to Yang Yan incredible analytical abilities, but now she was unable to determine the final position they were guiding her towards, only that their destination was somewhere within the surrounding thousand-kilometre radius.</p>
<p>A thousand-kilometre range was neither big nor small, but it would be very time-consuming to find some kind of hidden location.</p>
<p>While the Spirit Arrays they encountered as they moved deeper did not bother Yang Yan, the Yin Qi had become extremely rich and resisting it was constantly consuming her Saint Qi. Thankfully, Yang Kai had huge reserves of Saint Qi in his body so he could cover for Yang Yan when she became exhausted. If this weren’t the case, the two would have had to retreat long ago.</p>
<p>“What should we do?” Yang Yan turned her head to look at Yang Kai. They had come so far already so she was naturally unwilling to just give up. If she tried diligently, perhaps she could find the ultimate destination marked on these map fragments, but everything would depend on Yang Kai’s opinion.</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned and grumbled to himself. Although they hadn’t encountered much danger along the way, since two days ago, the Yin Souls that had attacked them had strength equivalent to ordinary Saint Kings, and some of those that had been absorbing the Yin Qi of this place for countless years had even begun to achieve a slight degree of sentience, making them far more difficult to deal with as they would immediately retreat if they felt they were in danger, then, after recuperating, would come back to attack again. Thankfully, Yang Kai’s strength was still far greater, allowing him to thoroughly destroy most of these Yin Souls otherwise the situation would have been far more troublesome.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was also beginning to vaguely sense that there were more dangers to this Grand Burial Valley than could be seen on the surface. After all, if there weren’t, there wouldn’t be rumours about Origin Returning Realm masters falling here.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a moment, Yang Kai asked, “If I say we need to go back now, would you feel unwilling?”</p>
<p>Yang Yan nodded honestly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai grinned and nodded back, “I am also unwilling, and since that is the case, let’s keep looking. In any case, it’s just a five-hundred-kilometre search radius, at worst we can just dig up the entire thousand-kilometre region.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yang Yan’s spirit immediately rose, and the pair immediately began scouring the nearby area.</p>
<p>One day later, Yang Kai paused suddenly and looked around in surprise. Yang Yan saw this and naturally knew that he had discovered something, so she immediately fell silent and waited. Only after some time did Yang Kai show a strange look and ask, “Do you smell something strange?”</p>
<p>“En, it’s like there’s a faint rotten odor in the air,” Yang Yan responded, obviously also having noticed this.</p>
<p>“So, it wasn’t just my imagination,” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully, a black fireball suddenly appearing in his palm and unleashing such intense heat that the surrounding space began to warp.</p>
<p>Swiftly, Yang Kai waved his hand and threw this black fireball towards a nearby dead tree.</p>
<p>This fireball was not very fast, but just as it was about to hit the seemingly unremarkable dead tree, a low roar suddenly rang out from it. Along with this bestial roar, and rich malevolent aura also erupted.</p>
<p>With a loud bang, the dead tree exploded into dust under the strong force erupting from inside it and a tall, abnormal figure suddenly appeared in its place.</p>
<p>A big hand suddenly stretched forward, covered in a light-yellow aura, and instantly intercepted the black fireball.</p>
<p>There was a loud sizzling sound the moment the pale yellow aura made contact with the black fireball, as if a handful of salt was sprinkled into a hot pan of oil. The yellow aura rapidly faded, but the Demonic Flame also grew weaker as a result.</p>
<p>A short time later, the pale yellow aura and the black fireball completely disappeared, leaving behind the strange tall figure in front of Yang Kai and Yang Yan.</p>
<p>After seeing the face of this person, Yang Kai’s brow furrowed as a look of shock filled his face while Yang Yan exclaimed loudly, “A Corpse Soldier!”</p>
<p>“Corpse Soldier?” Yang Kai turned his head to look at her curiously as this was the first time he had heard of such an existence. The tall, abnormal figure opposite him was clearly not a living person. Its face was shriveled and seemed devoid of any kind of moisture and its skin had sunk in, exposing the outlines of its bones. Two green eyes flickered like flames and its face was abnormally thin. Its appearance was quite terrifying and would cause anyone who saw it to shudder.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, Yang Kai was unable to feel any vitality from it, only a thick Death Qi and Corpse Qi. If not for this odd body emitting aura fluctuations on par with those of an average Third-Order Saint King, Yang Kai would really have thought it was just a corpse.</p>
<p>However, this corpse-like figure in front of him had just neutralized his Demonic Flame fireball with a single blow without taking any apparent damage.</p>
<p>The rancid smell that Yang Kai and Yang Yan had smelt was clearly being emitted by this figure but because it was hidden inside the dead tree a moment ago, it wasn’t so obvious.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“You can think of him as a special kind of life-form!”</p>
<p>“A life-form?” Yang Kai’s brow rose, and he wanted to ask more, but the Corpse Soldier opposite them suddenly showed a strange expression, one that seemed similar to a grin but because of its shrivelled face looked particularly strange and ugly. Immediately, a hoarse voice came from its throat, “Ah, excellent. Two big supplements delivered themselves to me. En, and one is a fresh little girl with tender flesh, her flavour will certainly be scrumptious.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yang Yan shivered involuntarily and quickly hid behind Yang Kai.</p>
<p>The look of surprise on Yang Kai’s face quickly disappeared. Since Yang Yan said that this Corpse Soldier was a lifeform, then naturally it would possess sentience and it would not be surprising for it to speak. It was his first time encountering such a strange creature, but when Yang Kai thought about all the Yin Souls here, he was no longer surprising that this Corpse Soldier had appeared.</p>
<p>Also grinning, Yang Kai looked at him and asked, “You want to eat my companion?”</p>
<p>“Do you have any objections?” The Corpse Soldier looked at Yang Kai coldly, a dangerous light flashing across its green eyes, “Rest assured, you also won’t escape, I’ll be eating both of you.”</p>
<p>“You want to eat me too?” Yang Kai seemed to hear something funny, his face turning cold as he snorted, “I’m afraid your teeth will break!”</p>
<p>As soon as his voice fell, with the wave of his hand, Yang Kai condensed a black sword and immediately slashed forward, sending out an imposing black sword wave that sliced cleanly through the air.</p>
<p>The Corpse Soldier didn’t show any fear at all, instead releasing a hoarse laughter as he crossed its arms in front of its chest. The pale yellow aura from just before enveloped it once again as it met the sword wave head on.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s gaze become colder but he didn’t make any follow-up actions, simply observing for the moment.</p>
<p>Yang Kai saw his sword wave strike his opponent’s arms head on, but this only resulted in the Corpse Solider being forced back a few steps and the pale yellow aura guarding him fade slightly. There was also a burst of crisp scraping noises, like metal clashing against metal.</p>
<p>“Corpse Soldiers have extremely strong physical bodies incomparable to cultivators in the same realm, not much different from defensive artifacts of the same level,” Yang Yan’s reminder came from behind.</p>
<p>“I see!” Yang Kai gently nodded.</p>
<p>“Little girl, you seem to know a lot about us. Kaka, boy you will be the first. I’ll take my time to enjoy her later!” The Corpse Soldier cackled again before rushing out, the jet black nails on its big shriveled hand extending and releasing a cold light as it clawed towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>As it reached out, the sound of air being split rang out and it seemed as though it wanted to twist off Yang Kai’s head.</p>
<p>Yang Kai raised his hand and sent out a punch to greet this big open hand.</p>
<p>“Overconfidence!” The Corpse Soldier saw Yang Kai wanted to face him with just his fist and sneered, grasping with its claw-like hand as if it wanted to crush Yang Kai’s outstretched fist.</p>
<p>But to the Corpse Soldier’s shock, when it tried to crush Yang Kai’s seemingly frail fist, he discovered that it was actually incomparably firm, and even though he used at least seventy percent of his strength, he was unable to even cut into his opponent’s skin.</p>
<p>On the contrary, a huge force came from his opponent’s fist, causing his green eyes to shrink, and with a strange cry, the Corpse Soldier’s body flew out like a paper kite as a look of shock filled his face.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was also shocked as he was forced back a few steps. He felt an icy coldness on his fist and when he looked down, he actually saw five black finger prints on the back of his hand which were exuding a thick Black Qi. This Black Qi seemed to be alive and was constantly wriggling back and forth, trying to dig into his flesh.</p>
<p>“Be careful of his Corpse Qi, it’s extremely virulent. Once it invades your body it’s extremely difficult to get rid of,” Yang Yan’s timely reminder sounded.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face went cold as he changed the Demonic Flames in his body into a pure hot existence.</p>
<p>The squirming Black Qi seemed to meet its nemesis and after a burst of what sounded like wailing was ejected from Yang Kai’s hand and dissipated into the air.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Yan finally calmed down. What made Corpse Soldiers difficult to deal with were their solid bodies and strange Corpse Qi, but since Yang Kai was not affected by either, there was nothing she needed to worry about.</p>
<p>Sure enough, seeing Yang Kai easily expel his Corpse Qi, the eyes of the Corpse Soldier who hit the ground rolling became somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p>Originally, in his mind, the Second-Order Saint King Yang Kai and Yang Yan were not his opponents at all. He would quickly defeat these two then devour their bodies to enhance his own strength.</p>
<p>This was not the first or second time he had done this, but this time’s Second-Order Saint King was different from those he had encountered before and seemed quite difficult to kill.</p>
<p>This made him wonder if he should continue struggling here.</p>
<p>While he was hesitant though, Yang Kai had no intention of letting him off. With a flick of his wrist, Yang Kai silently sent a golden silk thread flying over that swiftly struck towards the Corpse Soldier. This Corpse Soldier did not notice this golden thread until it was already upon him and with a loud roar it sprayed out a thick Corpse Qi from his mouth to intercept it.</p>
<h2>1294</h2>
<p>Chapter 1294, Nested Array</p>
<p>In an instant, the thick Corpse Qi shrouded the golden silk thread, but what surprised the Corpse Soldier was that his normally formidable Corpse Qi simply had no effect on this thin golden thread. The golden silk thread also seemed to have spirituality and contained an astonishing amount of vitality. With a quick flick, it shook off the Corpse Qi and then proceeded to pierce straight through the Corpse Soldier’s abnormally sturdy body as if it was tofu.</p>
<p>The golden thread then coiled around the Corpse Solider a few times and bound him tightly.</p>
<p>This Corpse Soldier instantly became terrified, but before he could take any kind of defensive action, Yang Kai released a pitch-black blade-like attack towards him. This blade did not give off any kind of energy fluctuation but upon seeing it, the green flame like eyes of the Corpse Soldier bulged as he sensed great danger from it.</p>
<p>In a flurry, he twisted his figure and managed to avoid a hit to his vitals, allowing the black blade-like attack to instead land on one of his arms.</p>
<p>An incredibly strange scene appeared next though, as his arm silently fell from his body. There was also a small portion of his arm missing where the cut had taken place, so the wound on his body and the fallen arm did not match exactly.</p>
<p>Naturally, it was Yang Kai’s Space Blade.</p>
<p>Although the Corpse Soldier’s physical body was unusually strong, Yang Kai’s Space Blade was also incredibly powerful as it could swallow anything it cut into The Void. The small missing section of the Corpse Soldier’s arm had been forever exiled to The Void.</p>
<p>When Yang Kai observed this cut though, there was only a light green liquid that was leaking out and no trace of blood at all, appearing quite strange.</p>
<p>Even so, the Corpse Soldier seemed to have suffered serious harm and a mournful wail escaped from its mouth, Corpse Qi erupting from its body and quickly engulfing it.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was just about to finish it off, but a look of horror suddenly came over his face and with a hurried wave of his hand, the golden thread which was binding the Corpse Soldier flew back to him.</p>
<p>The Corpse Soldier had regained his freedom and from within his shroud of Corpse Qi, he glared at Yang Kai fiercely before grabbing the fallen segment of his arm and transformed into a yellow streak of light, escaping at a surprisingly fast speed.</p>
<p>Yang Kai stood somberly in place as he stared down at his Golden Blood Thread and noticed that it had been horribly contaminated with Black Qi.</p>
<p>Because he had only been cultivating his Golden Thread technique for a short time, Yang Kai was unable to display its full power; if he had been skillfully use it, this kind of contamination would never have occurred. Having been bound by the Golden Blood Thread, despite having incredible strength, the Corpse Soldier should have been easily killed by Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Flicking his wrist, Yang Kai withdrew the Golden Thread into his body and condensed his Saint Qi around it to purge the residual Corpse Qi. At the same time, he grabbed Yang Yan by her shoulder and chased after the Corpse Soldier as quick as lightning.</p>
<p>The confrontation between Yang Kai and Corpse Soldier was over in the blink of an eye, so Yang Yan had yet to even react before this enemy she regarded as quite dangerous escaped in a panic. Only after they were already pursing it did she come to her sense and begin explaining the origins of this Corpse Soldier to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Through her remarks, Yang Kai realized that this Corpse Soldier was just a classification in a hierarchy of similar creatures.</p>
<p>Just like Yin Souls, Corpse Soldiers could only be born in environments rich in Yin Qi. When a living cultivator or creature died here, under a combination of chance and opportunity, its Soul and flesh would not just wither away but instead transform into a different kind of existence. This is what a Corpse Soldier was.</p>
<p>Of course, some Corpse Soldiers were not formed this way but were instead the result of a Yin Soul reaching a certain degree of strength and sentience and then seizing the body of a living creature. This would result in a Corpse Soldier-like existence.</p>
<p>Corpse Soldiers could also artificially be created through evil Secret Arts. On Shadowed Star, there were many Sects that possessed these kinds of evil arts.</p>
<p>However, in general, the formation of a Corpse Soldier was far more difficult than that of a Yin Soul. If the conditions were right, any disembodied Soul that didn’t disperse could transform into a Yin Soul. On the other hand, Corpse Soldiers required both the Soul and flesh body to endure after death and re-integrate with one another. This significantly increased the difficulty of a Corpse Soldier forming.</p>
<p>These creatures could roughly be divided into three levels, Hundred-Year Corpse Soldiers, Thousand-Year Corpse Generals, and Ten-Thousand-Year Corpse Kings!</p>
<p>Needless to say, Hundred-Year Corpse Soldiers had an extremely difficult time cultivating because they were essentially undead and could not easily absorb World Qi. As such, they cultivated many times slower than living creatures on average. It was not unusual for a Corpse Soldier that cultivated for a few hundred years to be inferior to an ordinary Saint King Realm cultivator.</p>
<p>However, the strength of a Corpse Soldier was far superior to others in the same equivalent realm. This was true all the way from the Initial Element Stage all the way to the Saint King Realm.</p>
<p>The Corpse Soldier Yang Kai encountered just now was an existence equivalent to the peak of the Saint King Realm. It had probably taken seven or eight hundred years of cultivation for it to reach this kind of level.</p>
<p>Once a Corpse Soldier was promoted to a Thousand-Year Corpse General, it would have power on par with an Origin Returning Realm master. As for a legendary Ten-Thousand-Year Corpse King, it would be comparable to an Origin King Realm master. It could even be said that a Ten Thousand Year Corpse King was far more powerful than an ordinary Origin King because the flesh body of a ten-thousand-year-old Corpse King was almost indestructible.</p>
<p>As Yang Yan explained all of this in detail, Yang Kai was secretly shocked.</p>
<p>He had never contacted such strange creatures before and had never even heard about them from anyone. He had honestly never expected that there would be such a weird form a life in this world.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai was not an ordinary person and had seen many types of strange creatures before, so although he was a little interested in the indestructible body of a Ten Thousand Year Corpse King, after calming down, he didn’t show much surprise.</p>
<p>Along the way, Yang Kai did not know what strange means the Corpse Soldier used, but in a place some fifty kilometres ahead of them, it suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>Yang Kai released his Divine Sense but could not find any clues besides a faint trace of Corpse Qi that had been leaking from the damaged body of the Corpse Soldier.</p>
<p>Following this trail of Corpse Qi, Yang Kai and Yang Yan arrived in front of a collapsed ruin and upon looking around, they discovered that within a range of a dozen kilometres or so, there were many crumbled buildings. Obviously, this place had been a core region of this Sect, otherwise there wouldn’t have been so many buildings.</p>
<p>“There are traces of Spirit Arrays here,” Yang Yan’s eyes stared at what appeared to be an open square nearby with bright eyes, a smile soon creeping onto her face, “But it’s just a simple Illusion Array, nothing difficult to crack.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently nodded and motioned for her to do her thing.</p>
<p>Yang Yan once again took out her strange tools, filled them with her Saint Qi, and threw them out, causing them to disappear in the next moment.</p>
<p>After a stick of incense worth of time, the scene in front of Yang Yan distorted and soon transformed from an open square to a completely different set of ruins.</p>
<p>Before Yang Yan could even put down her hands though, a strange blast of energy rushed towards her and Yang Kai from all directions, blocking all paths of retreat.</p>
<p>“A Nested Array!” Yang Yan called out in alarm. Yang Kai responded very quickly, pulling Yang Yan behind him and summoning his Purple Shield, madly pouring his Saint Qi into it and immediately creating a wall of yellow sand and wind around them.</p>
<p>It was the sandstorm ability of the Purple Shield.</p>
<p>The waves of energy attacks hit the sandstorm and were blocked by the wind and sand. Although these attacks did not completely disappear, their power was greatly reduced, making them far less ferocious than before.</p>
<p>Yang Kai constantly waved his hands, releasing multiple black fireballs to resist the remnants of these energy attacks.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Yan calm down and hurriedly began surveying their surroundings. She had not expected that there would be a Nested Array here; after all, arranging such a series of concentric Spirit Arrays was quite difficult and also consumed a massive amount of materials. Even great Sects would not easily arrange this type of Spirit Array.</p>
<p>However, there was indeed such a Nested Array here, something which surprised Yang Yan and caused her vigilance to increase.</p>
<p>The attacks from the second Spirit Array were endless, and although they were not Heaven Destroying or Earth Shattering in power, they were enough to put Yang Kai completely on the defensive and even showed signs of overwhelming him in short order.</p>
<p>After a moment though, Yang Yan suddenly pointed to a small bronze gate in the ground smirked, “Hit that!”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yang Kai did not hesitate to release his Space Blade.</p>
<p>In an instant, the Space Blade cut this bronze gate in half. A buzzing sound resounded all around and the attacks all quickly ceased.</p>
<p>After waiting for a while to confirm that no more attacks were coming, Yang Kai withdrew his Purple Shield and looked around.</p>
<p>He thought that the Corpse Soldier that had fled before would be hiding somewhere nearby, but there was nothing in sight, causing him a great deal of doubt.</p>
<p>“This doesn’t make sense. This Spirit Array would be very troublesome even for me to crack, but the Corpse Soldier disappeared as soon as it entered here. It’s impossible for him to be the master of this Spirit Array,” Yang Yan frowned deeply, obviously unable to understand what had just happened.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s wore an uncertain expression as well as he hypothesized, “Could he have simply known a safe route through this Spirit Array?”</p>
<p>“Impossible,” Yang Yan shook her head decisively, “Unless he was an Array Grandmaster before his death, he wouldn’t be able to accomplish that even if he was far stronger. Of course, if he was a disciple of this Sect before he died, he might be able to control the Spirit Array here, but he is just a Corpse Soldier that cultivated for a few hundred years while the Ancient Yang Sect was destroyed over two thousand years ago, so it’s impossible for him to be one of their disciples.”</p>
<p>“Whatever the case, he must still be here,” Yang Kai grinned, “Not to mention, with this place being so well hidden, don’t you think it might be the place we’ve been looking for?”</p>
<p>“You mean, as long as we can find where he’s hiding, we’ll also complete our original objective?” Yang Yan suddenly remembered their purpose in coming here and asked excitedly.</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Yang Kai replied.</p>
<p>The two exchanged a glance before immediately beginning to search their surroundings.</p>
<p>After half an hour, the pair stood in front of a certain ruin. This place appeared unremarkable at first glance, but if one looked carefully, they would notice that unlike everywhere else, there were some slight distortions in space here.</p>
<p>There was another barrier here, but this one only had some concealment ability and no offensive power. Fortunately, Yang Yan had profound attainments in Spirit Arrays, otherwise, they might not have discovered it.</p>
<h2>1295</h2>
<p>Chapter 1295, Corpse Cave</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>The more hidden the barrier was, the more Yang Kai affirmed his previous guess was correct.</p>
<p>After staring at this barrier for some time, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly changed and he waved his hand, summoning out the Origin King Grade Artifact Refining Furnace, tapping it with his finger, and lightning saying, “Go in and take a look around!”</p>
<p>With a light cry, the Firebird Artifact Spirit flew out of the Artifact Refining Furnace and plunged towards the barrier without the slightest hesitation. When the Artifact Spirit touched the barrier, the surrounding space shook for an instant before the Firebird disappeared entirely.</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned for a moment, but after confirming that his connection with the Artifact Spirit still existed, he relaxed.</p>
<p>Standing on the spot, Yang Kai carefully reviewed the information passed back to him from the Artifact Spirit, his expression uncertain. Only after some time did he say, “It looks like we were right, this is definitely a Cave Heaven, and the World Energy aura inside is quite astonishing. It’s likely the place we are looking for.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Yang Yan was overjoyed.</p>
<p>“But... the Corpse Qi inside is also quite dense. It seems that more than one Corpse Soldier lives here,” Yang Kai said, solemnly dignified.</p>
<p>Yang Yan was dumbfounded and a look of hesitation appeared on her face. If there was only one Corpse Soldier, with Yang Kai’s strength, there would not be anything to fear, but if there were many of them, Yang Kai wouldn’t be able to handle them all on his own. This situation required some careful consideration.</p>
<p>It took a while for Yang Yan to finally say, “Since this is the site of the Ancient Yang Sect, it means that these Corpse Soldiers appeared after its destruction. It is very likely that many of them were disciples of the Ancient Yang Sect and only because of some coincidences they became like this after they died. In other words, the most powerful existence here would be a two-thousand-year-old Corpse General, equivalent to a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm at best.”</p>
<p>“A Second-Order Origin Returning Realm master,” Yang Kai murmured with a look of contemplation.</p>
<p>If this was the case, he didn’t need to worry. He didn’t have the strength necessary to fight such a powerful Corpse General, but escaping together with Yang Yan wouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>After a moment of contemplation, Yang Kai made a decision and gently nodded, “Then let’s go in.”</p>
<p>If the only thing he noticed inside this place was the thick Corpse Qi, Yang Kai would surely have turned around and left. Although he wasn’t afraid of a Thousand-Year Corpse General, avoiding an unnecessary fight would still be for the best. However, in addition to the thick Corpse Qi, the World Energy inside was also extremely rich, so clearly there were some good things hidden inside.</p>
<p>He and Yang Yan had come all this way, so with their goal now right in front of them, naturally they were unwilling to just give up.</p>
<p>Saying so, Yang Kai released his Saint Qi and wrapped himself and Yang Yan within it before leading her forward.</p>
<p>After stepping into past the Concealment Array, the world seemed to spin for a moment and the scene in front of them changed dramatically. Yang Kai and Yang Yan now found themselves inside a cave-like place that seemed to have a faint wailing sound echoing through the air, causing one to shudder unconsciously.</p>
<p>Along the cave walls, there were many green fluorescent stones, emitting a somewhat ghastly light.</p>
<p>Inside this cave though, the World Energy aura was incredibly rich, and Yang Kai could even smell a subtle medicinal fragrance. His heart trembled as he realized that he and Yang Yan had really found the right place, those two ancient map fragments had really led to the Secret Cave of the Ancient Yang Sect.</p>
<p>Although the light in this cave wasn’t very bright, with Yang Kai’s cultivation, as soon as he concentrated some Saint Qi into his eyes, he could still see everything in front of him perfectly. At the same time, he quietly released his Divine Sense to monitor their surroundings. Yang Kai soon found that this cave had traces of artifact excavation. It seemed that it was a naturally formed several thousand-metre deep cave that was later processed to make it more spacious.</p>
<p>In the deepest depths of this cave, there were also many channels extending in multiple directions, but where each of these channels lead, Yang Kai didn’t know. Yang Kai traced one of these tunnels with a thread of his Divine Sense for about thirty kilometres before his face suddenly changed, a look of horror filling his expression.</p>
<p>“What did you find?” Yang Yan asked softly.</p>
<p>“Shh!” Yang Kai quickly raised his finger to his lips as he quietly withdrew his thread of Divine Sense, whispering to Yang Yan a moment later, “Corpse Soldiers, lots of them.”</p>
<p>Yang Yan beautiful face paled.</p>
<p>Yang Kai quickly added, “But they seem to be in a state of hibernation. We should be fine as long as we’re careful not to disturb them.”</p>
<p>“How many are there?” Yang Yan asked nervously with a pale face.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure, I only probed one of the channels down below and found seven or eight Corpse Soldiers, but there were at least a hundred channels down there. If every channel is the same as the one I probed, then...”</p>
<p>“This place is probably a Corpse Cave!” Yang Yan seemed to remember something and declared.</p>
<p>“A Corpse Cave?” Yang Kai frowned.</p>
<p>“En, there rumours of some special places that are able to easily give rise to Corpse Soldiers, and if Corpse Soldiers slumber in such places, they can more easily merge their Soul and flesh body to obtain sentience. If this is really a Corpse Cave, it’s a very dangerous place.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if this place is a Corpse Cave, but the Corpse Qi deeper inside is indeed quite rich and the chill in the air is also extremely potent. Those sleeping Corpse Soldiers were also absorbing the Yin Qi in the air from what I could see.”</p>
<p>“If that’s so, this is definitely a Corpse Cave,” Yang Yan was startled and quickly muttered, “With so many Corpse Soldiers here, it’s likely that only part of them were disciples of the Ancient Yang Sect while another part were cultivators that were later killed and entombed here. It seems we’ve come to quite a terrible place.”</p>
<p>“Since we’re already here, there’s no point in thinking too much about it,” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully, and with a quick thought, a streak of flame flew over from afar and soon dove into Yang Kai’s body, disappearing in the next instant. Obviously it was the Artifact Spirit he had released to scout the situation before.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Yan clenched her teeth and once again activated her necklace artifact. This time though, the concealment halo of this necklace not only wrapped around her, but also around Yang Kai as well.</p>
<p>In an instant, both of their auras disappeared.</p>
<p>The two exchanged a glance and nodded before quietly moving forward.</p>
<p>Since the Corpse Soldiers down below were in a deep sleep, they weren’t a cause for concern. The only thing that made Yang Kai a little worried was the Saint King Grade Corpse Soldier he had wounded before that was still hidden somewhere. Yang Kai also didn’t dare to freely investigate this place, so he was unable to find this wounded Corpse Soldier immediately.</p>
<p>As the pair passed by some of the tunnel offshoots, they clearly noticed a burgeoning Corpse Qi as well as some non-negligible noises coming from the inside, but these noises were orderly and rhythmic so it was obvious that without some great external shock, the slumbering Corpse Soldiers wouldn’t awaken.</p>
<p>Whenever passing by these tunnels, Yang Yan couldn’t help moving closer to Yang Kai, as if she was subconsciously looking for some sense of security.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Yang Yan’s artifacts were all superb and the two had plenty of preparation, so no trace of their auras leaked out.</p>
<p>While the two of them were continuing their exploration though, deep inside the Corpse Cave three skinny Corpse Soldiers were sitting cross-legged on the ground, circulating some kind of strange Secret Art that allowed them to inhale the surrounding white gas and strengthen their bodies.</p>
<p>These three Corpse Soldiers all emitted auras equivalent to peak Third-Order Saint Kings.</p>
<p>In a flash, another Corpse Soldier suddenly entered this passageway looking extremely disheveled. One of his arms had been cut off at the elbow, making him appear quite miserable.</p>
<p>As soon as he appeared, he was noticed by the other three Corpse Soldiers who opened their eyes to look at him. In an instant, six ghostly green eyes flashed.</p>
<p>“Oh, Brother Nie, how did you become like this?” One of the Corpse Soldiers saw his companion’s broken arm and asked in surprise, “Did you encounter some kind of danger outside?”</p>
<p>The eyes of the wounded Corpse Soldier flashed with anger as he grits his teeth and said, “I truly encounter some danger, and in a moment of carelessness, my arm was cut off!”</p>
<p>“Such a thing actually happened!?” The Corpse Soldier who had spoken just now called out in surprised, “After so many years, did an Origin Realm cultivator enter Grand Burial Valley? Did you run into such a master?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t an Origin Returning Realm master, it was just a Second-Order Saint King,” The wounded Corpse Soldier said, seemingly a little ashamed, “This Nie let his guard down and was unexpectedly injured heavily.”</p>
<p>“Haha, Brother Nie must be joking. If we were still humans, such an injury would be very difficult to heal, but in our current state, a cut off arm isn’t even worth worrying about. As long as you use a bit of time and circulate your Corpse Qi you should be able to re-attach it in short order.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that Brother Nie’s injury can’t be healed so simply,” Another Corpse Soldier with long hair said in an unexpectedly pleasant to the ear voice after seemingly noticing something. This Corpse Soldier actually turned out to be a woman, and although her figure was somewhat distorted now, it was conceivable that before she died she was quite a beauty.</p>
<p>“Why so?” The Corpse Soldier who spoke previously asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>“If I’m not mistaken, part of Brother Nie’s severed arm is missing, right?” The female Corpse Soldier’s eyes flashed.</p>
<p>Hearing what she said, the other two sitting Corpse Soldiers took a second look and discovered that this was indeed the case. The broken arm brought back by the wounded Corpse Soldier was indeed missing a segment, almost as if his arm had been cut twice by some kind of extremely sharp blade.</p>
<p>“Could a Second-Order Saint King really be so powerful? Brother Nie, did you underestimate your opponent?” The female Corpse Soldier said with some meaning of blame.</p>
<p>“It’s not that this Nie underestimated him, it’s just that the power he used was too strange. I’ve never encountered a technique like that before,” The wounded Corpse Soldier recalled that black blade-like attack and even though he was already a corpse, he couldn’t stop himself from shivering slightly. If he hadn’t reacted quickly enough, he would likely have died again. After his last death, he had been brought back by the Corpse Soldiers inside this Corpse Cave and had to cultivate for a hundred years before regaining his sentience; he then spent centuries to achieve his current strength. If he died again, he would forever disappear.</p>
<p>“What kind of power?” The other three Corpse Soldiers felt surprised and quickly asked.</p>

<p>The wounded Corpse Soldier hurriedly talked about his previous encounter with Yang Kai, relaying every detail he could remember without any omission or exaggerations.</p>
<p>After listening, the female Corpse Soldier’s body shuddered slightly as she asked, “You mean, he cut your arm off with a black blade-like attack? And the attack gave off no energy fluctuations but was able to easily slice through your body?”</p>
<p>“En. After getting hit by that strange attack, a part of my arm simply disappeared,” The Corpse Soldier nodded repeatedly, his green eyes staring expectantly at the female Corpse Soldier as he asked, “Do you know anything?”</p>
<p>The female Corpse Soldier pondered and hesitated for a while before answering, “From what you’ve described, it sounds like your opponent was using Space Force.”</p>
<p>“What?” The other three Corpse Soldiers showed looks of shock, “Space Force? Are you serious?”</p>
<p>The female Corpse Soldier coldly snorted, “Did you all forget where I came from originally?”</p>
<p>The wounded Corpse Soldier was startled but quickly remembered and nodded, “I see!”</p>
<p>The female Corpse Soldier nodded lightly and continued, “Among Heaven Battling Union’s Elders, there has always been one who cultivates Space Force. I had the honour of seeing Elder Mo Xiao Sheng display such a Divine Ability once before, so I know more about Space Force than you, but...”</p>
<p>“But what?”</p>
<p>“If what Brother Nie said was accurate, this intruder’s attainments in the Dao of Space are too high. Even Elder Mo was not capable using Space Force to create a blade that could cut through an opponent’s body, so how did a mere Second-Order Saint King achieve this? That is why I said it sounded like he was using Space Force, but I can’t say for certain.”</p>
<p>“Hmm... I’ve also heard much about Mo Xiao Sheng, but all of that was from a few hundred years ago. I don’t even know if he’s still alive for that matter. If that little brat was really able to form a blade from Space Force though, it would be quite terrifying no matter the circumstances.”</p>
<p>“Is there any point in wondering about such things? Did you forget what kind of existences we are now? Sister Lan, I know you have some connection with Elder Mo, but if the current you were to appear in front of him, do you think he’d let you leave alive?”</p>
<p>The female Corpse Solider called Sister Lan heard this and her ghastly green eyes flashed, her mood becoming a bit unstable.</p>
<p>“Right, Brother Nie, when you returned, did properly cover your tracks?” The Corpse Soldier who spoke first asked cautiously.</p>
<p>“Naturally, and even if that person finds this place, he won’t be able to break the barrier protecting it. The defensive Spirit Array around this place was arranged by the Ancient Yang Sect. If we did not know the way to enter and exit it, we would never have been able to break through it. He’s just a trivial Second-Order Saint King, how could he possibly have such skill.”</p>
<p>“Fair enough.” The first Corpse Soldier nodded in agreement, sighing a moment later as if he remembered something, “I really don’t know whether I should be thankful towards the Ancient Yang Sect or if I should hate them. If not for them, I would not have died back then, but without them, perhaps I would have long ago passed on. Now that I have ended up like this, it’s... heh heh!”</p>
<p>Hearing these remarks, the other three Corpse Soldiers remained silent, but obviously, they felt the same way.</p>
<p>After a long silence, the female Corpse Soldier said, “Alright, let’s not think about such things anymore, it’s our four’s turn to guard this place for this decade, so just in case, let’s go take a look so that the Seniors don’t wake up and punish us for acting negligent.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll go and check the situation out with Sister Lan, Brother Nie, you should use the Yin Qi here to quickly connect your severed arm. Although it will not be a perfect match, it is still better than nothing.” Saying so, this Corpse Soldier stood up and walked out with the female Corpse Soldier.</p>
<p>At the same time, inside another huge cave Yang Kai and Yang Yan had just snuck into, they were observing several empty wooden shelves in front of them along with various boxes that had been scattered on the floor. Yang Kai’s expression was horrendous right now and he was having trouble not cursing out loud.</p>
<p>He and Yang Yan had followed a faint medicinal fragrance all the way here and after carefully determining that there were no Corpse Soldiers sleeping inside, had rushed inside.</p>
<p>But how could they have known they would be greeted by such a scene?</p>
<p>This was the place where Ancient Yang Sect had stored its spirit herbs. There were at least several hundred rows of wooden shelves, each one with at least three levels that could hold a minimum of five or six boxes next to each other, but now, all these boxes were scattered about in an unorganized manner.</p>
<p>All of the boxes had been opened and whatever contents they once held were missing.</p>
<p>It was exceedingly difficult to find this place, and just when he was looking forward to reaping a huge harvest, this travesty had appeared in front of him; it could be imagined what Yang Kai’s current mood was.</p>
<p>There was no need to guess, these spirit grasses and spirit medicines must have been eaten by the Corpse Soldiers sleeping here.</p>
<p>Although consuming these spirit herbs like this was a great waste of their medicinal efficacies, it was impossible for Corpse Soldiers to perform Alchemy, so this was really the only option. In a sense, a Corpse Soldier’s cultivation method was similar to that of a Monster Beast.</p>
<p>However, after a careful search, Yang Kai still found the remains of some Fire Attribute and Yang Attribute spirit herbs. Such herbs were akin to poison to Corpse Soldiers who thrived on cold Yin Qi so naturally they had not swallowed them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all the boxes had been opened, and after so long, these spirit herbs had completely withered and became useless. This made Yang Kai furious and he even had the impulse to rush out and chop up all the Corpse Soldiers to bits to relieve his anger.</p>
<p>After a long, unfruitful search, Yang Kai and Yang Yan both sighed.</p>
<p>The spirit herb storage of a great Sect going completely to waste was enough to make anyone who saw it feel distressed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in addition to this place, this Secret Cave had deeper levels, so the pair didn’t hesitate to continue exploring.</p>
<p>Shortly after the two left, the female Corpse Soldier and her companion stealthily appeared. Both Corpse Soldiers sniffed the air lightly before exchanging a surprised glance.</p>
<p>“It’s the aura of a living person!” The male Corpse Soldier whispered.</p>
<p>The female Corpse Soldier nodded in agreement, “Two of them at that. It seems the people Brother Nie met really managed to intrude.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, they must be headed for the ore and artifact storage, that place is where the Seniors are storing a vital material for their future plans!” The male Corpse Soldier glanced at the direction where Yang Kai and Yang Yan disappeared and whispered nervously.</p>
<p>The female Corpse Soldier’s eyes flashed and said, “Let’s follow them for now. If you and I can solve this ourselves, we should avoid alarming the Seniors, otherwise, once they learn we allowed intruders to get this far, we’ll be punished.”</p>
<p>Hearing her say so, the male Corpse Soldier shivered slightly, seemingly quite frightened. In the next moment, he nodded in agreement, “Okay!”</p>
<p>The two Corpse Soldiers circulated their strength to conceal their auras and quietly followed their prey.</p>
<p>Deeper inside the Secret Cave, Yang Kai and Yang Yan walked between another set of wooden shelves. As they waved their hands, various thick and thin ancient books on these shelves disappeared.</p>
<p>This was the storage place for Ancient Yang Sect’s Secret Arts, cultivation techniques, and Martial Skills.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not have time right now to examine these ancient books closely and simply decided to collect all of them first.</p>
<p>However, from the titles of some of these ancient books, Yang Kai saw that there were a large amount related to Corpse Refinement, allowing him to understand why there were so many Corpse Soldiers here. The Ancient Yang Sect was a great Sect not inferior to Heaven Battling Union or Thunder Typhoon Sect, so it was normal that they had such secret books. Presumably, some Ancient Yang Sect disciples or Elders had cultivated these techniques which had allowed so many Corpse Soldiers to appear here two thousand years later.</p>
<p>There were many secret books and Secret Arts in this storage area, but they were still quickly collected by Yang Kai and Yang Yan.</p>
<p>After making sure they had not missed anything, the two of them continued deeper into the Secret Cave.</p>
<p>After a while, the two entered another Secret Cave and were greeted by a dazzling array of artifacts. Even with his rich net worth, Yang Kai could help but feel excited seeing this kind of wealth.</p>
<p>There were thousands of artifacts of all shapes and sized stored here. Weapons represented about ten percent of the total while the rest were discs, beads, various types of jewellery, flags, and other assorted designs. There were also many sets of Artifact Armour.</p>
<p>On the floor of this Secret Cave, there was a massive Spirit Array that seemed to be gathering the surrounding World Energy to maintain these artifacts.</p>
<p>The effects of this Spirit Array were quite good. Although more than two thousand years have passed, most of the artifacts stored here were still shimmering, so it was obvious that they had not lost their spirituality. Most were not at their peak, but they had been preserved well so as long as they were repaired slightly, there would be no issue using them.</p>
<p>Most of the artifacts here were Saint King Grade, with about twenty percent being Origin Grade.</p>
<p>The number of artifacts had Yang Kai in awe.</p>
<p>Exchanging a glance with Yang Yan, the two separated and began collecting with no trace of politeness.</p>
<p>In less than half an incense stick worth of time, this massive storage became empty.</p>
<p>“There’s still another Secret Cave.” After Yang Kai received these artifacts, his eyes drifted towards another passageway, a look of pleasant surprise filling his face.</p>
<p>He and Yang Yan had already passed through the Ancient Yang Sect’s herb storage, secret book archive, and artifact armoury, so what was left was a mystery, but obviously whatever lay beyond this passageway would not be of low value.</p>
<p>Not hesitating in the slightest, Yang Kai and Yang Yan continued deeper.</p>
<p>The two Corpse Soldiers who had been following them waited until they left before quietly appearing while glancing towards the direction they departed with gloomy eyes.</p>
<p>“What should we do? They’ve already entered that place. Even the Seniors can’t enter that place!” The male Corpse Soldier asked.</p>
<p>“What else can we do?” The female Corpse Soldier sighed, “Since the Seniors can’t enter there, naturally we can’t either. We can only wait here for now. The Ancient Yang Sect’s most precious treasure, the Sun’s True Essence, which is housed inside that room has a strong suppressive effect on us, otherwise, the Seniors wouldn’t be helpless to enter that place.”</p>
<p>“En, I’ve heard about that Sun’s True Essence. It is said that it is refined from the core of a Sun-Star. I really wonder what kind of master possessed such Heaven defying means to refine such a thing and how it then fell into the hands of the Ancient Yang Sect.”</p>

<p>Chapter 1297, Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade Pedestal</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>“There’s no need for us to think about such matters. Moreover, although they’ve entered that place, with their cultivations, there’s no way they can take the Sun’s True Essence out with them, so we don’t need to worry,” The female Corpse Soldier sneered.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” The male Corpse Soldier also chuckled, “That Sun’s True Essence is not something that can be handled easily, perhaps those two will suffer a big loss and fall without us even needing to do any work. We should just sit back and watch the show.”</p>
<p>Thinking so, the two Corpse Soldiers relaxed and, after concealing their auras, quietly crept forward while waiting to see what would happen next.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inside the cave, Yang Kai looked at the scene in front of him and almost couldn’t help laughing.</p>
<p>This place was actually a storehouse for Saint Crystals and various rare ores!</p>
<p>High-Rank Saint Crystals were piled up in several hills, each one several metres in height. Even a single one of these hills had at least three or four million Saint Crystal in it.</p>
<p>In other words, there were tens of millions of Saint Crystal stored here!</p>
<p>Yang Kai had been secretly praying that this trip would be able to solve the poverty-stricken situation of Dragon Cave Mountain, but now that wish had actually come true.</p>
<p>He and Yang Yan looked at each other and both saw the deep surprise in each other’s eyes.</p>
<p>Not rushing out to collect these hills of Saint Crystals, the two of them instead turned their attention to a certain jade pillar. This jade pillar was a pure snow-white colour and was exuding a profound chill that made this entire Secret Cave quite cold. It was clear at a glance that this jade pillar was an extraordinary treasure.</p>
<p>On top of this jade pillar were four Space Rings and a strange ore that was surrounded by a thin energy barrier.</p>
<p>Walking up to this jade pillar and examining it carefully, Yang Yan whispered in a solemn manner, “This is... It is! It really is a Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade!”</p>
<p>“Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade!” Yang Kai’s eyes bulged as he anxiously asked, “Are you certain?”</p>
<p>“This is no doubt about it. It’s a Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade, I wouldn’t mistake it for something else.” Seeing her confident expression, Yang Kai was naturally convinced, but for a time his eyes still flashed with surprise and astonishment.</p>
<p>Ice Jade was rare treasure, and Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade was extremely rare even among Ice Jade. If an Ice Attribute cultivation used Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade to refine a personal artifact, it would allow them to more efficiently transform World Energy and increase their cultivation efficiency.</p>
<p>But Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade’s uses didn’t end there. If an Ice Attribute artifact had some Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade added to it, it could increase its power by at least thirty percent and could even allow such an artifact to release a frigid aura that could freeze an opponent’s body and Soul. It was a supreme Ice Attribute treasure.</p>
<p>Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade was known as one of the Three Great Profound Jades, and a fist-sized piece of it would sell for a fortune.</p>
<p>With such a big piece of Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade in front of him, how could Yang Kai not be surprised? But what truly shocked him was that this Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade was actually just a pedestal for the four Space Rings and the strange piece of ore placed above it.</p>
<p>The four Space Rings were unremarkable, and were probably just placed atop this pillar randomly, but the strange looking melon-sized ore was definitely a valuable treasure, otherwise it wouldn’t have been protected by its own barrier.</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced at Yang Yan quietly and found that she really was wearing a dignified expression. While observing this piece of ore, she never spoke, as if even she didn’t know what it was, surprising Yang Kai greatly.</p>
<p>“Let’s take a look at these four Space Rings first,” Yang Kai waited for a long time but still didn’t see any reaction from Yang Yan so he made such a proposal and reached out to pick up the rings.</p>
<p>After sweeping the contest with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai gently nodded.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, these four Space Rings were half filled with Saint Crystals and half filled with rare ores. Needless to say, the amount of Saint Crystals was enormous while the ores were actually rarer and more precious than the ones stored outside.</p>
<p>Yang Kai tossed the rings to Yang Yan, who swept them herself and nodded happily, “Great, with these things, I can refine the treasure I’ve been planning to.”</p>
<p>“What treasure?” Yang Kai asked curiously, wondering just what kind of treasure Yang Yan was so focused on refining.</p>
<p>“It’s a secret for now, but when the time comes I may need to borrow your strength,” Yang Yan grinned and returned the Space Rings.</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced at her but didn’t ask anymore. After putting away the rings, he turned his attention back to the jade pillar’s barrier and asked, “Can you open this?”</p>
<p>“I can!” Yang Yan gently nodded, “But are you sure you want to open it? I don’t know why, but I feel a dangerous aura coming from this thing.”</p>
<p>“You also feel it?” Yang Kai was surprised. He had thought it was just an illusion, but now Yang Yan’s intuition was telling her the same thing as his. Immediately, Yang Kai’s expression became solemn, anything that could make him feel a sense of unease just sitting in front of him was no doubt very dangerous, but at the same time it was obviously incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>Yang Yan didn’t speak as she continued staring at the melon-sized stone in front of them intently, only after some time nodding, “Let’s open it. I believe that even if it is dangerous, we should be able to defend ourselves. If we were to just give up after coming this far, it would be too much of a waste.”</p>
<p>Saying so, she took out her array breaking tools and got to work.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai immediately became vigilant and condensed his Saint Qi, preparing to act at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>After thinking for a while, Yang Kai released the Stone Puppet as well and sent it a command with his Divine Sense. The Stone Puppet immediately rushed to the Saint Crystals and other rare ores and began inhaling them.</p>
<p>The structure of the Stone Puppet’s body was truly mysterious. Although the Stone Puppet looked quite small, its stomach seemed to contain infinite space, and in the blink of an eye it had already swallowed half a hill of Saint Crystals.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had asked Yang Yan about this before, and from her learned that the Stone Puppet itself had an innate ability to devour ores and evolve. Most of the ore swallowed would be spit back out, but it would absorb part of them and their essence to enhance itself.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Stone Puppet would take on some of the characteristics of the ore it swallowed after absorbing them.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, among the first ores the Stone Puppet devoured after it was born were Space Spirit Crystals that contained large amounts of Space Force. It was probably because of this that the Stone Puppet’s stomach capacity had increased exponentially, otherwise, even if an average Stone Puppet had the innate ability to devour large quantities of ore, it would not have been so exaggerated.</p>
<p>The Stone Puppet devoured the Saint Crystals and ores extremely quickly so Yang Kai didn’t need to pay any attention to it, instead focusing his attention on Yang Yan’s actions.</p>
<p>The barrier covering the strange ore seemed quite complicated, and even though it was Yang Yan, it was taking her quite some time to crack it. Yang Kai was naturally concerned that something unexpected would happen, so he quietly released his Divine Sense to monitor their surroundings.</p>
<p>After an initial investigation though, he was quite surprised.</p>
<p>Just outside, in the Secret Cave that the two had swept clean a moment before, there were two faint Corpse Qi auras hiding themselves. Although they were concealed quite well, with Yang Kai’s powerful Divine Sense he was still able to detect them.</p>
<p>What comforted Yang Kai was that these two Corpse Soldiers were only equivalent to Third-Order Saint Kings, and they didn’t show any signs of aggression. In fact, these two were just staying in place, motionless.</p>
<p>As long as they didn’t interfere, Yang Kai was disinclined to manage them, so he simply pretended not to notice anything while silently monitoring their movements as Yang Yan continued her work.</p>
<p>For Yang Kai, as long as they could sweep away everything here, this trip would be a success. At that time, he could just take Yang Yan away with him by tearing space, so even if he alarmed the countless Corpse Soldiers here, he could escape with ease.</p>
<p>Before arriving on Shadowed Star, Yang Kai hadn’t dared to bring along another person as he tore space; after all, The Void was an extremely unstable and hostile environment, and accidents were likely to occur when transitioning to and traveling through it. He could cope with these dangers if he was alone, but he couldn’t guarantee he could keep another person safe if he took them with him.</p>
<p>But now, his understanding and comprehension of the Dao of Space had improved dramatically, so taking another person with him across a thousand kilometres wasn’t a problem anymore.</p>
<p>With such confidence, Yang Kai naturally was not afraid of anything.</p>
<p>The barrier that surrounded the strange ore atop the jade pillar remained radiant even as Yang Yan worked on it, but if one looked closely, they would notice that slight ripples were now occurring across its surface. At the same time, the barrier began stretching and contracting, sometimes expanding and sometimes shrinking, making for quite an odd sight.</p>
<p>This time, unlike with all the previous Spirit Arrays she had cracked along the way, Yang Yan’s expression was particularly solemn and a touch of red filled her cheeks, indicating she was somewhat strained.</p>
<p>As time passed, the light barrier began to distort more obviously, and even Yang Kai could tell that it was on the verge of breaking.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Yang Yan muttered seriously, “Be careful.”</p>
<p>As soon as she spoke these words, the barrier broke, and at the same time, a pure Fire Attribute aura that shocked both Yang Kai and Yang Yan greatly burst from the strange ore.</p>
<p>In an instant, the entire Secret Cave became blisteringly hot as the mass of Fire Attribute energy seemed to transform into a Fire Dragon and charged out.</p>
<p>Yang Yan’s face suddenly turned pale. Although she had somewhat anticipated things would quickly become dangerous, she hadn’t expected it would happen the instant the barrier broke. The Fire Dragon hadn’t even reached her yet but she already felt as if she was being melted.</p>
<p>Several defensive artifacts on her body automatically activated just as Yang Yan sensed danger, and several layers of defensive barriers appeared in front of her.</p>
<p>These artifacts were all Origin Grade Low-Rank and were tailor-made for her, so the protection they offered wasn’t worse than an ordinary Origin Grade High-Rank artifact.</p>
<p>However, the Fire Dragon approaching her seemed unstoppable, and the instant its pure Fire Attribute energy impacted the light shields in front of Yang Yan, they all evaporated and with a crisp crack, the two earring she was wearing shattered, along with a bracelet on her wrist while at the same time, the glow from the Artifact Armour she was wearing went dull.</p>
<p>These three layers of protection were unable to stop the approach of the heat wave and had all been burnt through as if they were paper. Some of her prided artifacts were even destroyed in the process.</p>

<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>The moment the three defensive artifacts Yang Yan had tailor made for herself were destroyed, she couldn’t help letting out a panicked scream.</p>
<p>At that moment, a huge hand grasped her shoulder and dragged her back. Simultaneously, a figure moved in front of her wearing a dignified expression. Solemnly, Yang Kai waved his hand and sent out two giant black fireballs to intercept the Fire Dragon.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had already changed the nature of his Demonic Flame from pure hot to pure cold, but the instant these fireballs impacted the Fire Dragon, they were annihilated.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s complexion changed, and while he hurriedly retreated, a crisp cry rang out from his body. In a flash of light, the Firebird Artifact Spirit leapt out and grandly spread its wings, growing to nearly ten metres in width as it sprayed out a fiery red blast of light towards the approaching Fire Dragon. Unfortunately, even this intense attack was unable to halt the advance of the Fire Dragon, causing it not even the slightest of hindrances.</p>
<p>The Fire Dragon seemed like an unstoppable force, and every type of defence Yang Kai put up would be torn through easily.</p>
<p>The Firebird Artifact Spirit’s eyes flashed an almost human-like light as a look of horror filled its face, but immediately after, a violent determination filled its aura as it shrank back down and transformed its entire body into a ray of light that shot out to meet the Fire Dragon.</p>
<p>The dragon roared and the Artifact Spirit cried as the two clashed inside the Secret Cave in a blazing exchange.</p>
<p>After the Artifact Spirit rushed into the Fire Dragon’s body, it finally slowed its advance, but only a moment later, the Artifact Spirit let out a pained cry and fled back out of the Fire Dragon, swiftly disappearing into Yang Kai’s body.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s complexion changed greatly.</p>
<p>He had already refined the Origin King Grade Artifact Refining Furnace so he could naturally sense the state of the Artifact Spirit. This Origin King Grade Artifact Refining Furnace had been heated inside the Earth Lung Fire Pond for tens of thousands of years in order to form the Artifact Spirit, yet it had been severely damaged by the Fire Attribute Energy of this Fire Dragon. How could Yang Kai not be shocked?</p>
<p>The Fire Attribute energy the Artifact Spirit formed from was already extremely rich and pure, so what had this Fire Dragon been born from that it could cause severe trauma to the Artifact Spirit, which was of the same attribute?</p>
<p>However, although the Artifact Spirit was injured, the Fire Dragon seemed to have also been weakened greatly. Its colour had not only dimmed considerably but its size had also been greatly reduced. Even so, with a shake of its head, it once again rushed towards Yang Kai, as if vowing to never give up until it burnt him and Yang Yan to ashes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yang Kai’s expression became calm and a mysterious wave of power pulsed from his body. Reaching out with both his hands, Yang Kai seemingly grabbed the space in front of him and as he grits his teeth hard ripped it apart.</p>
<p>Instantly, a bottomless black hole that seemed capable of swallowing everything in existence appeared, and as Yang Kai continued pulling on it, this Void Tear continued to expand.</p>
<p>As soon as this Void Tear took shape, the Fire Dragon plunged inside it.</p>
<p>Space distorted greatly as the Void Tear became extremely unstable, as if it would collapse at any moment. Yang Kai snorted and, using all the Space Force he could generate, he reinforced this Void Tear so it would not instantly be destroyed.</p>
<p>After three breaths, the Fire Dragon completely vanished into The Void, and at the same time, this Void Tear fractured like the surface of a cracked mirror and broke apart.</p>
<p>Standing in place, Yang Kai gasped for breath while Yang Yan, who he had been shielding, shivered in fright.</p>
<p>But after the disaster had passed, Yang Yan seemed to think of something and as she stared towards the strange stone, her beautiful eyes trembling violently as she covered her mouth and uttered hoarsely, “Sun’s True Essence?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face twitched, as if he had heard something unbelievable while his eyes flashed brilliantly.</p>
<p>What was strange, however, was that after the Fire Dragon was swallowed up by The Void, this thing that Yang Yan called Sun’s True Essence once again became plain and unremarkable. Yang Kai couldn’t even feel any burning power from it, as if it had become an ordinary stone people would flat out ignore if they saw it on the roadside.</p>
<p>However, there was no time to think about such things at the moment. Yang Kai and Yang Yan had snuck into this place secretly, and although they had been followed by two Corpse Soldiers, those two seemed to have no intention of blocking them.</p>
<p>But now, the violent exchange must have woken up the slumbering Corpse Soldiers.</p>
<p>Releasing his Divine Sense, Yang Kai’s face sank as he easily confirmed his guess. The Corpse Soldiers hibernating in the forked caves had mostly woken up, and many different Corpse Qi fluctuations were now rapidly approaching.</p>
<p>At the same time, a dull roar came from further underground. This roar was like that of a fierce beast and contained a potent, angry, malevolent aura. Just this roar alone caused Yang Kai’s Soul to vibrate and his eyes to go bloodshot as violent impulses welled up in his heart.</p>
<p>The Corpse Soldiers who were rushing over heard this low roar and, as if they had received some kind of order, returned a low roar of their own that echoed throughout the entire cave network. Immediately after, these Corpse Soldiers began racing over even faster than before.</p>
<p>In an instant, cries and howls that made one’s skin crawl rang out from all directions.</p>
<p>The Corpse Soldiers that had been secretly following behind Yang Kai and Yang Yan no longer hid themselves and stood openly at the entrance to the Secret Cave, glaring as they bared their cold, gleaming fangs.</p>
<p>Yang Yan saw all this and her heart sank, her face going completely white.</p>
<p>However, these two Corpse Soldiers didn’t seem to have any immediate intention to rush inside. Instead, they were just glaring at Yang Kai and Yang Yan while secretly observing the piece of Sun’s True Essence, their eyes filling with fear each time they glanced at it.</p>
<p>The originally peaceful Sun’s True Essence suddenly began emitting a terrifying fire aura the moment the Corpse Soldiers appeared; however, it didn’t release this Fire Attribute energy in any way, as if so long as the Corpse Soldiers didn’t approach, it wouldn’t act.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai was overjoyed and quickly reached out to grab this piece of Sun’s True Essence. Releasing a massive amount of his Saint Qi, Yang Kai wanted to wrap up the Sun’s True Essence to put it into his Space Ring when Yang Yan hurriedly shouted, “Don’t!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai was stunned, but he immediately realized what was wrong. In the instant that his Divine Sense and Saint Qi contacted the Sun’s True Essence, they were incinerated, causing Yang Kai to stumble backwards several steps as he stared at this melon-sized object in terror.</p>
<p>He wasn’t able to move this Sun’s True Essence into his Space Ring at all.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the two Corpse Soldiers standing at the door unscrupulously showed a grin, the female Corpse Soldier even shouting, “Daring to break into our Corpse Cave and even having ideas about our Sun’s True Essence, just wait for the Seniors to come and see what fate awaits you.”</p>
<p>The male Corpse Soldier also taunted, “Now now, these two will soon become our companions! Sister Lan should speak a little more kindly; after all, we’ll all be family in the future.”</p>
<p>The female Corpse Soldier coldly snorted, “Why do I need to treat them politely? Transforming into Corpse Soldiers and obtaining sentience will take them at least a hundred years, if they’re even successful. If they fail to become one of us, they’ll just turn into our food.”</p>
<p>The male Corpse Soldier pondered a little and nodded, “Fair enough, there really isn’t any need for us to be polite with them.”</p>
<p>These two were openly mocking Yang Kai and Yang Yan, Yang Kai didn’t have any intention to respond to them. Since the other party didn’t dare to enter this place, he didn’t need to waste time killing them. On top of that, the fight just now had already alarmed the entire Corpse Cave and from these two Corpse Soldier’s conversation, it was clear that Corpse General level existences were on their way. The most important thing right now was to find a way to take away this Sun’s True Essence.</p>
<p>Yang Kai couldn’t help turning his eyes to Yang Yan, but seeing that Yang Yan was also in a state of utter frustration, he couldn’t help feeling his heart sink.</p>
<p>Yang Yan naturally knew a method of taking away this Sun’s True Essence, but it would require quite a bit of time and effort to implement. Wanting to use a Space Ring to carry this treasure was impossible, but as Yang Yan was trying to find another option, the same deep roar which had emanated from down below once again resounded and a terrifying coercion and pressure enveloped the Secret Cave.</p>
<p>“Third-Order Origin Returning Realm!” Yang Kai felt the force of this pressure and his face changed dramatically.</p>
<p>The situation here was quite different from what he and Yang Yan had expected. Previously, he and Yang Yan estimated that even if a Corpse General was present, it would at most be two thousand years old. Based on the difficulty of using Corpse Qi to cultivate, over two millennia, it would already be quite impressive if a weak Second-Order Origin Realm Corpse General had emerged.</p>
<p>So now that Corpse General equivalent to a peak Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master, only one step away from becoming a Corpse King, had appeared, how could Yang Kai not be shocked?</p>
<p>Thinking about it for a moment though, Yang Kai realized that the existence of this Corpse Cave had likely accelerated the cultivation of this Corpse General.</p>
<p>Even if Yang Kai used all of his means, it would be impossible for him to oppose such a powerful opponent, much less protect Yang Yan in the process.</p>
<p>[Was the only option to immediately flee?] Yang Kai looked at Sun’s True Essence and his face filled with unwillingness!</p>
<p>This was one of the most valuable treasures he had ever seen, and to him, it was even more important than the Nine Branch Jade Crystal Tree, second only to his Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus.</p>
<p>Because he still had a number of drops of Profound Yin Sunflower Water, if Yang Kai was able to obtain this Sun’s True Essence and draw out the astonishing Fire Attribute Energy inside it, he could continue refining the Profound Yin Sunflower Water. The benefits of this were difficult to even estimate.</p>
<p>After refining Profound Yin Sunflower Water in the Earth Lung Fire Pond last time, Yang Kai discovered that doing so not only enhanced his physical strength and cultivation, but also the power of his Demonic Flame.</p>
<p>Right now, he could only pin his hopes on Yang Yan. If even Yang Yan couldn’t think of a solution, he could only withdraw temporarily.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was confident that even if this Corpse General possessed astonishing strength, it had no way to take away or use this Sun’s True Essence, otherwise, it wouldn’t have been left idle here for so many years.</p>

<p>As Yang Yan continued to wear a strained expression, seemingly unable to find a solution to this problem, the source of the malevolent pressure rapidly closed in. Soon, the approaching enemy closed to within a couple of kilometres and Yang Kai could now even hear its hurried footfalls.</p>
<p>Yang Kai sighed as he realized it would be too late if he didn’t immediately leave. Although ordinary Corpse Soldiers wouldn’t dare to get close with the Sun’s True Essence here, there was no way to know if this Corpse General that had cultivated for two thousand years would be subject to the same restrictions. If he and Yang Yan continued to linger, they would only be putting themselves in grave danger.</p>
<p>But before Yang Kai could speak up to suggest they withdraw, Yang Yan’s eyes suddenly brightened as if she just remembered something and hurriedly called out, “Xiao Xiao!”</p>
<p>Hearing her call, the Stone Puppet which had been devouring the piles of Saint Crystals and ores rushed over without hesitation. At this moment, of the dozen or so hill like piles of ores, the Stone Puppet had swallowed more than half.</p>
<p>After the Stone Puppet arrived, Yang Yan pointed at the Sun’s True Essence in front of them and asked softly, “Can you swallow it?”</p>
<p>The Stone Puppet’s seemingly always indifferent face showed a hint of hesitation and fear as its eyes flashed a dignified light.</p>
<p>The Stone Puppet had an innate ability to devour all kinds of ore and absorb their essence. Even Space Spirit Crystals could be swallowed effortlessly, but in front of this melon-sized Sun’s True Essence, the Stone Puppet hesitated.</p>
<p>Obviously, even for it, this thing was extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Yan showed a look of helplessness and didn’t try to force it. After all, for Yang Yan, although the Sun’s True Essence was truly invaluable, the Stone Puppet was equally irreplaceable. This little thing had repeatedly cooperated with Yang Yan to temper Artifact Refining materials, and she had already developed a deep affection for it. It was impossible for her to treat it like a simple tool now.</p>
<p>However, to Yang Yan’s surprise, after hesitating for an instant, the Stone Puppet suddenly let out a great roar and its body shone brightly as a series of mysterious glowing ruins flowed across its rocky Battle Armour.</p>
<p>The Stone Puppet’s aura underwent a rapid and dramatic change, suddenly giving off an incredibly sturdy feeling, as if nothing in this world could harm it.</p>
<p>Both Yang Kai and Yang Yan were dumbfounded, neither of them having expected the Stone Puppet to possess such an ability.</p>
<p>The mysterious runes only appeared for a moment before sinking into the Stone Puppet’s body. At the same time, its Battle-Armour-like skin now shimmered brilliantly and looked extremely powerful.</p>
<p>A crackling sound came from all the joints of the Stone Puppet, and under the stunned gazes of Yang Kai and Yang Yan, its tiny body grew to ten metres in height.</p>
<p>In a few giant steps, the Stone Puppet arrived in front of the Sun’s True Essence and stretched out its big hand, grabbing the rock with a dignified expression.</p>
<p>A terrifying ray of fire leapt out from inside the Sun’s True Essence and transformed into a fire snake that struck towards the Stone Puppet’s approaching hand. The Stone Puppet flashed a strange grin and used its giant hand to grasp this fire snake and seemingly easily crush it, scattering a dazzling light in all directions.</p>
<p>Even so, Yang Kai noticed that the Stone Puppet’s big hand had slightly melted, shocking him greatly.</p>
<p>Without the hindrance of the fire snake, the Stone Puppet directly grabbed the melon-sized Sun’s True Essence, opened its mouth wide, and swallowed it. In the next moment, a dull roar burst from Stone Puppet’s throat, as if it was suffering from unimaginable torture, and the surface of its body glowed a bright red light. The runes surfaced on its mighty Battle Armour again and rapidly began bursting, changing into a mysterious kind of strength that poured back into its body and suppressed the terrifying heat.</p>
<p>Completing all this, the Stone Puppet’s body shrank down again, and in a flash, it returned to its original look.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Yang Kai took the Stone Puppet into his Black Book Space.</p>
<p>He had previously experienced the horrifying power of the Sun’s True Essence so he hadn’t dared to put it into his Black Book Space at will, but now that the Stone Puppet had swallowed it, this was the natural choice.</p>
<p>What happened here was not missed by the two Corpse Soldiers standing at the door who had been constantly observing Yang Kai and Yang Yan.</p>
<p>Seeing this pair that had invaded the Corpse Cave actually possessed a method to take away the Sun’s True Essence, these two Corpse Soldiers could no longer stand idly by, so with a great roar, they charged into the Secret Cave.</p>
<p>The female Corpse Soldier’s fingernails released a dark glow as they extended and her hair shot out like snakes to grab Yang Kai.</p>
<p>At the same time, the male Corpse Soldier inhaled deeply before spewing out a cloud of Corpse Qi that flew over to engulf Yang Kai and Yang Yan.</p>
<p>Yang Kai just coldly snorted and with a flick of his wrist, a golden thread flew out towards the female Corpse Soldier while he simultaneously waved his other hand to release a black blade-like attack towards the male Corpse Soldier.</p>
<p>“A Space Force blade!” The male Corpse Soldier had already learned about some of Yang Kai’s methods from his companion, so the moment he saw this black blade which emitted no discernible aura, he was naturally terrified and frantically dodged. The female Corpse Soldier wasn’t as lucky and was directly penetrated by Yang Kai’s Golden Blood Thread which instantly restrained her in place.</p>
<p>With a single thought, Yang Kai transformed this single Golden Blood Thread into a golden net which quickly wrapped up the female Corpse Soldier in a blinding golden radiance.</p>
<p>“Impossible!” The female Corpse Soldier screamed out in shock, as if she had just witnessed something impossible. After the golden light faded, this female Corpse Soldier’s body had actually be cut into hundreds of pieces and scattered about across the floor.</p>
<p>After the male Corpse Soldier witnessed how his companion, who was equal in strength to him, was instantly killed by the other party, a terrified light flashed across his ghastly green eyes. He didn’t dare confront Yang Kai any longer and hastily fled towards the exit to this Secret Cave.</p>
<p>At that moment though, a tall and majestic figure wearing a blood red robe suddenly appeared in the entrance to the Secret Cave. Although this figure was still a bit thin, he resembled a living person quite closely. With a relatively normal looking face and the typical black and white eye colour, were it not for the intense Corpse Qi coming from him, this man could likely have passed for an ordinary cultivator.</p>
<p>As soon as he appeared, he eyes landed on Yang Kai who was currently taking away the Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade Pedestal. Noticing its escaping subordinate, this figure waved its fist towards him and the male Corpse Soldier who had just barely managed to escape Yang Kai Space Blade burst apart and was smashed into dust.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes shrank as he witnessed this scene and shouted, “Corpse General!”</p>
<p>This figure was obviously the powerful Corpse General Yang Kai had sensed approaching, but the moment it appeared, it had instantly killed one of its subordinates, so it was clear to see it was quite enraged.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Corpse General saw the Ice Jade Pedestal disappear and was unable to sense any trace of the Sun’s True Essence, so how could he not know what had happened?</p>
<p>Immediately, a low roar burst from his mouth.</p>
<p>Yang Kai trembled involuntarily and he suddenly felt as if he was being torn in two. At the same time, his Knowledge Sea tumbled violently, like it was on the verge of boiling over.</p>
<p>Yang Yan was in even worse shape. A halo of light appeared around her but shattered instantly, after which her small face went white and she coughed up a mouthful of blood. Obviously she had received a serious injury.</p>
<p>“Return what you stole!” The Corpse General snorted and took a big step towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>With no time to hesitate, Yang Kai flung out a dozen Space Blades and at the same time ripped open a Void Tear. Taking advantage of the Corpse General’s surprise, Yang Kai grabbed Yang Yan and rushed directly into The Void.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until that moment that the approaching Corpse General seemed to realize that something was wrong, and with a terrifying roar, he shot out a giant yellow Corpse Qi hand towards the Void Tear.</p>
<p>However, he was too late. By the time his Corpse Qi hand reached the tear, Yang Kai and Yang Yan’s figures had completely disappeared, and although this attack managed to affect the stability of this Void Tear, it still couldn’t stop them from escaping.</p>
<p>[Space Force!] The Corpse General was stunned, but in the next moment became furious, sending out an enrage howl as his face filled with unwillingness.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the other party having cultivated Space Force, how could he have allowed them to escape with such a massive gap in their strength? As long as he was given three breaths, he was confident he could grind these two intruders into patties and retrieve what they had stolen.</p>
<p>Shortly after, other figures appeared in Secret Cave, all of them looking around the now half empty room somberly. Each of these figures exuded an aura not inferior to the first Corpse General who had arrived here. They were all peak Origin Returning Realm masters, four of them in total.</p>
<p>Other Corpse Generals who were equal to Second-Order Origin Returning Realm masters also soon arrived, making the entire Secret Cave quite a bustling scene.</p>
<p>“Where’s the Sun’s True Essence?” One of the Corpse Generals dressed in azure robes glanced at the spot where the jade pedestal originally stood and asked.</p>
<p>“It was taken away,” The first red-clothed Corpse General who rushed here replied angrily.</p>
<p>“What? The Sun’s True Essence was taken away?” The other two peak-level Corpse Generals shouted in disbelief, “Was the person who came a peak Origin Returning Realm master? But just a moment ago I only detected a Second-Order Saint King.”</p>
<p>“It really was just a Second-Order Saint King. As for how he took away the Sun’s True Essence, I don’t know,” The red robed Corpse General replied.</p>
<p>“You couldn’t stop a trivial Second-Order Saint King? Junior Brother Long, did you rot after sleeping for so long?” The azure robed Corpse General looked at the former with a sneer.</p>
<p>The red robed Corpse General simply glanced over at this man and replied indifferently, “The other party cultivated the Dao of Space, and it seems his attainments in it are extremely high, allowing him to directly tear space and flee. Does Senior Brother Mo think he could have stopped him if he were here?”</p>
<p>“The Dao of Space?”</p>
<p>“Tore space?”</p>
<p>“Impossible!”</p>
<p>The other three Corpse Generals exclaimed, their eyes overflowing with shock.</p>
<p>“There are still some residual distortions in the space here. Whether I am telling the truth or not, you should be able to tell for yourselves.” The red robed Corpse General didn’t seem to want to explain any further and simply stopped talking.</p>
<p>The other Corpse Generals heard this and all released their Divine Senses to investigate. After a while, their expressions turning ugly. They were indeed able to sense a slight Space Force fluctuation, so it was obvious the red-robed Corpse General wasn’t lying.</p>
<h2>1300</h2>
<p>Chapter 1300, Underworld Well Spring</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>The Secret Cave was quiet for a while as the four Corpse Generals whose strength was comparable to peak Origin Returning Realm masters did not know what to say. They did not immediately pursue Yang Kai; after all, this thief was capable of tearing space. Even if they possessed great strength, they might not be able to catch him. Only if they possessed a similar method to instantly cross great distances would they have a chance.</p>
<p>“The Sun’s True Essence was the key to our promotion to Corpse Kings, but now that it has been taken away, what are we supposed to do?” A white-robed Corpse General frowned and asked in annoyance.</p>
<p>“En, without the Sun’s True Essence, how are we supposed to continue our Corpse Refinement Art and reach the Corpse King stage, achieving immortal and indestructible bodies?” The final black-robed Corpse General asked, a fierce light flashing across his eyes, seemingly unwilling to just let Yang Kai escape.</p>
<p>“Indeed, even if he is proficient in Space Force, we can’t just let him go. I’ll go now and capture him,” The azure-robed Corpse General clenched his teeth, stomped his feet, and turned around, as if he really intended to pursue Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother Mo, could it be you’ve forgotten about Star Emperor Mountain? Although two thousand years have passed, if we leave this place at this time, it will draw those monsters’ attention. Furthermore, since that person is proficient in Space Force, will we even be able to catch up to him now?” The white-robed Corpse General quickly stopped him.</p>
<p>Hearing the name Star Emperor Mountain, the other three Corpse Generals couldn’t help narrowing their eyes, a mixture of fear and hatred flashing across their faces. The azure-robed Corpse General also stopped in place.</p>
<p>The white-robed Corpse General suddenly chuckled at that moment, “Although the Sun’s True Essence has been lost, that might not necessarily be a bad thing.”</p>
<p>“What?” The azure-robed Corpse General looked at him in amazement.</p>
<p>“Do Senior Brothers know why our Ancient Yang Sect put this piece of Sun’s True Essence here?” The white-robed Corpse General smiled meaningfully and asked.</p>
<p>“Does Junior Brother Kang know?”</p>
<p>The white-robed Corpse General didn’t explain right away but instead glanced over at the location where the Ice Jade Pedestal had stood and said, “I was never quite certain about this matter, but now I am at least eighty percent sure. Senior Brothers should take a look over there to see if they can feel anything.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, the other three Corpse Generals exchanged a glance before releasing their Divine Senses to carefully investigate.</p>
<p>A moment later, the three Corpse Generals all wore shocked looks, the azure-robed Corpse General even exclaiming, “Such rich Yin Qi! It looks like it has been sealed off somehow and is now only slightly revealing itself, but even so, the Corpse Qi here is far denser than anywhere else in the Corpse Cave.”</p>
<p>The red-robed and black-robed Corpse Generals did not speak but showed equally surprised expressions on their faces. Obviously, this rich Yin Qi was extremely important to them.</p>
<p>The three Corpse Generals quickly turned their attention back to the white-robed Corpse General, the azure-robed one asking, “Junior Brother Kang, you are the only direct descendant of our Honoured Master, do you know something? If so, don’t keep your Senior Brothers in suspense.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. Junior Brother Kang, although the three of us are older than you, how could we compare with your understanding of the Sect’s secrets? When the Sect was destroyed, all of us were mere Saint Realm cultivators. If not for Junior Brother bringing us here to hide, I’m afraid we would have long ago perished.”</p>
<p>Even the red-robed Corpse General, who seemed to be the most recalcitrant, turned to the white-robed Corpse General with a softened look, showing an expectant expression.</p>
<p>The white-robed Corpse General just chuckled lightly, “The matters of the past should be left in the past, the several Senior Brothers don’t need to care about them so much. The reason why I brought all of you here was because it was the Sect Master’s orders, a last-ditch attempt to preserve some of the Ancient Yang Sect’s heritage.”</p>
<p>When these words came out, the expressions of the four Corpse Generals all dimmed.</p>
<p>Although they had indeed managed to preserve the last remnants of the Ancient Yang Sect, the four handsome and heroic Sect Brothers had degenerated into such a state, so they couldn’t help questioning if they had actually fulfilled the hopes of their Sect Master.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, the white-robed Corpse General composed himself and continued, “At that time, my strength wasn’t very high, and although my father was the Sect Master, I was not qualified to know many of the Sect’s core secrets. However, I once heard my father and mother talking about this Secret Cave, and at that time, they said that there was an Underworld Well Spring sealed here. “</p>
<p>“An Underworld Well Spring!” The three Corpse General heard this and could not help calling out in alarm.</p>
<p>“Indeed!” The white-robed Corpse General nodded solemnly, “In the past, we obviously wouldn’t have known what an Underworld Well Spring was, but I assume Senior Brothers all understand now, right?”</p>
<p>“Naturally!” The azure-robed Corpse General nodded with a dignified expression, “Underworld Well Springs are rumoured to be entrances to the underworld and are the most coveted Holy Lands for existences like us.”</p>
<p>“No wonder, no wonder a Corpse Cave formed here, it turns out there was actually an Underworld Well Spring!” The black-robed Corpse General murmured thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“In order to seal this Underworld Well Spring, one of our Ancient Yang Sect’s former Sect Masters somehow obtained a piece of Sun’s True Essence and used its scorching Sun’s True Fire to suppress it. This method on its own could be considered quite good, but in order to store the Sun’s True Essence absolutely safely, some later generation’s Sect Master spent a huge price to refine that Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade Pedestal and placed it here! It could be said that this matter is one of the Sect’s biggest secrets that only the Sect Master and a few select Elders were eligible to know.” After the white-robed Corpse General finished, he smiled and said, “Although I heard a few words about this many years ago, I didn’t understand much about them. On top of that, with the Sun’s True Essence sealing this place, we were unable to even get close to it, so I never bothered telling Senior Brothers. I hope Senior Brothers won’t blame me!”</p>
<p>“Hahaha!” The azure-robed Corpse General laughed heartily before patting the white-robed Corpse General’s shoulder heavily, “How could Junior Brother ask such a thing? We four brothers are already family, how could we blame you? Not to mention, even if you had told us about this matter, there wouldn’t have been anything we could have done about it. En, but now it seems there really is an Underworld Well Spring here!”</p>
<p>“Indeed, just the Yin Qi which is leaking from the seal is already so strong, so if we were to completely open it, wouldn’t we be able to obtain endless benefits? With the help of this Underworld Well Spring, it should not be impossible for us to reach the Corpse King level, and this method is far safer than the Corpse Refinement Art we were originally planning to use.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. None of us have attempted to cultivate the last part of the Corpse Refinement Art, but having to rely on an item as dangerous as that Sun’s True Essence is really quite daunting. Originally, I didn’t approve of us continuing to try to advance our cultivation, but now, all our problems are solved. It seems we should be thanking that kid who took away the Sun’s True Essence.”</p>
<p>The red-robed Corpse General, who had been silent for a long, suddenly said thoughtfully, “I always wondered why the Sect practiced Corpse Refinement and why Elder Liu possessed several extremely powerful Corpse Puppets, but now it makes sense. It seems it was all because of this place.”</p>
<p>The several Corpse Generals pondered for a moment before nodding in agreement.</p>
<p>The azure-robed Corpse General soon waved his hand, “Good, now that we know there is an Underworld Well Spring here, our first priority should be to find a way to break its seal. Presumably, without the Sun’s True Essence suppression, with our current strength, it should not be difficult to break this thing. Before we begin though, we need to make we are not disturbed by outsiders again, otherwise, if someone becomes aware of our Sect’s survival, word may reach Star Emperor Mountain’s ears.”</p>
<p>“That’s easy enough to solve, just let them go clean up the area. In any case, the outside world’s powerhouses don’t know anything about the situation here, as long as we don’t act too overtly there shouldn’t be any big problems,” The red-robed Corpse General sneered before turning his head to look at the large number of Corpse Soldiers and Corpse Generals that had at some point arrived here and were standing around in a dense formation. Each of these Corpse Soldiers and Corpse Generals had a rich malevolent aura and their green eyes, though eerie, were still filled with a sharp light, clearly indicating that they possessed a substantial level of sentience.</p>
<p>Several top-ranking Corpse Generals immediately issued a series of orders, after which the Corpse Soldiers and Corpse Generals began flooding out of the Corpse Cave in groups of three to five, all of them headed to clean up various important locations inside Grand Burial Valley.</p>
<p>While the four Corpse Generals were talking, however, a thousand kilometres away, a black crack in space appeared. This rough and crooked crack was clearly quite unstable. A moment later, a figure emerged from it, quickly followed by another.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time the second figure emerged, the Void Tear suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>Yang Kai turned his head back to the closed Void Tear with a look of lingering fear.</p>
<p>Although he was able to successfully bring Yang Yan and flee a thousand kilometres away by tearing space at the last moment, the attack of the Corpse General in red still affected the stability of the Void Tear, nearly causing him and Yang Yan to become forever lost in The Void. If it were not for his comprehension of the Dao of Space having improved dramatically in recent years, even if he had been able to escape, Yang Yan would certainly have died.</p>
<p>Yang Yan was unaware of the danger she had just been in, but Yang Kai had a cold sweat dripping down his back as he secretly decided that the next time he wanted to bring someone else along with him using this method, he had to first reach a position where the enemy wouldn’t be able to interfere, otherwise the risk would be far too great.</p>
<p>Additionally, Yang Kai was not sure if it was his imagination or not, but before leaving the Corpse Cave, he felt an unusual aura coming from the place where the Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade Pedestal had stood.</p>
<p>Shaking his head, Yang Kai did not think too deeply about it. Escaping from a peak level Origin Returning Realm master was fortunate enough, and this trip had also resulted in a huge harvest.</p>
<p>There was not enough time to take inventory of his gains here though, so Yang Kai just checked on the Stone Puppet’s situation inside the Black Book Space for now. After confirming that it would be fine in the short term, Yang Kai wrapped Yang Yan in his Saint Qi, confirmed his bearings, and began heading for the outskirts of the Grand Burial Valley.</p>
<p>Yang Yan seemed to still be quite frightened by what had happened in the Corpse Cave, so along the way she did not say anything, just shivering slightly as she clung tightly to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>It was expected as she was naturally timid.</p>
<p>There was no danger along the way, only a few Yin Souls who were disturbed by the movement of Yang Kai’s Saint Qi; however, because Yang Kai was quite eager to leave and was travelling at great speed, no Yin Soul was able to pursue them for long and before he knew it, the two of them had already crossed half the distance to the valley’s exit.</p>

<p>Chapter 1301, Meeting Chen Shi Tao Again</p>

<p>When they entered the Grand Burial Valley, because they were searching around and exploring, Yang Kai and Yang Yan hadn’t moved very fast and could only travel on foot, but now that they were simply trying to leave, Yang Kai had directly summoned his Star Shuttle, so naturally, they were travelling much faster.</p>
<p>Just as Yang Kai was hurrying along with Yang Yan though, he suddenly came to an abrupt halt and turned his head in a certain direction, letting out a slight expression of surprise.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Yang Yan asked curiously, wondering why Yang Kai had suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing,” Yang Kai replied faintly, “I just sensed someone from that group we met before, but her condition seems to be a bit off.”</p>
<p>By some kind of coincidence, there was a figure who was rushing towards Yang Kai and Yang Yan’s position hurriedly, and under the pair’s observation, they quickly discovered that it was the young woman named Lu Ying who had been together with Chen Shi Tao.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, she looked quite panicked and her Saint Qi was fluctuating unstably.</p>
<p>Another strange point was that Lu Ying was by herself; Chen Shi Tao of Clear Sky Sect, and Chen Fan Lei and Wang Yu Han of Extreme Path Sect were all nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>The other party had obviously encountered some kind of trouble. If it had been a stranger, Yang Kai would have immediately left; after all, he had just provoked all of the powerful monsters in the Corpse Cave not long ago, so how could he stupidly remain here?</p>
<p>But the one who was approaching in a state of distress was someone he knew, so Yang Kai could not just pretend like he never saw her. If he were to leave just like this, it would leave a bitter after taste.</p>
<p>On top of that, it was thanks to Chen Shi Tao that he had learned that this was Grand Burial Valley, so however minor it was, he owed her a favour.</p>
<p>After pondering for a moment, Yang Kai grit his teeth and flew his Star Shuttle down to meet Lu Ying.</p>
<p>Lu Ying was sweeping her eyes over her surrounding as she was fleeing, seemingly looking for something so when she suddenly noticed someone approaching, she could not help feeling a bit startled. However, glancing over and noticing that it was Yang Kai, she showed a joyful expression and the vigilance and panic on her face disappeared and she raced over to meet them.</p>
<p>Before she even got close, she shouted, “Senior Brother Yang!”</p>
<p>“Sister Lu Ying!” Yang Kai returned the greeting as he came to a stop in front of her before asking curiously, “Why are you so flustered?”</p>
<p>“Senior Brother Yang, please help me rescue Senior Sister Chen! She is currently being attacked by a Ninth-Order Monster Beast.”</p>
<p>“A Ninth-Order Monster Beast?” Yang Kai’s face sank, “How could there be Monster Beasts here? And a Ninth-Order one at that.”</p>
<p>Ninth-Order Monster Beasts were equivalent to Human Race Origin Returning Realm masters, but in this strange Grand Burial Valley, such a Monster Beast existing was quite unexpected.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but it was indeed a Ninth-Order Monster Beast. Senior Sister Chen and the others were trapped by it, but they found a way for me to escape so I could look for help. Senior Brother Yang, I beg you, please come with me before it’s too late.”</p>
<p>“Sister Lu Ying must be joking,” Yang Kai didn’t immediately agree, putting on a frown as he said, “I am just a Second-Order Saint King, even lower than Sister Chen and Brother Wang. If even they were trapped by that Monster Beast, if I come with you, wouldn’t I just be seeking death?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Lu Ying’s expression went blank as she did not know how to respond.</p>
<p>Just now, she had been incredibly anxious to find help, but with so few people in this Grand Burial Valley, when she finally met Yang Kai, she had immediately asked him for assistance. Now though, after receiving Yang Kai’s reminder, her beautiful face suddenly lost colour.</p>
<p>Lu Ying had experienced firsthand how powerful that Monster Beast was. Even with all four of them together, they had barely been able to resist it, so even if she brought Yang Kai back with her, with his low cultivation, what help could he provide them? Most like he would only wind up as another victim.</p>
<p>For a time, Lu Ying froze up as her thoughts were in complete chaos.</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai did not readily agree, he still asked, “What type of Monster Beast was it? How strong was it exactly?”</p>
<p>Lu Ying replied subconsciously, “It is a Thunder Attribute Monster Beast that has strength equal to a First Order Origin Returning Realm master; however, it was able to use the Thunder Pond where it lives to create a barrier and raise its strength, otherwise Senior Sister Chen and the others wouldn’t have been trapped and would have already escaped. Even if they could not defeat it, running away shouldn’t have been a problem.”</p>
<p>“Thunder Pond?” Before Yang Kai could say anything, Yang Yan’s eyes lit up as she called out in interest.</p>
<p>“En, there is a Thunder Pond here that not many people know of. This time, Senior Sister Chen’s younger brother, Chen Fan Lei, wanted to use that Thunder Pond to break through a bottleneck he was facing with his Secret Art, but that Monster Beast suddenly appeared,” Lu Ying quickly explained.</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced over at Yang Yan only to have her voice reach his ear, “I want the Thunder Liquid in that Thunder Pond!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai sighed, knowing that this time he would have to take a detour. Without even mentioning that, in the first place, he had not intended to stand by and do nothing. Since Yang Yan was interested in that Thunder Liquid, it was definitely a good treasure she had an important use for.</p>
<p>His objections just now were just Yang Kai’s way of acting cautiously.</p>
<p>Having reached this point, Yang Kai no longer hesitated and said, “Sister Lu Ying should lead the way then. Although this Yang’s strength is not high, since Sister Chen is in danger, I cannot just remain indifferent; however, I cannot promise you anything, only that I will try my best to help.”</p>
<p>“Ah?” Lu Ying’s face turned from worry to happiness when she heard this. From how Yang Kai was speaking just now, she had assumed he was unwilling to get involved, but somehow, in the blink of an eye, his attitude had changed entirely. With great joy, she immediately nodded and led the way.</p>
<p>However, she did not seem to have much faith in Yang Kai’s abilities as along the way, she would release her Divine Sense from time to time, trying to see if there were any other more powerful cultivators nearby.</p>
<p>But to her disappointment, she found no one.</p>
<p>On the way, through a series of questions, Yang Kai also learned that the main purpose of Lu Ying’s group’s visit to Grand Burial Valley this time was the Thunder Pond. Originally, everything had gone according to plan; after finding the Thunder Pond, Chen Fan Lei entered it and began circulating his Secret Art to absorb the Thunder Attribute energy into his body while the other three stood guard. But a few days later, a Silver Night Thunder Beast suddenly rushed out from the depths of the Thunder Pond, causing Chen Fan Lei’s breakthrough to fail. This Silver Night Thunder Beast seemed to possess quite a high level of intelligence as it was able to stimulate an ancient Spirit Array around the Thunder Pond, activating a barrier that trapped their group of four inside. This Monster Beast was obviously intent on killing the four cultivators who had broken into the Thunder Pond it perceived as its domain.</p>
<p>Because Lu Ying had an artifact which was specially designed to help her escape, Chen Shi Tao joined forces with Wang Yu Han and Chen Fan Lei to forcefully tear open a part of the barrier and let her out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the barrier that was activated by the Thunder Pond could draw power from it to repair itself, so the other three did not have time to escape and were still trapped inside.</p>
<p>It had been a full day and a night since Lu Ying escaped to find help, so she currently could not tell what the situation was back there.</p>
<p>“After such a long time, I don’t think things are optimistic,” Yang Kai sighed slightly.</p>
<p>“No,” Lu Ying quickly shook her head, “Senior Sister Chen has a powerful defensive artifact, so even if they can’t defeat that Monster Best, holding out for some time shouldn’t be a problem.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>Lu Ying took the initiative to explain, “Actually, it’s all thanks to Senior Brother Yang. Last time, in the Flowing Flame Sand Field, we collected a lot of Saint Crystals, and after returning, we handed most of them over the Sect. As a reward, the Elders gave all of us some rare artifacts. Senior Sister Chen was given a Nine Palace Heavenly Silk Parasol, an Origin Grade High-Rank defensive artifact. Senior Sister Chen had long ago finished refining it so she can control it with ease. The escape artifact I used was also granted to me by the Elders, otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to flee with just my strength.”</p>
<p>“I see!” Hearing this, Yang Kai also relaxed slightly. Since she had an Origin Grade High-Rank’s defensive artifact, Chen Shi Tao should not have any major problems in a short span of time. If this were not the case, the only thing Yang Kai would be able to do when he arrived, would be to collect Chen Shi Tao’s corpse.</p>
<p>The Thunder Pond was not close to the position their group of three met, so it took some time to travel to it.</p>
<p>Yang Kai constantly kept an eye on their surroundings for fear that Corpse Soldiers or Corpse Generals would suddenly emerge to chase him down. After all, he could not be sure those creatures back in the Corpse Cave would simply let him go. Agreeing to rescue Chen Shi Tao involved a certain amount of risk.</p>
<p>When they approached to within ten kilometres of the Thunder Pond, Lu Ying pointed ahead and said with pleasant surprise, “It’s over there, and it looks like Senior Sister Chen and the others are still safe and sound!”</p>
<p>There was no need to remind Yang Kai of this as he could tell there was a disturbance up ahead. In front of them, there was a patch of blue clouds, and among those clouds, there were bolts of lightning flickering back and forth. From time to time, a bolt or two of lightning would crack, carrying with it amazing momentum. With the blue clouds covering the region, even with the glow from the lightning, it was impossible to get a clear picture of what was happening; however, judging from the sounds of battle, it was obvious Chen Shi Tao and the others hadn’t died yet. However, Yang Kai noticed that the three auras inside the cloud bank were somewhat weak, so even though they had managed to endure until now, they were likely approaching their limit.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai said without hesitation, “Let’s move.”</p>
<p>In an instant, Yang Kai rushed out a distance of nearly a thousand metres while Lu Ying followed close behind. At the same time, she let out a sweet voice like that of a chirping bird. Each chirp contained information that outsiders couldn’t detect.</p>
<p>When she heard this voice, Chen Shi Tao, who was struggling to support herself beside the Thunder Pond, exclaimed, “It’s Junior Sister Lu Ying! She brought help, so we’re saved.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Wang Yu Han and Chen Fan Lei’s spirits were roused and they began urging the defensive artifacts in their hands even harder to resist the lightning attacking them.</p>
<p>Thanks to the three of them cooperating, focusing only on defending themselves and not even counterattacking, they had managed to persist until now.</p>
<p>“Senior Sister Chen!” A moment later, Lu Ying’s voice came from outside the barrier.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao quickly turned her head and with a joyful voice called out, “Junior Sister Lu Ying, you found help?”</p>
<p>“En, I didn’t fail Senior Sister’s expectations. I brought Senior Brother Yang back with me,” Lu Ying nodded quickly.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother Yang?” Chen Shi Tao was stunned and looked behind Lu Ying to see Yang Kai standing there solemnly, observing the situation without saying a word.</p>
<p>“Little Brother Yang...” Chen Shi Tao did not know whether to laugh or cry, she had never thought that the helper Lu Ying found was actually Yang Kai. Although she recognized him as a man of great destiny, good luck would not help in the current situation. Relying on destiny and luck here would likely just end up with all of them dying.</p>

<p>Chapter 1302, Silver Night Thunder Beast</p>

<p>After learning that the helper Lu Ying had found was Yang Kai, Chen Shi Tao’s mood immediately became somewhat complicated as her lips curled into a bitter smile. Although she was interested in establishing a friendship with Yang Kai so she could invite him to adventure and travel with her in the future, if they could not overcome their current crisis, what point was there in planning for the future?</p>
<p>Yang Kai was only a Second-Order Saint King, so how was he supposed to break the barrier and rescue the three of them?</p>
<p>However, despite all of this, he had still come to help them, so while Chen Shi Tao was disappointed in her heart, she still sent out some words of gratitude. Wang Yu Han of Extreme Path Sect, on the other hand, shouted angrily, “What use is there in bringing him here? The three of us struggled desperately to let you escape yet he was the best you could find? It’s like you’re looking forward to us dying sooner!”</p>
<p>Although he had not cursed directly, his words were nothing short of harsh.</p>
<p>Lu Ying’s small face turned somewhat pale as she directed a guilty and uneasy look towards Wang Yu Han.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao’s pretty face also sank though as she harshly rebuked, “Senior Brother Wang, don’t you think you’ve said too much? Did you forget just where we are? Ordinarily, no one will come to this Grand Burial Valley, Junior Sister Lu Ying being able to find and bring back Little Brother Yang is already a stroke of good fortune, what more do you want?”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao reprimanding him without any trace of politeness caused Wang Yu Han’s face to become sullen. Although he did not refute her argument, it was obvious he did not agree with her either.</p>
<p>Yang Kai, who was standing outside the barrier, finally shifted his gaze from what he was staring at to Wang Yu Han for a moment before silently turning away again. Although Yang Kai didn’t appreciate Wang Yu Han’s tone or words, he was disinclined to bother with him so he simply ignored him.</p>
<p>What Yang Kai was currently focused on was the barrier and Silver Night Thunder Beast in front of him.</p>
<p>There was no need to wonder why there was a sealing Spirit Array here. The Thunder Pond’s presence here clearly indicated that this was once a Restricted Area of ​​Ancient Yang Sect. It was probably developed for cultivators who cultivated Thunder Attribute Secret Arts or Martial Skills. However, what method the Silver Night Thunder Beast had used to deploy this barrier and trap Chen Shi Tao and her group inside was a mystery.</p>
<p>The Silver Night Thunder Beast was a pure Thunder Attribute Monster Beast, so with control of the local barrier and the Thunder Pond, it occupied a great advantage and was able to display strength far in excess of its own, just as Lu Ying had described.</p>
<p>This Silver Night Thunder Beast’s appearance was quite weird. It had an ox head, deer body, and leopard tail, while sparks of lightning constantly ran across its skin, which itself was covered in a thick layer of extremely tough protective scales.</p>
<p>There were two curved horns extending from its forehead between which sparks of lightning bounced. Every time it swung its giant head, the blue clouds around it seemed to respond by releasing a bolt of lightning towards its horns. After absorbing these bolts of lightning, the Silver Night Thunder Beast would then release a bolt of thunder towards Chen Shi Tao and her companions down below; however, the attack released from its two horns was clearly even stronger than the natural lightning it had pulled down from the sky above.</p>
<p>From time to time, this beast would also open its maw and spit out a ball of thunder. When this thunder ball struck Chen Shi Tao and the others, it would burst into a myriad of lightning snakes that twisted about in unpredictable patterns.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao’s trio were currently hiding behind an umbrella giving off strong energy fluctuations that had created a ten-metre diametre light curtain. Across this umbrella’s surface there were flowing runes and glowing lines. It was clearly the Nine Palace Heavenly Silk Parasol Origin Grade High-Rank defensive artifact Lu Ying had told Yang Kai about on their way here.</p>
<p>When any Thunder Attribute attack came into contact with this Nine Palace Heavenly Silk Parasol’s defensive shield, their power would be dramatically reduced.</p>
<p>Yang Kai observed for a moment and immediately knew that if it were not for this defensive artifact, Chen Shi Tao’s trio would have long ago perished.</p>
<p>AlthoughChen Shi Tao was able to intercept most of the attacks from the Silver Night Thunder Beast with this excellent defensive artifact, the trio were still in quite a distressed state. A multi-coloured screen that floated in front of Wang Yu Han was clearly another defensive artifact and he was using it to block any attacks that Chen Shi Tao failed to stop. When any lightning arc hit this screen, it would mysteriously vanish, disappearing to some unknown place.</p>
<p>Lastly, Chen Fan Lei, like the Silver Night Thunder Beast, had arcs of lightning rippling across his body. He was not making any obvious defensive movements but was instead swallowing the scattered lightning into his mouth.</p>
<p>Among the three, he seemed to be the most relaxed. It seemed the scattered lightning was not only unable to hurt him but could even enhance his strength.</p>
<p>This drew Yang Kai’s attention and he quickly speculated that this young man either had some kind of Special Constitution or cultivated a very profound Secret Art as, even now, his eyes were bright and full of energy.</p>
<p>The three of them each stood with their backs to one another to defend against the Silver Night Thunder Beast’s assault, and there didn’t seem to be any immediate risk to their lives, but if this situation dragged on, it would only be a matter of time until Chen Shi Tao and Wang Yu Han’s Saint Qi was exhausted, at which point, all three of them would die. At that point, even if Chen Fan Lei had a Special Constitution or cultivated a profound Secret Art, he would not be spared.</p>
<p>“Little Brother Yang,” Chen Shi Tao shouted out during a break in the Silver Night Thunder Beast’s attacks, “If you have any way means to help us, please hurry, we won’t be able to last much longer!”</p>
<p>She saw that since he arrived, Yang Kai had simply been standing still, neither taking action nor showing any intention to leave, causing her to grow a bit anxious.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai just said, “Wait a moment.”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao’s expression immediately became bitter, but she did not urge him anymore. On the other hand, Wang Yu Han glared at Yang Kai coldly, as if silently telling him to scram if he was not going to help.</p>
<p>Lu Ying entered the battle without any hesitation, but blocked by the barrier, she was only able to attack from the outside in hopes of being able to break it.</p>
<p>Besides Yang Kai, no one else noticed that Yang Yan had secretly begun to crack this Spirit Array. Yang Kai had naturally handed this matter over to Yang Yan, which was why he had not taken action yet.</p>
<p>This barrier was clearly quite extraordinary, and with the Thunder Pond as an energy source, it clearly couldn’t be broken through brute force in a short time, so why would Yang Kai waste his energy trying?</p>
<p>A moment later though, Yang Yan suddenly whispered, “You can begin. It will take me a certain amount of time to crack this barrier completely, it will be quicker if you just attack it directly; but I’ve already removed the connection between the Thunder Pond and the Barrier. Without its energy source, you should be able to destroy now.”</p>
<p>“Good!” Yang Kai nodded and once again summoned his Hundred Mountains Picture, but this time was different from when he rescued Chen Shi Tao previously. As soon as the Hundred Mountains Picture appeared, Yang Kai summoned out twenty phantom peaks, each one bigger than the last; then, under Yang Kai’s urging, these peaks slammed towards the barrier mercilessly.</p>
<p>“Hmph, I was wondering if he had some kind of profound skill, but in the end, he’s still just relying on brute force. Sister Chen, we can’t rely on this little brat, we have to find a way to overcome this crisis on our own!” Seeing Yang Kai use the exact same method as last time, Wang Yu Han couldn’t help snorting disdainfully, “Can’t he see that with this Thunder Pond here as an energy source, trying to break this barrier by force is pointless?”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao also couldn’t help frowning slightly as she thought Yang Kai’s actions were indeed a bit rash, but the way Wang Yu Han was speaking also made her quite uncomfortable, so for a moment, her pretty face became complication and she didn’t know how to answer.</p>
<p>As the two of them spoke though, the illusionary mountains smashed onto the barrier, causing it to creak under the impact, but in the next moment, Thunder Attribute Energy welled up to seek the Thunder Pond to replenish the energy of the barrier.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao and Wang Yu Han had witnessed this countless times, and it was precisely because of this that they had not wasted their energy attacking the barrier. With the Thunder Pond supplementing any loss the barrier experienced, it was all but impossible for them to break it.</p>
<p>However, to their surprise, this time, for some unknown reason, the Thunder Attribute Energy from the Thunder Pond didn’t flow into the barrier but instead rushed out of it towards a certain direction, failing to supplement the losses it had just suffered.</p>
<p>Looking outside the barrier, Chen Shi Tao and Wang Yu Han spotted a piece of seemingly dead wood that was absorbing the Thunder Attribute Energy and channeling it harmlessly into the earth.</p>
<p>This surprised and delighted them while it also caused them to wonder how this trivial piece of dead wood was able to play such a magical role.</p>
<p>Yang Kai also had no idea what was happening, but he had absolute confidence in Yang Yan. Seeing that this method to divert the Thunder Pond’s energy was effective, Yang Kai spared no effort to urge the power of the Hundred Mountains Picture and continued to smash the barrier.</p>
<p>Yang Kai truly did not want to delay here for long, so he didn’t hold back his strength, causing the power the Hundred Mountains Picture displayed to be several times greater than last time. Seeing this, Chen Shi Tao could not help feeling shocked as she realized that Yang Kai had been concealing much of his strength until now.</p>
<p>With Yang Kai smashing the barrier from the outside, the Silver Night Thunder Beast inside obviously was not going to just sit back and ignore him. Releasing a roar that sounded like a cross between an ox and a tiger, it condensed a bolt of lightning as thick as a human leg atop its two horns and blasted it towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Little Brother Yang, watch out!” Chen Shi Tao shouted hurriedly as she knew just what kind of power this attack contained. Without her Nine Palace Heavenly Silk Parasol, she would not dare to take this attack head on. Yang Kai was only a Second-Order Saint King though, so if he was hit by this attack, he would likely be killed.</p>
<p>What surprised her though was that although Yang Kai heard her warning, he just stood there without moving. Instead, in front of him, a shield that emitted a purple glow suddenly appeared. In a flash of light, a sandstorm appeared from this purple shield.</p>
<p>With a loud crackling, the lightning bolt plunged into this sandstorm and was quickly scattered by the swirling wind and sand, soon disappearing without a trace.</p>
<p>“Origin Grade High-Rank defensive artifact!” Wang Yu Han shouted as a greedy light flashed across his eyes.</p>
<p>He was an Extreme Path Sect disciple and had a Third-Order Saint King cultivation, but so far, he hadn’t been able to obtain a single Origin Grade Mid-Rank or above artifact. Chen Shi Tao had been given her artifact by her Sect’s Elders, but where had this brat surnamed Yang gotten his?</p>
<p>And just from a cursory glance, the defensive power of this purple shield seemed no worse than the Nine Palace Heavenly Silk Parasol.</p>
<p>Comparing these artifacts with his own, Wang Yu Han suddenly thought he was quite poor and unavoidably felt resentful.</p>
<h2>1303</h2>
<p>Chapter 1303, Thunder Pond Thunder Liquid</p>
<p>While Wang Yu Han was eyeing Yang Kai’s shield artifact, the Silver Night Thunder Beast roared loudly, as if enraged because its attack had failed. Suddenly, it began using only half of its energy to deal with Chen Shi Tao’s group while focusing the other half of its energy on Yang Kai. The two curved horns atop its forehead flashed brilliantly as it opened its great maw and sent out crackling booms of thunder.</p>
<p>This development caused Chen Shi Tao’s trio to rejoice because the pressure they were facing suddenly eased greatly and the almost non-stop attacks that had originally been solely targeted on them were now being split between them and Yang Kai. The three of them exchanged a quick glance and quickly took advantage of the situation; Chen Shi Tao continued using her Nine Palace Heavenly Silk Parasol to defend their group while Wang Yu Han and Chen Fan Lei both summoned their offensive artifacts and began bombarding the barrier.</p>
<p>For a time, the area around the Thunder Pond became quite lively, with assorted burst of Saint Qi exploding and many artifacts displaying great might.</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han and Chen Fan Lei both had some status in Extreme Path Sect, so the artifacts they owned weren’t low quality. While they weren’t qualified to own Origin Grade High-Rank artifacts, both of them had one or two of Origin Grade Low-Rank. Under their combined attacks, the barrier quickly became unstable.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the two knew that they were having an effect and didn’t dare have any reservations, instantly pushing their strength even harder. Even Lu Ying seemed to be encouraged by this and increase the strength of her attacks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, outside the barrier, protected by his Purple Shield, Yang Kai was naturally unafraid of the Silver Night Thunder Beast’s long range attacks, and after seeing that he had managed to attract the majority of this Monster Beast’s attention, he urged the power of the Hundred Mountains Picture even further, smashing the phantom peaks down with even greater force.</p>
<p>With everyone cooperating from inside and outside, the Thunder Attribute barrier which originally left Chen Shi Tao and her group helpless grew dim within ten breaths and spider web like cracks began to form across its surface. Obviously, it was on the verge of collapsing.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Wang Yu Han knew that it was a good opportunity to show off and immediately summoned a blue long sword into his hands. Holding this sword in front of himself, he bit his tongue and spat a mouthful of blood mist onto it, causing the blue long sword to buzz loudly and take on a radiant glow. It was as if this blue long sword had come to life and was desperately struggling to free itself from Wang Yu Han’s grasp.</p>
<p>After Wang Yu Han sprayed out this blood mist, an abnormal blush flashed across his face. Obviously, the technique he was about to use had cost him a considerable price.</p>
<p>As the long sword cried out, Wang Yu Han’s aura rapidly inflated. Lifting his sword up high, a dazzling glow burst for as he leapt straight towards the barrier.</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han himself was wrapped up in this sword glow and it seemed as if he had almost merged together with it. In an instant, Wang Yu Han reached the barrier and as he slammed into it, countless small lightning arcs exploded forth, seemingly trying to smother the brilliant sword glow.</p>
<p>A cold snort suddenly sounded as a fierce buzzing from the sword glow competed with the crackling lightning arcs, the two completely different forces seemingly falling into a kind of stalemate as an ear piercing grating sound rang out.</p>
<p>This stalemate only lasted a moment though before Wang Yu Han suddenly roared, “Break!”</p>
<p>As soon as he uttered these words, the sword wave surrounding him suddenly inflated and sliced a large hole through the barrier. Thunder Light exploded out in all directions but after a crisp crackling resounded, the barrier surrounding the Thunder Pond was finally completely broken.</p>
<p>Since Yang Kai first took action until now, only about twenty breaths of time had passed.</p>
<p>This result was because Yang Kai didn’t want to waste time here and had gone all out, but it was also because Chen Shi Tao and her companions weren’t ordinary Saint King Realm cultivators. They were the elites of their respective Sects, so whether it was in terms of purity or density, the Saint Qi flowing through their bodies was far greater than that of average cultivators in the same realm.</p>
<p>In addition, the barrier here was only opened by the Silver Night Thunder Beast, and although it was still unknown how it accomplished this, it was obvious that it didn’t understand how to manipulate it, resulting in a failure to use its full might. If it had been able to skillfully manipulate this Thunder Attribute Spirit Array, even if everyone had been working together, breaking it would have been quite difficult.</p>
<p>The moment the barrier was broken, Chen Shi Tao and her brother rushed out of it, neither of them willing to remain where they were a moment longer.</p>
<p>Clearly, they were still feeling some lingering fear.</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han fell from the sky with a laugh, a proud look upon his face, flourishing his blue long sword before assuming an aloof pose, seemingly waiting for others to praise him.</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei looked at him with admiration and said sincerely, “Senior Brother is amazing!”</p>
<p>Receiving the cooperation of his Junior Brother, Wang Yu Han was naturally quite pleased and even spoke a few humble words while constantly shooting Yang Kai a somewhat provocative gaze.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it a bit premature to be celebrating?” Chen Shi Tao splashed cold water on Wang Yu Han in the next instant though as she stared solemnly towards the extremely angry Silver Night Thunder Beast floating nearby.</p>
<p>It seemed that because the barrier was destroyed, the Silver Night Thunder Beast was releasing an even more ominous Monster Qi and the blue clouds up above were emitting stronger pressure than before.</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han’s face twitched slightly before he spoke confidently, “Junior Sister Chen need not worry, it was only because we were somewhat negligent before that we fell into the trap laid by that thing, causing us to be unable to display our full power. Now that we’ve escaped from that barrier though, naturally we won’t give it any chance to fight back. Junior Brother, join me in testing its might!”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Chen Fan Lei wore an eager look on his face and nodded repeatedly without thinking.</p>
<p>Before Chen Shi Tao could persuade them otherwise, the two Sect Brothers from Extreme Path Sect rushed up.</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned, but was too lazy to stop them. He had taken this little trip firstly because he owed Chen Shi Tao a favor. To fulfill that, he resolved Lu Ying’s plea for help. Secondly, it was because Yang Yan needed the Thunder Liquid from the Thunder Pond. With debts repaid, as for whether the others lived or died, that was none of his concern.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai couldn’t help wondering whether this Wang Yu Han simply overconfident or flat out foolish, actually underestimating a Monster Beast equivalent to an Origin Returning Realm master. From Yang Kai’s perspective, it looked like Wang Yu Han was the kind of cultivator who only remained inside his Sect and never experienced any real life or death fights in the outside world.</p>
<p>Such people generally had high cultivations but were ultimately unable to display their strength in real combat, often resulting in them suffering losses or even dying as they couldn’t adapt to situations were rules no longer existed.</p>
<p>Yang Kai thought Wang Yu Han and Chen Fan Lei would definitely suffer a big loss!</p>
<p>To Yang Kai’s surprise though, after recklessly charging the Silver Night Thunder Beast, Wang Yu Han and Chen Fan Lei actually launched a coordinated and efficient campaign. No cultivator without real combat experience could accomplish this.</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han proved himself quite flexible in combat and was able to make rational judgements even while engaged in a dangerous fight, so although he and Chen Fan Lei had no way to easily kill this Silver Night Thunder Beast, they had no trouble fighting with it by taking advantage of their mobility, artifacts, and Martial Skills.</p>
<p>For a time, the Silver Night Thunder Beast was unable to cope with the two of them.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s brow rose as he realized that these two rushing forward was not just due to recklessness but because of confidence.</p>
<p>After observing anxiously for a while, Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying’s two pairs of beautiful eyes flashed with fierce light as they too began having thoughts of killing this beast and obtaining its core.</p>
<p>A Ninth-Order Monster Beast’s Monster Core, especially one from this Thunder Attribute Silver Night Thunder Beast, was incredibly valuable. Whether it was used for Alchemy or Artifact Refining, there would be many people who wanted it. On top of that, the materials from this Monster Beast’s body were also good things.</p>
<p>It seemed that because they had previously been trapped and suppressed inside that barrier, Wang Yu Han and Chen Fan Lei were feeling quite indignant, so now that they had escaped, their killing intent towards this Silver Night Thunder Beast was quite strong. The two fellow Sect Brothers cooperated flawlessly, one of them attacking while the other defended and soon showing signs of suppressing the Silver Night Thunder Beast. Without the barrier to rely on, the Silver Night Thunder Beast actually fell into a slight disadvantage in this battle, and if it weren’t for its thick scales, it would likely have already been injured. This development made Wang Yu Han and Chen Fan Lei pleasantly surprised and they began acting even more fiercely.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t pay any attention to the thoughts of these four, instead shoot Yang Yan a slight glance. Yang Yan saw this and nodded lightly, quickly rushing over to the Thunder Pond and taking out a special container. As soon as she began pouring her Saint Qi into this bottle, it began drawing in the Thunder Liquid from the Thunder Pond.</p>
<p>This Thunder Pond was only about a hundred metres or so in diameter, but it was deep enough that one was unable to see its bottom. The liquid it was composed of was also not ordinary water, but instead a kind of liquefied Thunder Attribute energy.</p>
<p>This kind of Thunder Pond could be artificially manufactured as long as there was something that could attract the natural Heavenly Thunder to this place and some powerful Spirit Arrays were set up to trap and condense it into Thunder Attribute energy. With this kind of setup, after a hundred years or so, the embryonic form of a Thunder Pond could be created. If other Thunder Attribute treasures or spirit herbs were added during this time, they would also speed up the formation of the Thunder Pond.</p>
<p>Of course, some Thunder Ponds were naturally produced.</p>
<p>Regardless of their type, Thunder Ponds were quite scarce, but they were of great benefit to cultivators who cultivated Thunder Attribute Secret Arts or Martial Skill. This Thunder Pond in Grand Burial Valley was originally owned by Ancient Yang Sect, and many cultivators knew of its existence, hence why Chen Shi Tao and her group had come here.</p>
<p>But they hadn’t anticipated that a Silver Night Thunder Beast actually lived at the bottom of this Thunder Pond and would suddenly appear while Chen Fan Lei was cultivating. Fortunately, this Silver Night Thunder Beast seemed to have only reached the Ninth-Order recently, otherwise the situation would have been far more dangerous.</p>
<p>Even so, Chen Shi Tao’s group being able to escape this crisis was mostly thanks to Yang Kai’s arrival.</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han and Chen Fan Lei entangling the Silver Night Thunder Beast gave Yang Yan the perfect opportunity to collect Thunder Liquid, so Yang Kai was happy to let them do as they pleased. After gathering up this Thunder Liquid, whether these four stayed here to fight the Silver Night Thunder Beast, Yang Kai couldn’t care less.</p>
<p>He only wanted to escape as far away from this dangerous place as quickly as possible!</p>
<p>The battle up above grew fiercer by the moment and at a certain point, the Silver Night Thunder Beast let out a great roar and released a giant thunder ball from its mouth that exploded between Chen Fan Lei and Wang Yu Han. Although this attack wasn’t able to hurt them, it did force them to focus on defending themselves.</p>
<p>The Silver Night Thunder Beast took advantage of this opportunity to suddenly fall motionless mid-air, lift its huge beast head to the sky, and let out a grand roar filled with unparalleled rage.</p>

<p>As the Thunder Beast roared, it seemed that the blue clouds up above were drawn to it, and under the astonished gazes of everyone present, a great funnel formed high in the sky and drew the surrounding Thunder Attribute Energy into the body of the Silver Night Thunder Beast madly.</p>
<p>In just three breaths of time, the blue clouds that once filled the sky completely disappeared, all of them being sucked into the body of the Silver Night Thunder Beast.</p>
<p>Yang Kai saw this and his eyes couldn’t help but shrink as his hair suddenly stood on end. Although the Silver Night Thunder Beast did not seem to change at all, he now felt a slightly dangerous aura coming from it.</p>
<p>At that moment, Wang Yu Han and Chen Fan Lei, who originally saw the Silver Night Thunder Beast come to a halt, wanted to rush in and land a fatal blow. But before they could even approach it, the Silver Night Thunder Beast suddenly turned its giant eyes towards them while flashing a look of disdain and ridicule on its face.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a terrifying coercion burst from the Silver Night Thunder Beast. After absorbing all the blue clouds just now, it seemed its strength had dramatically increased.</p>
<p>It was not until he felt this sudden increase in pressure that Wang Yu Han finally realized what was happening and exclaimed, “Not good!”</p>
<p>Abruptly turning around, a multi-coloured prism the size of a palm flew out from Wang Yu Han’s body and immediately transformed into a protective shield around him. Chen Fan Lei also realized the situation had become perilous and quickly summoned a powerful looking Battle Armour comprised of Lightning to cover his body.</p>
<p>However, the Silver Night Thunder Beast ignored their attempts to defend themselves and its figure flickered in the next moment, as if transforming into a bolt of lightning that disappeared from sight. In the next instant, both Wang Yu Han and Chen Fan Lei let out pitiful cries as they were swatted from the sky, seemingly having suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>The multi-coloured barrier protecting Wang Yu Han’s body had shattered while Chen Fan Lei’s Lightning Battle Armour had gone completely dim. Both of their faces had gone pale and they simultaneously coughed up blood. Clearly, they were severely injured.</p>
<p>This change happened in the blink of an eye, and Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying, who had been standing to the side until now, could not help going pale as they called out in alarm. All thoughts of joining in this battle disappeared from their minds as they each rushed out to rescue their companions and inspect their injuries.</p>
<p>Back up in the sky, the previously disappeared Silver Night Thunder Beast reappeared, but this time its cold gaze was focused on Yang Yan, who was standing beside the Thunder Pond collecting Thunder Liquid. A trace of anger flashed across this beast’s eyes as its body flickered and vanished once more.</p>
<p>Sure enough, after absorbing the blue clouds, its strength had increased significantly.</p>
<p>Yang Yan stood in place, not moving, but with her instincts telling her that danger was approaching, she swiftly activated a protective artifact, creating a red-light barrier around herself. Almost as fast as this barrier formed, however, it was shattered as the Silver Night Thunder Beast appeared before her at a speed so great that she was barely able to see it.</p>
<p>Yang Yan’s face went pale, but she quickly calmed down.</p>
<p>Just as the Silver Night Thunder Beast was about to kill her, Yang Kai suddenly appeared in front of her, his fist wrapped in Demonic Flame as he sent out a punch.</p>
<p>There was a loud bang as a shockwave rippled outwards. Yang Kai couldn’t help being knocked backwards, but as he flew back, he made sure to grab hold of Yang Yan who was still standing in place. The Silver Night Thunder Beast, which had disappeared, also appeared with a low growl. It also seemed a bit unsteady as its huge body backpedalled, its four strong claws seemingly gripping at the air to stabilize itself.</p>
<p>As soon as it stood firm, the Thunder Beast let out a great roar and condensed a huge ball of thunder in its mouth. With a flick of its head, the ball of thunder shot forward towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression became solemn as he released a golden thread from his fingertips and instantly transformed it into a giant golden net. Engulfing the thunder ball with his golden net, Yang Kai forcefully cut it to pieces, causing it to explode into hundreds of individual pieces and dissipate.</p>
<p>The re-formed golden thread then shot out of the surging area of thunder and arrived right in front of the Silver Night Thunder Beast, stabbing at it like a spear.</p>
<p>A clinking sound rang out as dazzling sparks burst from the point where the golden thread impacted the Silver Night Thunder Beast. The incredibly sharp gold thread failed to completely penetrate the Silver Night Thunder Beast’s scales, only managing to sink a finger’s length in before it lost its forward momentum.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had seemingly anticipated this result though and stared coldly at the Silver Night Thunder Beast as a lotus flower mysteriously formed in his eyes. This Silver Night Thunder Beast was quite extraordinary and its realm was also higher than Yang Kai’s by a large amount, so Yang Kai decided to end the fight quickly by immediately using one of his trump cards.</p>
<p>When the Silver Night Thunder Beast saw this lotus, it instinctually felt danger and unease flashed across its pupils. It did not dare meet eyes with Yang Kai again and immediately dove into the Thunder Pond, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Ripples spread across the Thunder Pond for a moment before it once again calmed down.</p>
<p>His opponent fleeing without a fight surprised Yang Kai greatly.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai also could not help feeling relieved. To be honest, he was unwilling to fight a life or death battle with this Silver Night Thunder Beast right now, so the other party retreating on its own was an ideal outcome. Ordinarily, Yang Kai would not have been willing to let this Ninth-Order Thunder Beast leave.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying had only just picked up the injured Wang Yu Han and Chen Fan Lei and glanced over to see the Silver Night Thunder Beast flee in a panicked state. This scene dumbfounded them and caused them to wonder just what Yang Kai had done to scare off this formidable Monster Beast.</p>
<p>Exchanging a glance, the two women could see the suspicion in the other’s eyes.</p>
<p>At that moment, Yang Yan quietly handed Yang Kai a certain object and whispered something softly into his ear.</p>
<p>Hearing what she had to say, Yang Kai cast a thoughtful look towards the pale Wang Yu Han and flashed a meaningful grin. Wang Yu Han happened to cast a glance towards Yang Kai at that moment too, but facing him, he did not show the slightest bit of timidity, instead wearing a rather gloomy look upon his face.</p>
<p>“Little Brother Yang...” Chen Shi Tao walked over towards him while occasionally looking towards the Thunder Pond in surprise, asking after a short pause, “Was that Silver Night Thunder Beast injured?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure, it just suddenly retreated on its own.”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao was stunned and immediately smiled bitterly, “It looks like Little Brother Yang has hidden his abilities quite well. You’re even able to scare off this Silver Night Thunder Beast, it seems this Young Lady has looked down on you.”</p>
<p>“Sister Chen thinks too highly of me, it retreating has nothing to do with me, all the credit belongs to Brother Wang and your little brother. That Monster Beast probably realized it wasn’t their opponent, so it decided to escape while it had the chance.” Yang Kai responded faintly, not trying to take any credit.</p>
<p>“Exactly!” Wang Yu Han shouted out with no trace of politeness, “Obviously, it used some kind of forbidden technique to dramatically increase its strength temporarily but doing so clearly came at a very high cost. On top of that, it only recently reached the Ninth-Order, so it likely wasn’t able to suppress the backlash from its technique and took the initiative to retreat.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, the others present thought about it for a moment but no one raised any objections, implying that they tacitly approved of Wang Yu Han’s guess.</p>
<p>“Brother Wang seems to understand this Monster Beast’s situation quite clearly,” Yang Kai suddenly said with a smile.</p>
<p>“What?” Wang Yu Han frowned.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” Yang Kai waved his hand before turning to Chen Shi Tao, “Sister Chen, since everything here has been settled, I’ll say goodbye first.”</p>
<p>“Where do you want to go?” Chen Shi Tao asked.</p>
<p>“Away from here naturally,” Yang Kai replied casually, but upon seeing Chen Shi Tao’s awkward smile and somewhat disappointed expression, he let out a laugh and explained further, “After we separated last time, my companion and I became lost for a while, but we finally found the right direction to leave, so we shouldn’t have that issue again.”</p>
<p>The last time they parted ways, Yang Kai told Chen Shi Tao that he was going to leave this place, but after so many days had passed, him still being here made it seem like he had lied to her.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao did not show any intention to pursue the issue. Glancing around at her companions for a moment, she quickly declared, “We should leave too.”</p>
<p>“But Junior Brother still hasn’t completed his cultivation yet,” Wang Yu Han immediately objected, subconsciously not wanting to act together with Yang Kai. The seemingly offhanded comment Yang Kai had just made had caused Wang Yu Han to become wary and made him wonder if this brat had discovered something.</p>
<p>“Since there is a Ninth-Order Silver Night Thunder Beast here, it is naturally impossible for him to continue cultivating. We were lucky to escape from it this time, but if we continue to linger...”</p>
<p>“That Silver Night Thunder Beast is clearly injured now; with our combined strength, it shouldn’t be a problem to kill it,” Wang Yu Han suggested, clearly still having ideas about the ​​Silver Night Thunder Beast.</p>
<p>Listening to him say this, Chen Shi Tao also felt a bit conflicted, but after a moment of pondering, she turned to Yang Kai and asked, “Little Brother Yang, what do you think? Do you think that if we remain, we can kill that Silver Night Thunder Beast?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned slightly at this question. He could tell that while Chen Shi Tao seemed to be asking for his opinion, she was actually subtly inviting him to act together with them. If Yang Kai agreed to stay, Chen Shi Tao might really decide to stay and deal with the Thunder Beast, after all, she and her team all thought the Silver Night Thunder Beast was suffering from a severe backlash and as long as they could find a way to force it out of the Thunder Pond, they may be able to kill it.</p>
<p>Understanding this, Yang Kai immediately shook his head, “I don’t know if it can be killed, but I believe this isn’t a place to linger for long; after all, something unexpected may happen at any moment. If Sister Chen is willing to trust me, I’d suggest you leave quickly.”</p>
<p>He did not mention anything about the Corpse Cave, so his words came off a bit mysterious.</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han looked displeased upon hearing this and was about to say something when Chen Shi Tao suddenly nodded and said, “Since Little Brother Yang thinks so, let’s depart quickly. Fan Lei, your Secret Art does not necessarily require you to cultivate in this Thunder Pond, correct? Although it might have some lesser effect, it should still be possible for you to make a breakthrough with an appropriate Thunder Attribute pill. Just wait until we return to Black Crow City, I’ll help you buy one.”</p>
<p>She seemed to believe quite strongly in Yang Kai’s judgment.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Chen Fan Lei had no objections and simply agreed with his big sister’s decision.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao nodded before turning an elegant smile to Yang Kai, “Since that’s the case, let’s leave this place together, it will allow us to take care of one another along the way.”</p>
<p>It was impossible for Yang Kai to refuse her at this point so he simply nodded, and while Wang Yu Han was reluctant, he alone could not make a decision for everyone so he could only hold his nose and comply.</p>
<p>And so, the group of six people began heading out of Grand Burial Valley together.</p>
<h2>1305</h2>
<p>Chapter 1305, Processing</p>
<p>Along the way, Chen Shi Tao finally remembered to inquire about Yang Kai’s background. As such, she learned that Yang Kai was not a Shadow Moon Hall disciple, or even the disciple of some big family force, but instead a lone cultivator who lived on a remote hill called Dragon Cave Mountain.</p>
<p>To put it simply, Yang Kai was a cultivator with no backing or support, someone who had to depend entirely on himself to continue advancing. There were many such cultivators in this world, and their path was always quite difficult. Firstly, they did not have any Elders or masters to teach them, so they would inevitably run into problems during their cultivation that they could not solve. Secondly, they often lacked good cultivation environments and resources, resulting in their rate of advancement becoming slow. On top of these issues, if they ever encountered bullying or oppression, they did not have anyone who would help them. So, these kinds of cultivators had grim futures and despite there being a great many of them, those who succeeded were incredibly few, and those who did achieve success were often recruited by major Sects and families.</p>
<p>A lone cultivator being able to reach the Second-Order Saint King Realm like Yang Kai was already quite impressive.</p>
<p>When she learned about this, Chen Shi Tao felt a great sense of admiration towards Yang Kai, but Wang Yu Han only showed disdain. Obviously, from his perspective, while Yang Kai might be able to reach the Third-Order Saint King Realm, it was definitely impossible for him to break through to the Origin Returning Realm.</p>
<p>Not only did Chen Shi Tao admire Yang Kai greatly, her younger brother Chen Fan Lei also became quite interested in him. This young man was very open-minded and good-natured. On top of that, even though he was injured, he still seemed quite energetic and would constantly keep asking Yang Kai about what had happened in the Flowing Flame Sand Field. Yang Kai chose some insignificant stories to tell but even these were listened to by the young man with relish, prompting him to ask even more questions.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was quite harmonious as this group travelled together. The four people from Chen Shi Tao’s group, with the exception of Wang Yu Han who inherently disliked Yang Kai, were relatively easy to get along with.</p>
<p>Half a day later, the group of six finally left Grand Burial Valley. Until now, Yang Kai had not noticed any trace of those special existences from the Corpse Cave, something that made him feel relieved as he concluded that this matter was over, at least for now.</p>
<p>Another day later, a small mountain range appeared in front of the group; and although the World Energy aura here was not too rich, it also was not too thin. Seeing this place, Yang Kai’s brow furrowed slightly and he quickly came to a stop and called out to Chen Shi Tao, cupping his fists as he said, “Friends, although I do not know where you plan on going from here, I believe we’ll have to part ways here. My companion and I have some things to deal with, so we’d like to stay here for a few days.”</p>
<p>“How long do you plan to stay?” Chen Shi Tao’s eyes lit up, “It just so happens we’re also in need of a few days of rest. As I am sure you can see, Fan Lei and Senior Brother Wang haven’t had an opportunity to restore themselves or treat their injuries properly, so resting here for a moment would be a good idea.”</p>
<p>“You want to rest here too?” Yang Kai frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Could it be Little Brother Yang doesn’t welcome us?” Chen Shi Tao shot Yang Kai a slight look of rebuke.</p>
<p>“Nonsense, this place isn’t my property, it’s just an unclaimed mountain, naturally everyone can freely rest here.”</p>
<p>“That’s good,” Chen Shi Tao smiled, “And since Little Brother Yang came from Heavenly Fate City, he must intend to return there, correct?”</p>
<p>“En, of course.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, this place isn’t close to Heavenly Fate City. If you fly by Star Shuttle, it will take at least two or three months, and if you encounter something along the way, it may take even longer.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai gave her a thoughtful look and asked, “Does Sister Chen have a suggestion that could save us this time?”</p>
<p>“I do indeed. Little Brother Yang might not know, but five days from here is a city called Black Crow City that has a Space Array which is directly linked to Heavenly Fate City.”</p>
<p>“Is there such a thing?” Yang Kai could not help turning his head to look at Yang Yan, only to find that she had a blank face. Obviously, she didn’t know this either.</p>
<p>“Do you think this Young Lady would deceive you about something so simple?” Chen Shi Tao smiled, “Black Crow City is a neutral city that doesn’t belong to any force, so the Space Array doesn’t have as many usage restrictions as other places. Of course, not everyone can use it, but... Fan Lei seems to know a Senior who is responsible for guarding that Space Array, so it shouldn’t be an issue to let Little Brother Yang use it if he acts as a guarantor. It would just be a matter of having enough Saint Crystals for the transfer fee then.”</p>
<p>“As long as we can use it, Saint Crystals aren’t a problem,” Yang Kai looked at Chen Fan Lei with a happy expression.</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei grinned in response, “Brother Yang may rest assured, I helped that Senior who guards the Space Array with a small matter so he owes me a favour. It won’t be a problem obtaining his permission regarding this, not to mention, Brother Yang isn’t some unknown person.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, I’ll leave this matter to Brother Chen,” Yang Kai quickly thanked him before glancing down at the small hills below, “Then let’s stay here for a few days before continuing on to Black Crow City.”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao and her group naturally had no objections and quickly descended to the small mountain range.</p>
<p>Although Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying weren’t injured in the battle with the Silver Night Thunder Beast, they had consumed a great deal of their Saint Qi and had not had an opportunity to restore themselves until now, so even they needed some time to adjust their condition. As for Chen Fan Lei and Wang Yu Han, they needed to treat their injuries and restore themselves, so the four of them quickly found a small mountain peaks and soon vanished inside it.</p>
<p>Yang Kai and Yang Yan flew to another remote mountain.</p>
<p>After a while, the two arrived at their destination, and Yang Kai immediately used his Saint Qi to open a temporary residence in the hillside.</p>
<p>With Yang Kai’s current cultivation, opening such a cave mansion required little effort, and in just the time it would take a boil a cup of tea, he had carved out a simple hollow.</p>
<p>Entering this cave, Yang Kai’s face became solemn. Yang Yan also seemed to sense something and hurriedly followed him without saying a word.</p>
<p>After making their way inside, Yang Kai suddenly sat down cross-legged down.</p>
<p>“Is there something wrong with Xiao Xiao?” Yang Yan asked anxiously.</p>
<p>After swallowing the Sun’s True Essence, the Stone Puppet had been taken away by Yang Kai, so Yang Yan didn’t know what its current condition was, but she knew that Yang Kai suddenly wanting to rest here must be related to this matter.</p>
<p>“It’s not a major problem yet, but if we continue on like this, the Stone Puppet won’t be able to bear it,” Yang Kai sighed.</p>
<p>“I figured so. Even if you didn’t say anything, I would have asked you to find a spot and stop for a few days to process Xiao Xiao and the Sun’s True Essence,” Yang Yan commented before quickly taking out a few items from her Space Ring and arranging a simple Spirit Array inside the cave mansion.</p>
<p>She didn’t dare take the matter of the Sun’s True Essence lightly, so before letting the Stone Puppet come out, Yang Yan intended to arrange an Isolation Array; otherwise, once this supreme treasure’s aura leaked out, it would likely attract unwanted trouble.</p>
<p>With her mastery of Spirit Arrays, it was quite easy for Yang Yan to arrange a barrier to conceal all their auras. After half a day, the entire cave mansion was enveloped by an invisible barrier that even an Origin Returning Realm master would not be able to see through.</p>
<p>Only after this was completed did Yang Kai wave his hand and release the Stone Puppet from the Black Book Space.</p>
<p>As soon as the Stone Puppet appeared, the temperature in the entire cave mansion shot up. The Stone Puppet itself had become crimson red and the heat radiating from it was distorting the air around it. There were even signs of its body melting.</p>
<p>A look of unbearable pain filled the Stone Puppet’s face and its eyes had become extremely red.</p>
<p>The violent heat of the Sun’s True Essence was not something it could resist. The Stone Puppet even being able to persist until now was all thanks to its innate talents.</p>
<p>Seeing its situation, Yang Kai did not dare to hesitate and immediately took out the Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade Pedestal, causing a profound chill to ripple through the cave mansion and restore the temperature to a somewhat ordinary level.</p>
<p>Yang Kai used his Divine Sense to communicate with the Stone Puppet who, having received these instructions, stood up unsteadily and opened its mouth. A moment later, the Stone Puppet spat the Sun’s True Essence Ice out on top of the Ice Jade Pedestal.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai breathed a sigh of relief and beckoned to the Stone Puppet. After it arrived in front of him, Yang Kai began to carefully investigate its condition.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Yang Kai, although the Stone Puppet had suffered some damage, it was not too serious. As long as it rested for a while, it should be able to restore itself to its original condition. This made Yang Kai feel both relieved and optimistic about the Stone Puppet’s future potential.</p>
<p>Using his Divine Sense, Yang Kai told the Stone Puppet to refine the precious ores in its belly to repair itself before he took it back into the Black Book Space.</p>
<p>Previously, in the Corpse Cave, the Stone Puppet had devoured seven or eight hills of Saint Crystals and rare ores. Yang Kai did not know if Saint Crystals would provide the Stone Puppet with any benefits, but those rare ores would definitely be useful to its growth, so Yang Kai naturally would not be stingy with it. He also believed that after absorbing the mineral essence from those ores, the Stone Puppet would be as good as new, if not better.</p>
<p>Obtaining this piece of Sun’s True Essence was far more valuable than obtaining a few more pieces of ore.</p>
<p>Having processed the Stone Puppet, Yang Kai next turned to Yang Yan, “What should we do now? If the Stone Puppet cannot carry it for extended periods of time, how will we take it back to Dragon Cave Mountain with us?”</p>
<p>“It will be fine as long as I refine a special container for it,” Yang Yan seemed to have a plan in mind already and replied lightly.</p>
<p>“What materials do you want?”</p>
<p>“Naturally, I’ll need Ice Attribute materials, and that Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade Pedestal would be best. Relax, I know what kind of vessel will be appropriate, the only problem is that refining it will be a bit troublesome. I’ll need at least ten days to finish.”</p>
<p>“Ten days... En, that shouldn’t be a problem. They won’t be able to heal themselves so easily,” Yang Kai smiled slightly before getting up and setting out. Before he left, he gave the four Space Rings he collected from the Corpse Cave to Yang Yan as he believed the materials inside would meet the requirements for the special container Yang Yan planned to refine.</p>
<p>Not wanting to disturb Yang Yan, Yang Kai walked to the outermost part of the cave mansion and sat down cross-legged.</p>
<p>After thinking for a while, he took out his Origin King Grade Artifact Refining Furnace and used his Divine Sense to inspect it, receiving a pleasant surprise as he did.</p>
<p>Before collecting the Sun’s True Essence, Yang Kai had used his Artifact Spirit to face the Fire Dragon it produced to protect itself; however, the Artifact Spirit had been unable to handle the Sun’s True Essence and was wounded in the fight.</p>
<h2>1306</h2>
<p>Chapter 1306, Persuasion</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>Yang Kai had thought that the situation would be quite troublesome to deal with, but after examining the Artifact Spirit, he discovered that it had fallen into a kind of deep sleep inside the Artifact Refining Furnace. Although it still appeared somewhat weak and injured, it wasn’t as serious as Yang Kai had imagined, and there even seemed to be a trace of the Sun’s True Fire now circulating through its body, as if it was refining and absorbing it.</p>
<p>This Sun’s True Fire was visible to the naked eye and swam through the Artifact Spirit’s body like a tiny fire snake, but no matter how it struggled, it was incapable of escaping and was gradually being assimilated.</p>
<p>It seemed the Artifact Spirit had turned this misfortune into a blessing.</p>
<p>This made Yang Kai overjoyed; after all, in order to gather the Sun’s True Essence this time, both of his little assistants had suffered significant damage, making him quite depressed. Now that he knew that the Artifact Spirit was fine and the Stone Puppet’s injuries were not serious, Yang Kai was able to relax somewhat.</p>
<p>With the Artifact Spirit like this though, it was likely impossible for Yang Kai to use the Artifact Refining Furnace to continue refining the Dragon Bone and Dragon Bead. So instead, he simply sat on the spot, adjusting his breathing while taking inventory of the harvest from this trip.</p>
<p>In addition to the four Space Rings he had tossed to Yang Yan, there was a lot of Saint Crystals and rare minerals currently stored inside the Stone Puppet’s belly. There were also a few Secret Arts and Secret Books along with artifacts that originally belonged to the Ancient Yang Sect that Yang Kai had managed to collect.</p>
<p>It was needless to say that the artifacts would all be left to Yang Yan to handle as many of them would need to be repaired before they could be used. Moreover, Yang Kai did not need other artifacts to enhance his combat effectiveness, so he didn’t concern himself with these things greatly.</p>
<p>As for the Secret Arts and Secret Books, however, Yang Kai was at least interested in browsing through them.</p>
<p>After all, two thousand years ago, the Ancient Yang Sect was a force not inferior to Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect, so the Secret Arts and Secret Books owned by them must not be bad. What’s more, since these were placed in that Secret Cave, they were likely related to the core inheritance of the Ancient Yang Sect.</p>
<p>After a cursory inspection, Yang Kai found himself quite startled.</p>
<p>He found that, as he guessed, these Secret Arts and Secret Books were all profound works. If any of these manuals were to appear in the outside world, they would draw the interest of countless cultivators. Several of the Secret Arts and techniques in this collection were reserved for only the core members of the Ancient Yang Sect and were thus extremely high-grade. Many of these techniques were also quite profound and esoteric, to the point that even Origin Realm masters would be joyful to obtain one.</p>
<p>With Yang Kai’s current abilities and capital, there was no need for him to waste time and energy cultivating these things, but if he were to find some spare time, cultivating one or two sets of secret skills would increase his combat effectiveness and also increase the number of life-saving techniques he had at his disposal.</p>
<p>At the very least, Yang Kai was quite interested in several of these secret manuals.</p>
<p>However, when he remembered that he still had to cultivate his Golden Blood Threads, refine the Dragon Bone and Dragon Bead, cultivate Space Force, and refine the Coloured Glass Bead Dai Yuan had given him, Yang Kai could only set this matter aside for the moment and make a note to revisit these Secret Arts and Secret Books in the future.</p>
<p>Although he had the intention of cultivating many of these texts, reading through some of these Secret Arts and Secret Books still broadened Yang Kai’s knowledge and provided him with some inspiration for his cultivation. In particular, there was a set of Body Tempering Secret Arts that Yang Kai was very much interested in.</p>
<p>It was the first time he had encountered a Secret Art specifically dedicated to tempering one’s physique and refining their body.</p>
<p>The reason why Yang Kai’s physique was so powerful was thanks to his Unyielding Golden Skeleton, which had allowed him to store and use large quantities of Demonic Qi before, giving him some Demon Race physical qualities. On top of that, Yang Kai had various opportunities over the years which allowed him to enhance his physical strength.</p>
<p>However, now that he thought about it, when he first began cultivating and obtained the Unyielding Golden Skeleton, the Tempered Body Record he used should have also been a kind of Body Tempering Secret Art. However, this Secret Art was created by Great Demon God and obviously could not compare with the techniques of the Ancient Yang Sect.</p>
<p>It was not that Great Demon God’s aptitude was poor, but that he had only managed to reach the Saint King Realm before he died and had not been able to truly step out from Tong Xuan Realm. Naturally, a technique he created wouldn’t be a match the millennia-long inheritance of a great Sect.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not know what grade this Ancient Yang Sect Body Tempering Secret Art was, but after studying it for a time, he concluded that it wasn’t low. In fact, it was quite likely a priceless treasure. With his ability as an Origin Grade Alchemist, Yang Kai could also refine some Body Tempering pills that would presumably allow him to obtain twice the results with half the effort when he did begin cultivating this Secret Art, allowing him to save a great deal of time.</p>
<p>Deciding so, Yang Kai sat cross-legged in place and continued to refine his Golden Blood Threads while occasionally finding some time to review the mysteries of this Body Tempering Secret Art.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, eight days passed by.</p>
<p>During this period, the small mountain range remained completely calm, with nothing out of the ordinary happening, but this was not much of a surprise as this place was quite close to Grand Burial Valley so no one would come here usually. If it was a thousand years ago, the situation would definitely be different as many cultivators would be passing through to go ​​treasure hunting in the Grand Burial Valley.</p>
<p>But now, although some would still occasionally dive into Grand Burial Valley, their numbers had decreased sharply, and unless they had some kind of specific purpose, like Chen Shi Tao’s group, only fledgelings who wanted to quickly make their mark on the world or adventurous little brats would come here to try their luck. Most of these people, however, would not return safely after entering the Grand Burial Valley.</p>
<p>On this day, Yang Kai was meditating at the front of the cave mansion when his expression suddenly changed, and he looked up to see a blue streak of light quickly approaching. This person was not trying to conceal their presence at all, so Yang Kai was able to determine it was Chen Shi Tao riding her Star Shuttle.</p>
<p>Slowing the Saint Qi circulating through his body, Yang Kai waiting quietly for her to arrive.</p>
<p>A moment later, Chen Shi Tao floated down from above and landed not far away from Yang Kai, looking at him with a smile.</p>
<p>After a few days of meditation, Chen Shi Tao had apparently completely restored herself. At this moment, her complexion was like that of peach blossom and the shimmering quality of her eyes gave her a unique and enrapturing charm. After she landed, a faint aroma wafted from her body towards Yang Kai, causing his spirit to shake slightly.</p>
<p>“Sister Chen,” Yang Kai greeted her with a polite nod, raising his brow a bit as he commented, “Looking at Sister Chen’s complexion, it seems you’ve recovered completely, yes?”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao smiled, “Thank you for worrying, Little Brother Yang. Fortunately, I wasn’t injured, just somewhat exhausted, so after a few days of meditation my Saint Qi and strength had been restored.”</p>
<p>“En, that’s good. Does Sister Chen have something she needs to discuss? Or perhaps you are ready to leave?”</p>
<p>“Not yet,” Chen Shi Tao shook her head slowly, “While Fan Lei’s injuries were not too serious this time, they also were not light, so I’m afraid we’ll need to stay here for a few more days.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Good, I also happen to need a few days to finish a little something here.”</p>
<p>“This Young Lady came here this time specifically to thank Little Brother Yang for assisting us twice. Although the first time there was no risk to our lives, without Little Brother Yang coming to our aid the second time, I’m afraid it would have been difficult for us to leave Grand Burial Valley alive. I will not forget this graciousness. If Little Brother Yang ever needs this Young Lady’s help in the future, just come to Clear Sky Sect to call upon me, I will certainly not refuse!”</p>
<p>When she said these words, her face was serious and sincere.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled lightly and waved his hand, “I only helped you out a little bit. You being able to survive was all thanks to your own strength; after all, that Silver Night Thunder Beast took the initiative to retreat after it saw it couldn’t kill you without the help of that barrier.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Chen Shi Tao frowned, seemingly a bit puzzled. If that was really the case, the Silver Night Thunder Beast should not have taken the initiative to provoke them. During these past few days of meditation, Chen Shi Tao had been going over their encounter carefully but was still unable to understand why the Silver Night Thunder Beast had suddenly retreated.</p>
<p>Thinking it over though, she felt that it had something to do with Yang Kai, but under her subtle probe, Yang Kai had categorically denied her assumption, making her wonder if the Silver Night Thunder Beast’s retreat really was for the reason he gave.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t intend to discuss this issue further and simply said, “As for your thanks, there’s no need to go so far. When cultivators go out into the world, they will always encounter difficulties, and since we are not strangers, it is only natural for us to support one another. Perhaps next time this Yang will need Sister Chen’s assistance with something.”</p>
<p>On Chen Shi Tao pretty face, a fascinating smile appeared as she narrowed her eyes happily, “Being able to meet Little Brother Yang is really this Young Lady’s good fortune.”</p>
<p>“Because you believe I’m a person of great destiny?” Yang Kai laughed jokingly.</p>
<p>“Hehe...” Chen Shi Tao giggled, “Although I have no way to prove such a thing, this Young Lady has faith in her intuition. If not for me taking advantage of your luck, how could I be standing here with you now, speaking casually like this?”</p>
<p>“Alright. Sure, think whatever you’d like,” Yang Kai shook his head slowly, not trying to argue with her.</p>
<p>“Actually...” Chen Shi Tao began to say something but suddenly hesitated.</p>
<p>Yang Kai immediately knew that she should have something she felt awkward about asking him and immediately assumed the pose of a conscientious listener.</p>
<p>Noticing this, Chen Shi Tao slowly continued, “Actually, this time, this Young Lady came here first to thank you, but second to ask Little Brother Yang if he has any intention to join a Sect?”</p>
<p>“Join a Sect?” Yang Kai raised his brow slightly before smiling, “Could it be that Sister Chen wants to invite me to enter Clear Sky Sect?”</p>
<p>“Talking to smart people like Little Brother Yang really saves a lot of trouble,” Chen Shi Tao smiled and nodded, “I certainly had such an idea; after all, you are a lone cultivator with no Elders to guide you and no Sect to protect you. At present, you might not notice any significant drawbacks, but as your cultivation continues to grow, there will definitely be some situations that Little Brother Yang won’t be able to cope with on your own.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently nodded as he knew what she said made sense.</p>
<p>For example, Shi, the unique power Origin Returning Realm master’s possessed, was something Yang Kai had next to no knowledge about. When he had fought against the cultivator brought by Xie Hong Wen to Dragon Cave Mountain, because there were no Elders or Seniors to inform him about Shi, Yang Kai had fallen into a disadvantage during that fight.</p>
<p>After seeing Yang Kai’s thoughtful appearance, Chen Shi Tao became encouraged and hurriedly continued, “And, since you were able to cultivate to the Second-Order Saint King Realm all on your own, obviously your aptitude isn’t low, so entering Clear Sky Sect shouldn’t be difficult. Half a year later, Clear Sky Sect will hold a recruitment open to all of Shadowed Star. At that time, anyone who passes will be allowed to enter the Sect.”</p>
<h2>1307</h2>
<p>Chapter 1307, Warning</p>
<p>Of course, when you first enter the Sect, your status and treatment certainly won’t be too high, but given your cultivation state, as long as you complete a few tasks for the Sect, becoming an Inner Disciple won’t be a problem. If Little Brother Yang has any interest in participating in the trial, this Young Lady can give you a participation token.” Saying so, Chen Shi Tao looked at Yang Kai eagerly, seeming to really look forward to him joining her Sect.</p>
<p>After all, Yang Kai’s strength wasn’t low, and once they become fellow Sect disciples, she could openly invite him to travel together with her in the future.</p>
<p>Under her expectant eyes, Yang Kai couldn’t help sighing to himself and not immediately refusing. This made Chen Shi Tao feel like there was a chance of success so she decided to strike while the iron was hot, but Yang Kai quickly cut her off, “I’m afraid I’ll have to decline Sister Chen’s good intentions; temporarily, I have no plans to enter any Sect.”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao’s expression drooped at Yang Kai’s surprise answer.</p>
<p>Yang Kai proceeded to explain with a smile, “If I was really alone, I wouldn’t mind entering a Sect, but Sister Chen has seen that I have my own companions.”</p>
<p>“You mean that Sister Yang Yan?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded and said, “Not only her, but there are several dozen as well.”</p>
<p>“Several dozens...” Chen Shi Tao was stunned.</p>
<p>“Yeah, and their cultivations vary greatly. There are a few Origin Returning Realm masters, some Saint King Realm, but also a number who are just Immortal Ascension, Transcendent, and Saint Realm cultivators,” Yang Kai smiled slightly.</p>
<p>“This...” Chen Shi Tao mutter to herself for a moment before smiling, “No wonder you would refuse. Since Little Brother Yang has such concerns, this Young Lady won’t say anymore.”</p>
<p>Although she failed to invite Yang Kai to participate in the trial, causing Chen Shi Tao to be slightly disappointed, since he had such a reason, she wouldn’t try to force the issue. After chatting with Yang Kai for a while, she left to return to the small mountain she had occupied a short distance away.</p>
<p>After she left, Yang Kai smiled slightly, seemingly pondering something before turning his eyes and staring at a certain spot up in the sky and calling out lightly, “Did you see something interesting after looking for so long?”</p>
<p>As soon as he spoke these words, a slight aura fluctuation appeared where Yang Kai was looking at, but in the next moment everything became calm once more, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Yang Kai coldly snorted, “What’s wrong? Since Brother Wang has already come, does he want this Yang to offer an invitation before showing up?”</p>
<p>Listening to Yang Kai address him by name, a ripple suddenly appeared in the sky and a figure soon revealed itself. Staring down somberly at Yang Kai, this newly appeared person asked solemnly, “How did you discover me?”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he took back a cloak-like artifact and stared at Yang Kai, quickly adding, “My Concealing Aura Coat is an Origin Grade High-Rank artifact, it’s impossible for someone like you to notice any flaws.”</p>
<p>“An Origin Grade High-Rank artifact!” Yang Kai raised his brow as he grinned slightly, “Brother Wang actually possess such a good artifact. En, but despite this artifact not being low grade, with your strength, it seems you can’t activate it completely, and this Yang has always been quite sensitive to other peoples’ prying eyes, heh heh!”</p>
<p>“Seems you have some skill!” Wang Yu Han snorted coldly, not showing the slightest embarrassment after having been exposed.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t Brother Wang be concentrating on recovering right now? Why stealthily stalk her? If I hadn’t realized it was Brother Wang’s aura nearby, I might just have attacked,” Yang Ka smiled faintly.</p>
<p>“Hmph, my injuries are already healed; moreover, I didn’t come here with any malicious intent, I was simply curious,” Wang Yu Han replied bluntly.</p>
<p>“If it was just curiosity, then I suppose it can’t be helped. If Brother Wang has something he’d like to say to me, you might as well say it directly. If I can do something to alleviate some worry for you, I certainly will. If not... Brother Wang need only be patient for a few more days.”</p>
<p>“Why would I need anything from you?” Wang Yu Han’s complexion suddenly sank as he said meaningfully, “But you rejecting Sister Chen’s proposal was a wise move. Although your strength isn’t too low, it’s still not enough to enter a great force like Clear Sky Sect. If you had made an attempt, it would have only disappointed Sister Chen’s good intentions. At that time, it would certainly be awkward to face her.”</p>
<p>“Such matters are my concern; Brother Wang does not need to trouble himself over them. En, if Brother Wang has nothing else to say, please go back, my companion and I simply wish to use the Space Array in Black Crow City, so we will naturally leave when the time comes.”</p>
<p>“That would be for the best!” Wang Yu Han nodded flatly before cupping his fists and turning to leave.</p>
<p>At that time, Yang Kai suddenly called out, “Right, I should remind you that I dislike being spied upon by others. This time I will let the matter go, but if it were to happen again...”</p>
<p>“You’ll what?” Wang Yu Han turned back to Yang Kai and snorted disdainfully.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled mysteriously as he released a pulse of Spiritual Energy from his Knowledge Sea to envelope Wang Yu Han.</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han’s face changed greatly as at that moment, he felt the aura of death sudden descend upon him. Just as he was about to fight back though, he discovered that the ominous feeling had disappeared. Meanwhile, Yang Kai was simply standing exactly where he had originally been, looking at him with a smile, as if what just happened had nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han’s expression immediately became suspicious as he felt some cold sweat drip down is back, but after a short silence, he turned his head and flew off into the distance.</p>
<p>“Suddenly treating me like a love rival for no reason, how annoying!” Yang Kai muttered to himself.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had long since realized why Wang Yu Han was constantly opposing him and why he had stealthily snuck over to observe him. However, Yang Kai really had no intentions towards Chen Shi Tao; after leaving Black Crow City this time, they might never even meet again, so Wang Yu Han’s worries were completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai could tell that Wang Yu Han wasn’t a good thing, there was no need for him to remind Chen Shi Tao; after all, he was disinclined to meddle in such troublesome matters. On top of that, Chen Shi Tao was not some naive young girl who didn’t know how the world worked, so there was no need for him to warn her about something she clearly already knew.</p>
<p>For Yang Kai, as long as he could gain access to Black Crow City’s Space Array, he wasn’t interested in intervening in these matters, but Wang Yu Han spying on him in secret had touched Yang Kai’s nerves, so he had given him a small warning. Although the Soul pressure Yang Kai used just now didn’t appear to do any immediate harm to Wang Yu Han, he had actually planted a kind of Divine Sense mark deep in his opponent’s Knowledge Sea. With this seed of fear laid down, in the future, if they really came to blows, all Yang Kai would need to do is trigger it and Wang Yu Han would degenerate into a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>With the current power of Yang Kai’s Divine Sense, pulling this kind of small trick on a Third-Order Saint King was a simple matter, and unless a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm master or someone stronger were to carefully probe Wang Yu Han’s Knowledge Sea, it would be impossible to discover and destroy this Divine Sense seed.</p>
<p>The probability of this happening was minimal though, and Yang Kai wasn’t worried even if it did happen.</p>
<p>After a moment of contemplation, Yang Kai felt that he hadn’t exposed his strength or means a moment ago, so he closed his eyes and nodded with satisfaction before continuing to focus on his own affairs.</p>
<p>Three days later, Chen Fan Lei and the others had finished healing from their wounds and recovering their strength. Yang Yan had also handed a ring-like object to Yang Kai already. This ring had a bitter cold chill about it and one could tell at first glance that cold materials had been used to refine it. Yang Kai even noticed some traces of the Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade’s aura.</p>
<p>Sweeping it with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai found that Sun’s True Essence, which had rendered him helpless to even touch it, was stored inside with multiple layers of barriers surrounding it, gathering Ice Attribute Energy in order to restrain the Sun’s True Fire.</p>
<p>This ring was somewhat similar to a Space Ring, but its capacity was extremely small, only about ten square metres. It was obviously an artifact refined by Yang Yan specifically to store the Sun’s True Essence.</p>
<p>With such a thing, Yang Kai didn’t need to worry about the Sun’s True Essence’s aura being exposed and he could easily transport it from place to place. After investigating this ring slightly, Yang Kai put it away while liberally praising Yang Yan’s skills, declaring that she was unparalleled under the Heavens.</p>
<p>Of course, Yang Yan only shot Yang Kai a disdainful look.</p>
<p>Finished with what they needed to do here, Yang Kai and Yang Yan met up with Chen Shi Tao’s group and learned that they too were ready to depart.</p>
<p>After a brief discussion, the group of six set out for Black Crow City. On the way, Wang Yu Han’s former incessant chatter gave way to silence and he also seemed to intentionally or unintentionally distance himself from Yang Kai, often shooting him strange looks.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao and the others seemed to not notice this change and instead busied themselves telling Yang Kai in detail about the situation of Black Crow City.</p>
<p>Through their explanations, Yang Kai learned that because the geographical location of Black Crow City was a bit special, it didn’t fall under the jurisdiction of any single great force. Three mid-sized forces, Extreme Path Sect, Imperial City Sect, and Honoured Oath Pavilion, all had their headquarters roughly the same distance from Black Crow City, and as a result had competed with each other for many years and lost many disciples to gain control over it. However, in the end, no single Sect was able to triumph over the others.</p>
<p>In the end, the three Sects came to some kind of agreement where all of them swore not to interfere with Black Crow City any further.</p>
<p>After this agreement was reached, Black Crow City itself began to rise in strength, with its City Lord recruiting a number of powerful cultivators to guard and protect it. With the help of some nearby mineral lodes, over time, Black Crow City managed to survive even though it was caught between these three Sects.</p>
<p>There were actually many cities like Black Crow City on Shadowed Star, most of them achieving a degree of independence because the local Sects were unable to agree on who would take ownership of it. As a result, these cities would often grow into sizeable forces.</p>
<p>This kind of independent city force was very attractive to lone cultivators, and through some solicitation, these cities would occasionally be able to attract some powerful masters to join them.</p>
<p>These cities were generally referred to as Free Cities, and even if there weren’t a thousand of them on Shadowed Star, there were are least eight hundred. Because these Free Cities didn’t have strict constraints like formal Sects, and their management was relatively loose, the City Lord position would often change hands. Essentially, whoever’s fist was biggest would become the City Lord, so although these Free Cities had some strength, they were never able to form large, cohesive forces. As a result, the surrounding Sects wouldn’t pay much mind to these Free Cities, instead maintaining cooperative relationships with them.</p>
<p>However, there were always exceptions. On Shadowed Star, there were a few Free Cities that weren’t inferior in strength to great Sects. Such cities were often controlled by a single, extremely powerful family or governed by several families that were relatively united with each other. Although infighting was unavoidable, it was restrained to an acceptable range, and once outside enemies invaded, they would band together to repel them.</p>
<p>After thousands of years of prosperity, these super cities obtained status and strength no worse than other great forces on Shadowed Star.</p>
<h2>1308</h2>
<p>Chapter 1308, Black Crow City</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>Black Crow City couldn’t be compared to that kind of super city, so even though Chen Fan Lei was only a Saint King Realm disciple of Extreme Path Sect, he has some personal relationships with a Senior responsible for guarding the city’s Space Array. Having once been entrusted by that person with a certain task, that Senior now owed Chen Fan Lei a favour and would have to give him some face. Learning this, Yang Kai calmed down as he understood that gaining access to the Space Array shouldn’t be a problem, unlike back in Demon Blood City.</p>
<p>In general, moving about Shadowed Star was a hassle. Even just being able to use the Space Arrays in each city was a headache.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Yang Kai had good luck and was able to obtain help from others to use these Space Arrays twice.</p>
<p>Yang Kai began wondering if there was some kind of token or pass that would allow him to use any of the Space Arrays on Shadowed Star at will. If there was such a thing, it would undoubtedly make his life more convenient.</p>
<p>Of course, Yang Kai didn’t expect such a convenient item to exist, but after casually mentioning it to Chen Shi Tao, he learned there really was such a thing! This surprised Yang Kai greatly and he hurriedly asked her for more details.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao seemed to know what he was thinking so she freely shared everything she knew.</p>
<p>After listening to Chen Shi Tao’s explanation though, Yang Kai could only smile bitterly and shake his head.</p>
<p>Although this kind of access pass existed, and would be recognized and accepted by about eighty percent of the forces on Shadowed Star, obtaining it was akin to trying to ascend to the Heavens. There were two ways to acquire this pass; the first was to perform some kind of meritorious deed that brought great benefit to all of Shadowed Star. While this condition sounded simple, it was essentially impossible to complete.</p>
<p>There were as many forces on Shadowed Star as there were hairs on an ox, and although many of them would cooperate with each other, there was also no end to the conflicts and struggles between them. Something that was beneficial to one party would undoubtedly be detrimental to another. Trying to accomplish something that improved everyone’s lives was nothing short of a fool’s dream.</p>
<p>The second method was actually much simpler than the first method. One simply needed to receive the joint approval of ten first-class Sects. With that, they could get this free entry pass to all of Shadowed Star’s Space Arrays!</p>
<p>Although this second method was simpler, that was only compared to the first method. There were only about twenty first-class Sects on Shadowed Star, so collecting the support of ten of them was basically impossible.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had a fair amount of contact with Shadow Moon Hall, Clear Sky Sect, and Coloured Glass Sect, which were all first-class Sects, but only famous Elders of such Sects could act as guarantors for the pass.</p>
<p>Either of these methods could be used to obtain the pass Yang Kai wanted, but after listening to Chen Shi Tao, he extinguished such thoughts completely as he couldn’t achieve either of them with his current abilities.</p>
<p>Chatting along the way, time passed quickly and five days later, the group of six arrived at the outskirts of Black Crow City. After paying some Saint Crystals, the guards allowed them through the city gates without incident.</p>
<p>After entering the city, Yang Kai looked around and saw many wide and narrow winding roads, all of them lined with many shops on both sides. Although Black Crow City couldn’t be called crowded with people, it was still quite lively and bustling.</p>
<p>“Little Brother Yang, are you planning to stay here for some time or are you anxious to depart?” Chen Shi Tao suddenly looked back at Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai thought about it for a moment before replying, “If possible, I naturally want to leave here quickly, as there are still some things I have to attend to.”</p>
<p>After acquiring so many materials and Saint Crystals, and with the Stone Puppet having stolen so much Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass, Yang Yan was naturally eager to continue her Artifact Refining, and from what Yang Kai heard from her it seemed she would be refining a truly shocking treasure this time. As for what she was working on specifically, Yang Yan insisted on keeping it a secret, making Yang Kai helpless.</p>
<p>On top of Yang Yan’s desire to return, the fact that the Stone Puppet and Artifact Spirit were currently wounded left Yang Kai unwilling to remain outside. Only after he returned to Dragon Cave Mountain would he be able to provide his two assistants with a safe environment to recuperate.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Chen Shi Tao’s eyes flashed with some disappointment, but she didn’t insist anymore and said, “Since that’s the case, Fan Lei will go to the Space Array now to see if that Senior is in. If everything goes well, before the night falls, Little Brother Yang should be able to leave.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai naturally had no opinion and simply thanked Chen Fan Lei politely before finding a spot out of the way to wait quietly with Chen Shi Tao and the others.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Chen Shi Tao tried to invite Yang Kai to participate in the Clear Sky Sect recruitment trial once more, but Yang Kai still politely refused. Seeing this, Chen Shi Tao chose not to pester him about the issue and instead began chatting with him about other topics with a smile.</p>
<p>After about an hour, Chen Fan Lei returned.</p>
<p>However, the look on his face was a bit awkward, as if he had failed to accomplish the task he had been assigned.</p>
<p>Upon seeing his expression, Yang Kai couldn’t help clenching his fist slightly, secretly wondering whether the other party was unwilling to bend the rules. If this was the case, then he could only choose to take two or three months to fly back to Dragon Cave Mountain from here.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao obviously also had similar speculations and after her little brother arrived, she hurriedly asked, “Fan Lei, did things not go smoothly?”</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei smiled mirthlessly as a guilty look appeared on his face, shaking his head as he said, “Things really didn’t go smoothly.”</p>
<p>“What happened?” Chen Shi Tao asked.</p>
<p>“The Senior I know just happens to be out of the city. From what I heard from the others, it seems he was assigned some kind of task outside the city.”</p>
<p>“He’s out of the city?” Chen Shi Tao stunned, “How could he be out of the city at this exact moment? Could it be they were just trying to deceive you?”</p>
<p>“No, no!” Chen Fan Lei quickly waved his hand, “I found some others to ask about this matter and confirmed that the Senior I know is indeed on a mission. He just left the city a few days ago and it seems the soonest he’ll return is in three days.”</p>
<p>“Three days...” Chen Shi Tao murmured, turning her head to look at Yang Kai and smiling apologetically, “Little Brother Yang, I’m sorry, it seems that things won’t be as easy as I anticipated.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, accidents are bound to happen,” Yang Kai replied faintly.</p>
<p>Seeing that Yang Kai didn’t show a displeased look, Chen Shi Tao calmed down and said, “But that Senior will be back in three days at the soonest, can you wait that long? You may rest assured, as soon as that Senior returns, we will definitely arrange for you to leave here.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a problem, even if I have to wait ten days it’s still fine; after all, it’s better than taking two or three months to fly back by Star Shuttle. But Brother Chen, are you certain that Senior won’t be delayed too long? If he doesn’t return for some time, it may not be worth waiting.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to worry!” Chen Shi Tao smiled brightly, “If that Senior hasn’t returned after three days, we can go to another place, whether it’s Extreme Path Sect’s Gale City or Clear Sky Sect’s Black Sea City, both are only ten to fifteen days from here and both have Space Arrays which are directly connected to Heavenly Fate City. Here we have to rely on my personal connections, but in Gale City or Black Sea City we will have full authority to access the Space Array.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up slightly as the last trace of concern faded from his mind, nodding as he agreed to Chen Shi Tao’s proposal.</p>
<p>Since they had decided to wait for three days here, it was necessary to find a place to stay. Fortunately, there were many inns in Black Crow City, while both Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying were wealthy Young Ladies worth more than a million Saint Crystals each, so the place they chose naturally wasn’t bad.</p>
<p>A short time later, the group of six arrived at a top-level inn called Flying Spirit Palace.</p>
<p>Flying Spirit Palace was a well known establishment in Black Crow City and was among the highest quality lodgings available. Generally, the cultivators who stayed here were either rich or held extremely high status, as a single night would cost three thousand High-Rank Saint Crystals.</p>
<p>This kind of price was quite exorbitant. One had to know that the best rooms at an average inn would only cost hundreds of Saint Crystals a night, making the price of this Flying Spirit Palace over a dozen times higher.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for Yang Kai helping them out twice, one of which could be counted as a life-saving grace, Chen Shi Tao wouldn’t have spent so lavishly. After all, although she had a lot of Saint Crystals now, she had never been one to waste it on frivolous luxuries. This time could only be considered her borrowing Yang Kai’s favour as an excuse to spend somewhat freely.</p>
<p>Although the price was ridiculously high, after seeing their accommodations, everyone felt it was a worthwhile cost.</p>
<p>The reason was simple, every guest staying here was given a separate three-story loft. The first floor was for entertaining guest, the second for meditating, and the third for Alchemy or Artifact Refining.</p>
<p>Each floor was equipped with at least seven or eight different Spirit Arrays that not only shielded against outside Divine Sense intrusions but also provided other types of protection.</p>
<p>On top of that, each loft came with two beautiful young maidservants. These maids were also cultivators, but their cultivations weren’t high, most of them just True Element Boundary or even Separation and Reunion Boundary cultivators; however, all of them had received careful training to greet and entertain guests. Of course, some excessive requests wouldn’t be met.</p>
<p>According to the cultivator who received Chen Shi Tao’s group, Flying Spirit Palace was actually the private industry of the City Lord and several other powerful Elders from the city, so safety was guaranteed as no one would dare come here to make trouble.</p>
<p>The cultivator who welcomed them seemed to unintentionally reveal this news, which was obviously meant as a subtle warning for Yang Kai and the others to not underestimate the background of this inn, or worse, try to stir up trouble themselves.</p>
<p>A group of six people, of course, didn’t need six whole lofts, so Chen Shi Tao only booked three, one she would share with Lu Ying, one that Wang Yu Han and Chen Fan Lei would stay in, and one for Yang Kai and Yang Yan.</p>
<p>After all the arrangements were complete, everyone dispersed to their respective loft.</p>
<p>The loft where Yang Kai and Yang Yan were staying in had an ornate design and a very impactful name, the Floating Snow Moon Pavilion.</p>
<p>Seeing this building, Yang Yan licked her lips happily while Yang Kai held no opinions of it. The two of them quickly chose a room for themselves before sitting in meditation to rest.</p>
<h2>1309</h2>
<p>Chapter 1309, Chen Fan Lei’s Invitation</p>
<p>An uneventful night passed, and the next day Yang Kai and Yang Yan took advantage of this opportunity to wander around Black Crow City; after all, it was their first time here, so they wanted to see if there were any local special products. If they were lucky, they might even find some useful materials.</p>
<p>A day of shopping with Yang Yan yielded some good results as the pair was able to buy some materials and ores that were difficult to come by in Heavenly Fate City.</p>
<p>The price they paid was naturally not a discounted one like when they purchased from Shadow Moon Hall, but inside Grand Burial Valley, Yang Kai and Yang Yan had obtained quite a few Saint Crystals, so naturally, they wouldn’t care about such small expenses.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, Yang Yan had purchased nearly fifty million Saint Crystals worth of Artifact Refining materials.</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai did not object, he was still shocked to witness this. At the rate Yang Yan was spending, the Saint Crystals they harvested this time may not be able to last very long; however, judging from the materials she purchased, Yang Kai vaguely felt that she really wanted to refine something astonishing.</p>
<p>While panicking slightly inside, Yang Kai was also quite looking forward to what the end result would be.</p>
<p>If not for Yang Kai worrying about drawing unwanted attention, Yang Yan would have continued dragging him around, buying up everything she was interested in. Yang Kai had not failed to notice several people paying attention to them already, quite interested in both him and Yang Yan.</p>
<p>This was not a surprise though, as they were clearly just a young man and woman but had spent tens of millions of Saint Crystal in a single day. This would inevitably cause some people to get ideas about them. Fortunately, these people were only curious at the moment and did not make any moves, simply following them around stealthily.</p>
<p>In the evening, Yang Kai and Yang Yan returned to Flying Spirit Palace, but as soon as they entered the Floating Snow Moon Pavilion, Yang Yan went straight to the third floor and secluded herself in the Artifact Refining Room there.</p>
<p>Helpless, Yang Kai went to the second floor to meditate.</p>
<p>After about two hours though, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes and looked outward with a slight frown. Waving his hand, the door was opened silently by a beautiful young girl in a green dress standing outside. She was one of the two maidservants responsible for this Floating Snow Moon Pavilion.</p>
<p>She first greeted Yang Kai elegantly before softly explaining, “Young Lord, you have a guest. Would Young Lord like to meet with them?”</p>
<p>“Who is it?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“He said he was your companion and that his surname was Chen!”</p>
<p>“Chen?” Yang Kai was surprised, pondering for a moment before asking, “Is he by himself?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” The maidservant nodded gently.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s lips curled into a slight smile hearing this and without waiting for the maidservant to ask again, he waved his hand lightly, “I understand, let him wait downstairs for a while, I’ll be down in a moment.”</p>
<p>The maidservant bowed gracefully before turning around and gracefully walking downstairs.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not get up immediately, but instead sat on the spot, his eyes flashing slightly as his thoughts turned. Only after a moment of contemplation did he stand up and walk out.</p>
<p>On the first floor inside the hospitality room, Chen Fan Lei sat with his back straight like a sword, his well-groomed brow and bright eyes highlighting his face. Although he could not be considered incredibly handsome, he seemed to have been born with a heroic temperament, especially his eyes which always seemed to burst with life.</p>
<p>The two maidservants of this Floating Snow Moon Pavilion seemed quite taken with him and would casually sneak glances at his face from time to time, blushing slightly as they did so.</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei had apparently noticed this but pretended not to, instead choosing to sit up straight with a serious look upon his face. However, one did not need to look too closely to notice that he was constantly fidgeting, as if he was sitting on pins and needles.</p>
<p>Sometime later, when Yang Kai finally came down from upstairs, Chen Fan Lei felt as if a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders and quickly got up, cupped his fists, and said, “Brother Yang, I’ve taken the liberty to pay you a visit but it seems I’ve disturbed your cultivation, I hope Brother Yang won’t take offence.”</p>
<p>Hearing him say this, Yang Kai wore a stunned look but soon smiled warmly and said, “Brother Chen is too polite. I was also just filling the time, so you haven’t disturbed me at all.”</p>
<p>Saying so, he ordered the two maidservants to prepare some tea.</p>
<p>The maidservant in green who had gone upstairs to inform Yang Kai of Chen Fan Lei’s arrival nodded and immediately got to work.</p>
<p>Not long after, not only was tea served, put a platter of exquisite spirit fruits was laid out as well.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t know why Chen Fan Lei had suddenly run over to see him, so he didn’t rashly inquire; however, it seemed Chen Fan Lei didn’t want to explain his purpose directly and instead began talking about random things.</p>
<p>But Yang Kai could clearly feel that Chen Fan Lei was acting very different from usual, and for some reason the presence of the two maidservants seemed to be stressing him. Instead of his usually free and unfettered speech, Chen Fan Lei was now picking his words carefully, even speaking somewhat incoherently at times.</p>
<p>Whenever he would trip over his words, the two maidservants would let out a light giggle, embarrassing Chen Fan Lei even further.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai seemed to understand something and lightly instructed the two maidservants, “There’s no need for you to remain here, you may go back and rest. I will call for you if I require your service.”</p>
<p>The two maidservants glanced at each other and, although they were a little disappointed, politely nodded before reluctantly departing, both secretly casting Chen Fan Lei a sincere glance before they left.</p>
<p>Yang Kai saw this and laughed dumbly despite trying not to.</p>
<p>After the two maidservants left and Chen Fan Lei and Yang Kai were alone, the former was obviously relieved, and his usual demeanour was instantly restored. No longer embarrassed or anxious, he began chatting freely with Yang Kai, sometimes laughing joyfully while at other times acting quite seriously as he argued over different topics related to cultivation that he disagreed with Yang Kai over.</p>
<p>This chat lasted for two hours, but even then, Chen Fan Lei showed no signs of saying goodbye or revealing his true intentions, so Yang Kai had no choice but to raise the subject.</p>
<p>[He couldn’t have forgotten why he came here, right?]</p>
<p>At this point, Yang Kai lightly coughed and asked, “Does Brother Chen have some specific purpose for coming to see me this time?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Chen Fan Lei showed a stunned expression before immediately smacking his forehead.</p>
<p>[He really had forgotten!]</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai smiled bitterly but remained silent, waiting for him to speak.</p>
<p>“Actually, it’s nothing important, it’s just that Brother Yang rescued us twice in Grand Burial Valley, but after arriving here in Black Crow City, I’ve barely been able to reciprocate the favour, so I thought I should try to entertain Brother Yang.”</p>
<p>“Entertain?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Chen Fan Lei nodded repeatedly, “I’ve heard there is a very interesting place in Black Crow City. This Chen has long been curious about it but has never had an opportunity to patronize it, but now that we are in this situation, I thought I’d invite Brother Yang to accompany me. I wonder if Brother Yang is interested?”</p>
<p>“An interesting place?” Yang Kai suddenly became curious, “What kind of place is it?”</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei’s face suddenly showed a hint of embarrassment, but that soon disappeared and with a meaningful grin, he said, “Allow this Chen to keep that a secret for now. When we arrive, Brother Yang will naturally understand.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai looked at him with a smile and pondered for a while before nodding, “Sure, since Brother Chen has come to invite me, then I will accompany you. Should we also call Sister Chen and the others?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not!” Chen Fan Lei’s complexion changed as he waved his hands frantically, “This matter can never be known by her, otherwise she’ll skin me alive! I wouldn’t have come to visit so late at night if it weren’t specifically to avoid her noticing.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Yang Kai’s thoughts flashed, suddenly guessing what kind of place Chen Fan Lei wanted to go to, but after thinking about it for a moment, he asked, “What about Brother Wang?”</p>
<p>“Senior Brother Wang, he went out during the day and said that he was visiting one of his family Elders here. I do not know when he will return. We don’t have to wait for him.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently nodded, “Since that’s the case, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei saw Yang Kai agree and his spirits lifted, immediately nodding before leading the way.</p>
<p>Together, the pair left Flying Spirit Palace and quickly blended into the crowds of Black Crow City.</p>
<p>At night, Black Crow City seemed livelier than during the day as even more cultivators were now coming and going. Chen Fan Lei had apparently made preparations before, so he quickly led Yang Kai down a series of roads with great familiarity.</p>
<p>Soon, the pair arrived at a seemingly inconspicuous mansion. At the door of this establishment were two Saint Realm cultivators in black armour holding spears, their eyes coldly glancing around their surroundings.</p>
<p>At first glance, there was nothing special about this place, and it truly seemed to be an ordinary mansion, but when Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to investigate it, he was surprised to find that many barriers had been arranged here and he was actually unable to learn anything about its internal situation.</p>
<p>However, from time to time, some cultivators would swaggeringly enter this building. These cultivators had uneven cultivations, but regardless of their strength, the two guard-like cultivators at the door turned a blind eye to them, without even asking any questions.</p>
<p>This inevitably aroused Yang Kai’s curiosity as he wondered what exactly this place was for it to be so lively.</p>
<p>After arriving here, Chen Fan Lei did not proceed any further, his eyes staring at this mansion seriously, but also with a faint feeling of excitement. Yang Kai clearly noticed that Chen Fan Lei’s temperature had risen slightly, and his pulse had become faster.</p>
<p>Casting him a suspicious glance, Chen Fan Lei simply smiled back at Yang Kai and said, “This is the place, let’s go inside.”</p>
<p>Saying so, just like the cultivators who had entered previously, the two of them walked right inside, the two guards out front not trying to block or interrogate them in the slightest.</p>
<p>Upon entering the mansion and crossing a short black stone path, then turning a few corners, the pair were suddenly greeted by a very lively scene with a strong fragrance of wine and women lingering in the air. Bursts of crisp and sweet laughter echoed about as a wondrous melody played in the background.</p>
<p>There was actually an earthly paradise inside this place!</p>
<p>Yang Kai looked around in amazement and quickly saw an open-air courtyard with countless banquet tables where guests where constantly coming and going while drinking and celebrating. Most notably though was that on the arms of each of these guests were charming young women who were clearly flattering and flirting with them. These women all had different styles and temperaments, and they were all dressed quite diversely as well, some wearing tight-fitting highly exposing dresses while others were dressed up as noble young ladies, but without exception, all of them were great beauties.</p>

<p>Chapter 1310, Joyous Union Pavilion</p>

<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>This scene stunned Yang Kai as he realized that the ‘interesting place,’ Chen Fan Lei wanted to bring himself was just as he had guessed.</p>
<p>This was clearly similar to the brothels in cities where ordinary mortals lived!</p>
<p>However, this place was countless times bigger than an average brothel, because the people who came and went from here were all cultivators, and the women who accompanied them were also cultivators. At the very least, when Yang Kai used his Divine Sense to sweep the crowd in front of him, he found no one with a cultivation lower than the True Element Boundary. The women, however, did not have very high strength, the strongest being just Immortal Ascension Boundary Third or Fourth Stage.</p>
<p>While it was slightly different for the male guests, no one had a cultivation higher than the Saint Realm, which was only slightly higher than the cultivations of the women accompanying them.</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei being interested in this kind of place surprised Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Turning his head and glancing at him, Yang Kai could not help feeling dumbstruck once again.</p>
<p>The current Chen Fan Lei seemed like he had lost his soul, his jaw dropped as he stared at the exaggerated scene in front of him, the mere visual impact apparently having been enough to make him lose the ability to think or act. On top of that, his face was now a bright shade of crimson.</p>
<p>Yang Kai shook his head wryly and was just about to wake him up when a young woman suddenly walked over to them. This woman wore a gorgeous formal dress and had a face the colour of peach blossoms. Her beautiful eyes shimmer like stars and her twin peaks were rich and full, contrasting greatly with her slim, graceful waist and long slender legs. Arriving in front of the two young men, this young woman bowed elegantly and spoke, “This Mistress greets two Young Lords.”</p>
<p>After she spoke, she glanced over at Chen Fan Lei lightly, covered her mouth with her hand and tittered sweetly.</p>
<p>However, it was obviously not the first time she had witnessed such a reaction so she didn’t pay him much mind, instead quickly continuing, “Two Young Lords look unfamiliar, could it be this is your first time visiting our Joyous Union Pavilion?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai shot a glance over at Chen Fan Lei and saw that he was still in a daze. Sighing slightly as he realized he couldn’t expect anything from him for a while, Yang Kai gently nodded and replied, “Yeah, we are indeed the first time patrons, but we have long heard rumours of your famous establishment, so as we were passing through Black Crow City, we specially came here to see it for ourselves.”</p>
<p>“So that’s how it is,” The young woman heard these words and nodded lightly, brushing her hair behind her ear in what seemed to be an unintentionally flirtatious manner before smiling and saying, “I hope we have not disappointed two Young Lords’ expectations. If you are satisfied, would you like this Mistress to arrange a private room for you?”</p>
<p>She could tell that Yang Kai and Chen Fan Lei had strong cultivations and knew they would not be content to simply remain in this open square, so she took the initiative to make such a proposal.</p>
<p>Of course, Yang Kai had no objections, nodded, and allowed her to make appropriate arrangements.</p>
<p>The young woman responded with a nod and quickly led the two through the square and into an exquisite loft a slight distance away.</p>
<p>At the same time, in a chamber deep inside the Joyous Union Pavilion, an old man and a young man sat cross-legged across from each other. The old man had a First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation while the young man was a Third-Order Saint King.</p>
<p>The old man sat calmly as he quietly circulated his Secret Art, not showing the slightest signs of anxiousness; however, the well-dressed young man seemed to be distracted and would frown from time to time, looking outside.</p>
<p>“Yu Han, you need to temper your heart and mind again,” The old man’s eyes did not open but he still spoke authoritatively.</p>
<p>The youth opposite him trembled slightly and showed a look of embarrassment on his face, respectfully nodding as he said, “What Seventh Grandfather said is correct, Yu Han is still too immature.”</p>
<p>The old man smiled slightly and opened his eyes to look at the youth opposite him, “You don’t have to rebuke yourself too harshly; after all, this matter is related to your future, naturally you should act careful about it. Although our Wang Family is not a small family, it is not a big one either. In the current younger generation, you are the most talented and the only one able to join Extreme Path Sect. Now that you have cultivated to the Third-Order Saint King Realm, as long as you have enough opportunity, breaking through to the Origin Returning threshold is not impossible. When that time comes, you and I will be the pillars of our Wang Family. Additionally, your background is also much better than this old master’s, so you will probably be able to go further than this old master in the future.”</p>
<p>“Seventh Grandfather thinks too highly of me. Yu Han was only able to have his current achievements thanks to the family’s great blessings. If I can rise up in the future, I certainly will not bring shame to our Wang Family.”</p>
<p>“Hearing you say so makes me feel reassured. If it were not you but some other clansman who asked this old master for such a favour, I would have immediately refused. Although I was able to become a manger of this Joyous Union Pavilion, you should also know that this place is secretly supported by Imperial City Sect and has the backing of the City Lord. If some kind of accident were to happen here, the consequences would not be something my Wang Family could afford.”</p>
<p>“Yu Han understands, but this time the one I need to deal with is just a Second-Order Saint King and there is no need to confront him directly, just tarnishing his reputation will be enough. There should be no problem.”</p>
<p>“If not for this, how could I have agreed to your request?” The old man snorted before shifting the topic with a chuckle, “Does that woman you fancy truly come from a big force like Clear Sky Sect?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” The youth opposite him nodded as his spirit seemed to rise, immediately following up, “Not only does she come from Clear Sky Sect, she also has extremely high status and possesses a great amount of wealth. At least a million Saint Crystals!”</p>
<p>“A million?” The old man was truly surprised, and a hint of greed flashed across his eyes, “She is just a trivial Third-Order Saint King, how can she possess such wealth?”</p>
<p>“Her luck was incredibly good. When she entered the Flowing Flame Sand Field, she discovered an underground Saint Crystal lode where she spent five months collecting several tens of millions of Saint Crystals. After returning to Clear Sky Sect, most of those were handed over to the Sect, but she was still allowed to keep a portion of them.”</p>
<p>“I see!” The old man’s doubts were cleared instantly, and he nodded, “If that’s the case, then you absolutely cannot let go of her easily. You must do whatever it takes to win over that woman; as long as you can obtain her heart, your future cultivation path will be smooth and you will never need to worry about having enough resources.”</p>
<p>“Yu Han also thinks so, otherwise I would not have had to deal with that little brat surnamed Yang. I know that little brat also has his eyes on Sister Chen, but as long as I can expose him coming to this place, Sister Chen will definitely disdain to see him again.”</p>
<p>“This method is truly good, but are you certain he will come here?” The old man asked again.</p>
<p>The young man smiled and declared, “I cannot say I am absolutely certain, but I am at least eighty percent confident.”</p>
<p>“Let me hear the details then...” The old man asked with interest.</p>
<p>The young man proceeded to explain his scheme, with the old man nodding from time to time, showing his approval.</p>
<p>A moment later, a soft voice suddenly came from outside and the old man’s eyes flashed. After listening to this message, the old man muttered, “They’ve come.”</p>
<p>“Really?” The young man asked joyfully.</p>
<p>“Yes!” The old man looked at the young man with a smile and tossed him something, “Your plan is sound. You can now carry out the next step. You can handle this yourself. This is my manager token. So long as you have it, others here will cooperate with you for most minor matters. “</p>
<p>The young man caught the token and quickly bowed, “Many thanks, Seventh Grandfather!”</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>In a separate lost inside Joyous Union Pavilion, Yang Kai and Chen Fan Lei had sat down casually while the young woman who had led them here had taken her leave. There was no one else inside this building except Yang Kai and Chen Fan Lei.</p>
<p>There was a pot of spirit tea set on the table, and while Yang Kai didn’t drink a drop, Chen Fan Lei had already poured himself several cups, seemingly wanting to use this spirit tea to extinguish the flames in his body.</p>
<p>While he was drinking this tea, Yang Kai just observed him with a smile.</p>
<p>After a while, Yang Kai suddenly said, “Brother Chen, could this be your first time visiting this kind of place?”</p>
<p>“En...” Chen Fan Lei nodded with a deep look of embarrassment on his face, a moment later suddenly looking up at Yang Kai and asking, “Looking at Brother Yang’s relaxed expression, could it be you’re very experienced with this type of thing?”</p>
<p>“Nonsense!” Yang Kai put on a serious face, “This is also my first time visiting such a place.”</p>
<p>“Haha...” Chen Fan Lei let out a dry laugh, not knowing whether to believe Yang Kai or not.</p>
<p>Yang Kai suddenly stared at Chen Fan Lei solemnly, “Brother Chen should not have wanted to visit this place for no reason. You do not seem like the type who indulges in these kinds of activities. Do you have a specific objective for coming here tonight? Could you explain to me?”</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei smiled bitterly, “Did Brother Yang see through me?”</p>
<p>“I was simply speculating,” Yang Kai said in a non-committal tone.</p>
<p>“Since that’s the case, this Chen won’t try to act mysterious,” Chen Fan Lei took a breath and calmed himself down greatly before explaining, “Does Brother Yang believe this place is purely for seeking entertainment and pleasure?”</p>
<p>“It’s not?” Yang Kai raised his brow.</p>
<p>“Naturally, it isn’t. If it was just about seeking pleasure, there are plenty of other places to do so in Black Crow City, there’s no need to specifically come here,” Chen Fan Lei said while quickly regaining his normal condition; after all, he was still a Saint King Realm cultivator so he had at least that much mental discipline.</p>
<p>“Oh? Is there something special here that can attract Brother Chen’s attention?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Actually, this is an open secret. Anyone who visits Joyous Union Pavilion should have the same purpose as I. Although there is also a pure entertainment and pleasure seeking business here, there are also a number of specially cultivated women here who had trained in a special Dual Cultivation Technique that is said to be quite helpful for males hoping to break through bottlenecks!”</p>
<p>“A Dual Cultivation Technique used to break through bottlenecks?” Yang Kai’s eyes flashed as immediately understood what Chen Fan Lei wanted to do here.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Chen Fan Lei nodded lightly, “Last time I was going to take advantage of the Thunder Pond to break through my bottleneck, but unfortunately I was disturbed by that Silver Night Thunder Beast which resulted in my attempt failing. However, I was still able to soak in the Thunder Pond for several days and I can tell that I am just half a step away from breaking through. If I were to rely only on my own hard work, I don’t know how long it will take me to succeed, so I decided to take a chance here. If my luck is good, I will be able to save a lot of time, effort, and pills, and even if I wind up unlucky, it won’t cause any harm and I can simply return to the Sect and continue practicing.”</p>
<p>“So that’s it,” Yang Kai suddenly realized why when Chen Fan Lei first came to his loft and was being observed by those two maidservants he had seemingly felt intense stress. Originally, he wanted to come to this kind of place to try to break through his bottleneck.</p>
<p>“Did Brother Chen learn about this method on his own?” Yang Kai asked seemingly casually.</p>
<p>“No, it was actually Senior Brother Wang who told me about this secret place in Black Crow City when I was discussing with him about how to break through my bottleneck earlier today. I was hoping to come together with Senior Brother Wang but unfortunately he went out and didn’t inform me when he would return, so I could only ask Brother Yang to accompany me as I was too embarrassed to come by myself. I hope Brother Yang won’t blame me,” Chen Fan Lei said apologetically.</p>

<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>Listening to his explanation, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed and he let out a slight chuckle, “Brother Chen asking me to accompany him was out of goodwill, so how could I blame you? Truth be told, I’m also quite interested in this place now.”</p>
<p>“Brother Yang, you...” Chen Fan Lei looked at him in amazement.</p>
<p>Yang Kai grinned, “Brother Chen misunderstands. I am simply interested in this special Dual Cultivation Technique which can help break through bottlenecks. If it turns out to be real, then this Dual Cultivation Technique must be quite amazing. You should know that one of the biggest problem’s we cultivators face is overcoming bottlenecks. Often, a single bottleneck can halt our progress for a lifetime. If this Dual Cultivation Technique is that good, it should be enough to become the core foundation of a great Sect. There would be no need to open this Joyous Union Pavilion in the first place.”</p>
<p>“What Brother Yang means is...” Although Chen Fan Lei was not one for plots of schemes, it didn’t mean he was stupid, so he was able to pick up some clues from what Yang Kai had just said.</p>
<p>“Does this Dual Cultivation Technique used to break through bottlenecks have some kind of hidden danger to it?” Yang Kai looked became serious.</p>
<p>“I don’t know about this, I only heard about this place briefly from Senior Brother Wang and he didn’t mention any risks,” Chen Fan Lei could not help frowning. With Yang Kai’s reminder, he suddenly became vigilant and, after thinking about it for a moment, Chen Fan Lei felt these concerns were reasonable. Wasn’t a Dual Cultivation Technique specifically used to break through bottlenecks a bit too convenient?</p>
<p>“I don’t know if Brother Chen has come into contact with any Dual Cultivation Techniques before, but most of them are actually extremely cruel, gathering Yin to supplement Yang, or gathering Yang to supplement Yin, resulting in one partner benefitting at the other’s expense. Since this Joyous Union Pavilion continues to exist to this day, obviously theses women do not cultivate a gathering Yang to supplement Yin Secret Art, but instead sacrifice their Primordial Yin or foundation to help guests who come here improve their cultivation and break through bottlenecks,” Yang Kai pondered out loud as he began mentioning the characteristics of Dual Cultivation Techniques. In fact, he did not need to say such words as Chen Fan Lei should have heard them before; after all, he wasn’t an inexperienced youth unfamiliar with how the cultivation world worked. Even if he had never seen or read a Dual Cultivation Technique before, he should have at least heard some rumours about them.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had cultivated a very profound Dual Cultivation Technique, so he had the qualification to speak about them.</p>
<p>“If this is the case, there really might be some hidden dangers! After all, if I don’t have a special Secret Art to refine the Primordial Yin or Yuan Qi from others, even if my cultivation increases somewhat and I am able to break through my bottleneck, it will cause my foundation to become unsteady,” Chen Fan Lei said thoughtfully, quickly muttering, “But since it’s like this, why would Senior Brother Wang specifically mention such a place to me? If it were not for him suddenly needing to go out, I even thought he would be the one to bring me here.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps Brother Wang had just mentioned it unintentionally and you misunderstood his intent?” Yang Kai said casually.</p>
<p>“I see!” Chen Fan Lei gently nodded, “That might be the case. En, since there are such hidden dangers with this method, I cannot go through with it anymore. I’d rather spend more time in meditation than ruin my foundation by trying to Dual Cultivate with some woman I don’t know.”</p>
<p>After realizing this, Chen Fan Lei finally restored his usual cleverness and said while standing up, “Brother Yang, let’s go now.”</p>
<p>“Since we’ve already arrived, there’s no need to rush off. If we were to suddenly leave like this, we might even offend this place’s owners,” Yang Kai laughed dumbly.</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei scratched his head as a look of helplessness appeared on his face. If he had known things would turn out like this, he would not have dragged Yang Kai along with him to this place. Now even leaving had become somewhat troublesome.</p>
<p>“Could it be that we are really going to... have to...” Chen Fan Lei looked at Yang Kai with a mixture of uncertainty and anticipation.</p>
<p>Yang Kai laughed, “That depends on Brother Chen’s intentions. Of course, we should avoid any dual cultivation, but if it’s simply having some fun, it shouldn’t matter too much.”</p>
<p>“Brother Yang must be joking,” Chen Fan Lei blushed brightly.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yang Kai expression suddenly changed as he turned his head to look at the door. A soft knocking soon echoed as the young woman who had led them here earlier softly called out, “Two Young Lords, this Mistress has kept you waiting.”</p>
<p>Saying so, she pushed open the door and walked inside followed by two maidservants, one of whom held a scented wine jug while the other carried a platter of exquisite spirit fruits. After bowing gracefully, the two maids walked up and placed the refreshments onto a small table before bowing and retreating to stand behind the lead young woman.</p>
<p>The young woman then took a seat across from Yang Kai and Chen Fan Lei before asking, “I wonder if the two Young Lords are here to seek pleasure or if they have some special requests?”</p>
<p>“What is the difference between seeking pleasure and special requests?” Yang Kai raised his brow as he asked in a calm and experienced tone, making the young woman not dare to look down on him.</p>
<p>The young woman smiled as her lashes fluttered, exuding a kind of intoxicating charm. Turning her eyes to meet Chen Fan Lei’s, she began explaining, “If two Young Lords simply wish to seek pleasure, there are many Young Ladies with excellent aptitudes and appearances you may freely choose from at our Joyous Union Pavilion. Regardless of cultivation or beauty, our girls are far superior to other places in Black Crow City. Of course, our prices are also not comparable to those places either.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled slightly, “Price is not an issue, as long as you can satisfy us, but I wonder, what is the highest cultivation of the girls in your establishment?”</p>
<p>The young woman smiled lightly, “It seems Young Lord’s vision is quite high. If we are speaking of the girl with the highest cultivation, that would be Hong Yue, she is a Second-Order Saint King!”</p>
<p>“A Second-Order Saint King!” Yang Kai was genuinely stunned and when he looked at Chen Fan Lei, he saw that the other party was also wearing a shocked expression. The two of them had not expected that such a woman would actually exist here; after all, with such a cultivation, it would be easy for her to join some big Sect and obtain far better conditions than in this place.</p>
<p>The young woman continued, “But Lady Hong Yue only acts personally twice a year; after that, no matter the price, she won’t see any guests. On top of that, whether she is willing to attend to a guest is completely up to her, so even if Young Lord offers an incredible price, it may be useless.”</p>
<p>“This Lady Hong Yue seems to have quite an interesting temperament. En, never mind,” Yang Kai waved his hand, “Such troubles are best avoided.”</p>
<p>“Very well,” The young woman seemed relieved upon hearing this and quickly asked, “May I ask if two Young Lords have some other special requests?”</p>
<p>“I heard that your noble establishment has a group of women who specifically cultivate a special Dual Cultivation Technique which is useful for breaking through bottlenecks. Is this true?” Yang Kai asked while looking straight at her.</p>
<p>The young woman gently nodded, “En, we do have such a group of women at Joyous Union Pavilion. Moreover, as long as they are Saint King Realm guests, eight out of ten come here because of this. It seems the same is true for two Young Lords.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, in our recent cultivation, we have indeed encountered some bottlenecks that we are unable to break through, so we came here to inquire about your services.”</p>
<p>“If that is the case, then it is easy to handle. If you do not mind, how about you allow this Mistress to make the appropriate arrangements. I guarantee two Young Lords will be satisfied,” The young woman asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“Sounds good.” Yang Kai gently nodded.</p>
<p>The young woman slowly stood up and walked out to make preparations, but just as she reached the door, she suddenly turned back and said, “Right, two Young Lords, this Mistress must forewarn you, although many guests who visit our establishment use this special Dual Cultivation session to successfully break through their bottlenecks, not everyone can succeed. If the two Young Lords happen to fail to achieve their wishes...”</p>
<p>“Naturally, we understand this, you may rest assured. If we cannot achieve our objectives, it will simply mean our fortune isn’t good enough and we will not hold you responsible.”</p>
<p>The young woman nodded with satisfaction and this time really left.</p>
<p>After she left, Chen Fan Lei looked at Yang Kai suspiciously, wondering why he had specifically asked about the women who cultivated the special Dual Cultivation Technique. However, Yang Kai did not show any intention to explain himself, so Chen Fan Lei could only puzzle over it on his own. Steeling himself, Chen Fan Lei swore to treat this as a simple new experience; if he didn’t actually engage in any dual cultivation, everything should be fine. Relaxing somewhat, he began helping himself to the spirit fruits on the table.</p>
<p>After a while, the young woman returned once again but this time there were more than a dozen beautiful young women accompanying her. The women all had truly outstanding appearances and astonishing figures, but what was most impressive was that all of them were First-Order Saints. This kind of cultivation was much higher than the women Yang Kai and Chen Fan Lei had seen outside earlier.</p>
<p>As these dozen or so women entered the private room, a floral fragrance filled the air, adding to the enchanting atmosphere.</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei both eyes both glowed as he examined each of these beauties with great enthusiasm, while on the other hand, Yang Kai remained completely indifferent.</p>
<p>The young woman was carefully observing the two of them and although a trace of surprise flashed across her eyes upon seeing Yang Kai’s lack of reaction, she did not say anything and instead just clapped her hands gently.</p>
<p>The group of women who came in left as swiftly as they had come and were replaced by a different group a moment later.</p>
<p>This second batch of women had slightly higher cultivations, each of them a genuine Second-Order Saint.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai remained indifferent.</p>
<p>The lead young woman was even more surprised now, her brow furrowing slightly as she clapped her hands once more, sending out the second batch of women and replacing them with a third.</p>
<p>“Two Young Lords, are you not satisfied?” After waiting for a while, she saw that Yang Kai still did not show any interest and her pretty face couldn’t help sinking slightly, her voice going cold. This group of women was the highest quality group Joyous Union Pavilion ordinarily had to offer, each of them a Third-Order Saint Realm cultivator. One of these two young men seemed quite interested right from the start, but the other showed next to no reaction, making the lead young woman wonder if he was deliberately trying to cause trouble.</p>
<p>Yang Kai just flashed a light smile though as he ignored the cold eyes staring at him and calmly asked, “Could it be that your noble establishment can only offer this level of service? If so, it would be too disappointing.”</p>
<p>The young woman heard this and snorted, waving her hand to dismiss this third group of women as she clenched her teeth and shot back, “This Young Lord’s vision is truly extraordinary. Joyous Union Pavilion indeed has higher quality girls, but there are very few of them and each one of them is extremely expensive, I wonder if the two Young Lords will be able to afford them.”</p>

<p>“As I said, price is no issue, as long as you can satisfy us,” Yang Kai smiled slightly as he tossed a Space Ring over to the young woman.</p>
<p>The young woman caught this ring and promptly swept its contents with her Divine Sense. After seeing the number of Saint Crystals inside, her beautiful face changed slightly and in the next moment, she smiled brightly, all of her previous annoyance thrown beyond the highest Heavens as she said charmingly, “This Young Lord is a man of great spirit! Since that is the case, this Mistress won’t dare disappoint.”</p>
<p>Saying so, she flipped her delicate little hand, causing the Space Ring to disappear. Judging from her expression, she was obviously very satisfied with the price Yang Kai offered and with a flick of her wrist, she sent out a ray of silver light towards him.</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned, but did not take any precautions, simply putting his hand out and catching this silver streak. Upon closer investigation, he found that what he caught was a set of extremely thin silver mirrors.</p>
<p>On each of these mirrors’ surfaces a beautiful woman. These women showed various expressions and poses, some of them aloof while others smiling, some of them stood while others sat. These images were incredibly lifelike, as if real people had been sealed inside these mirrors, eliciting great excitement from any man who saw them.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai soon discovered that the figures on these thin silver mirrors only made a few simple actions before repeating the sequence from the start.</p>
<p>“These girls are the signature specials of our Joyous Union Pavilion. Each one of them still retains their purity and possesses a First-Order Saint King Realm cultivation. If not for Young Lord bringing out so many Saint Crystals at once, this Mistress would not have been able to take responsibility for introducing them. I believe they should satisfy the requirements of two Young Lords, but if not, then this Mistress can only express her deepest regrets.”</p>
<p>“First-Order Saint Kings!” Yang Kai gently nodded but his expression remained faint, not betraying any of his thoughts as he checked through the silver mirrors one by one</p>
<p>The number silver mirrors were indeed not high, only eight in total, but each of these mirrors seemed to be quite a special artifact. Each one was capable of recording several lifelike pictures that perfectly showed off the graceful style and features of these women.</p>
<p>If Yang Kai had simply been seeking pleasure here, each of these beauties would have met his requirements, but he knew that Chen Fan Lei had come here because of Wang Yu Han ‘unintentionally’ mentioning it, so Yang Kai knew there was something afoot.</p>
<p>By now, how could Yang Kai not have understood that Wang Yu Han had malicious intentions towards him? It was just that the schemer’s method this time was clever, allowing him to achieve his objective without acting overtly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was currently stalling for time, deliberately making things difficult because he wanted to see what Wang Yu Han was up to.</p>
<p>He did not really want to have fun here, so after quickly checking through each of these silver mirrors, he would shake his hand and toss them over to Chen Fan Lei who was currently staring dumbly at him.</p>
<p>After browsing through four of these mirrors, Yang Kai still wore a look of indifference, causing the young woman to feel a little uneasy, but remembering how the other party had paid so much Saint Crystals in advance, she didn’t lose her temper like before and simply decided to quietly wait.</p>
<p>When Yang Kai reached the fifth silver mirror, he planned on just taking a casually glance like before, but in the next instant, his complexion changed greatly as a sharp light flashed across his eyes, even his aura suddenly became unstable as he stared at the beautiful figure presented on the silver mirror in his hand.</p>
<p>The young woman who had been closely observing Yang Kai’s expressions naturally did not miss this change and giggled lightly, “Has Young Lord found a beauty that suits his fancy?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai lifted his gaze as a complex light flashed across his eyes, something that surprised the young woman somewhat, but a moment later, that slight awkwardness disappeared and Yang Kai smiled widely, “En, I have indeed. This woman suits my requirements so perfectly I was taken aback for a moment, causing me to embarrass myself slightly.”</p>
<p>Saying so, Yang Kai tossed the silver mirror he was looking at back.</p>
<p>The young woman caught this mirror and looked at the figure displayed on it, murmuring lightly, “So it’s her. En, Young Lord having a liking for her shows you have exquisite taste.”</p>
<p>“Would it be possible to learn this girl’s name?” Yang Kai seemed to ask casually.</p>
<p>The young woman giggled as she covered her mouth, “Please don’t blame me, Young Lord, it is not that this Mistress doesn’t want to tell you, it’s just that Joyous Union Pavilion has a rule that forbids our girls true names from being disclosed. However, Young Lord You may call her Yue’er!”</p>
<p>“Yue’er!” Yang Kai’s eyes flashed strangely once more before he gently nodded and asked, “Then may I know what attribute the Secret Art she cultivates is?”</p>
<p>This time the young woman frowned and hesitantly said, “Is there a reason Young Lord wishes to know this?”</p>
<p>“Please don’t misunderstand, it’s just that since I’ve come here to take advantage of your special Dual Cultivation Technique to break through my bottleneck, I naturally wish to know what the attribute of my partner’s Secret Art is, otherwise, if there is some kind of conflict with mine, wouldn’t it cause some complications for me?”</p>
<p>“En, Young Lord seems to be quite a cautious person, your concern is indeed reasonable,” The young woman heard this and nodded, not giving any hint as to whether she believed him or not as she smiled and replied, “In that case, informing Young Lord is not an issue. Yue’er’s original Secret Art was of the Ice Attribute, but there is no need to worry about conflicts occurring with Young Lord when you engage in dual cultivation because our establishment’s Dual Cultivation Technique does not draw on any kind of attribute. No matter what attribute of Secret Art Young Lord cultivates, there will be no incompatibility. If there were really such worries, this Mistress would naturally have informed Young Lord in advance. “</p>
<p>“I see!” Yang Kai took a deep breath, as if he had just made a big decision, and nodded firmly, “Good, then I’ll choose her.”</p>
<p>“Understood,” The young woman saw Yang Kai make up his mind and quickly clapped her hands. Immediately after, a maidservant walked into the room and the young woman instructed her, “Take this Young Lord to the Snow and Ice Pavilion!”</p>
<p>The maidservant nodded obediently before leading the way.</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced over at Chen Fan Lei and grinned, “Brother Chen, please help yourself.”</p>
<p>“Eh... ah...en, good good!” Chen Fan Lei nodded repeatedly.</p>
<p>After leaving the private room, Yang Kai followed the maidservant along a long path. As his figure merged into the night, Yang Kai’s face suddenly sank and his body shivered slightly, seemingly unable to suppress the violent swings in his mood.</p>
<p>He had never imagined that after coming to this place he would see a person from Tong Xuan Realm!</p>
<p>How could he not feel shocked?</p>
<p>Originally, he wasn’t certain it was who he thought it was; after all, the world was wide so there were many people who looked similar; but after learning the other party’s name was Yue’er, that she cultivated an Ice Attribute Secret Art, and that she was a First-Order Saint King, Yang Kai immediately determined that this Yue’er was someone he knew.</p>
<p>It had been almost ten years since he stepped into the Star Field and all this time, he had never met anyone he knew from his homeland, but now, the first person he met was not just someone related to him, but was actually living in this kind of amorous establishment.</p>
<p>Most importantly, however, she should have been with Su Yan! Now that she was here though, where was Su Yan? Yang Kai’s heart pounded with uncertainty as a series of chaotic thoughts crossed his mind. It took him quite a while to finally calm his mood and begin chatting with the maidservant, trying to probe for some more information about this woman named Yue’er.</p>
<p>But whether Joyous Union Pavilion had rules against it, or this maidservant’s position was too low for her to know anything, Yang Kai was unable to extract anything of use from her. In the end, the maidservant could only apologize with a guilty look on her face.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yang Kai could only sigh softly and hold his questions until he met Yue’er in person.</p>
<p>Not long after, the two arrived in front of an exquisite pavilion that was constructed from some kind of special material that gave off a faint chill.</p>
<p>Here, the maidservant bowed and said, “Young Lord, please enter. This is where Lady Yue’er spends most of her days in meditation. Since she is here today, she should have already been informed that she had a guest so she should be waiting for Young Lord’s arrival.”</p>
<p>“En,” Yang Kai waved his hand and sent the maidservant away before striding into the small palace.</p>
<p>There was no one on the first floor, but Yang Kai’s Divine Sense had already located a person on the second floor. After realizing that this person’s life aura was indeed the same as the one he knew, Yang Kai no longer hesitated and quickly rushed upstairs.</p>
<p>The series of footsteps sounded like a drum, causing the woman on the second floor to tremble with fear and a dangerous light quickly flashed across her beautiful eyes, but soon, she seemed to remember something that caused her face to darken and a bitter smile to appear on her face. She then sat quietly at a small round table and waited expressionlessly.</p>
<p>A moment later, Yang Kai arrived on the second floor and directly opened the door to enter a snow-white room. Everything in this room could be described as pure, and whether it was the curtains or the bedding, everything was white, and together with the slight chill in the air, it gave the illusion that one had just entered a world of ice and snow.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes landed on the woman sitting nearby and he could tell that she was currently feeling quite uneasy, her head drooping down, not standing up to greet him in any way. A few strands of hair hung down to her chest which gave her an extremely desolate and helpless appearance, eliciting a great sense of pity from any who saw her.</p>
<p>As Yang Kai walked straight towards her, this woman’s tender body trembled slightly, as if she was panicking and a painful expression appeared on her face; however, she remained still without moving.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until Yang Kai arrived right in front of her that she let out a resigned sigh and got up to bow politely, “This mistress greets Honoured Guest. May I ask if Honoured Guest wishes to begin immediately?”</p>
<p>She had apparently been informed about having a patron and she continued to hang her head down from beginning to end, avoiding looking at Yang Kai as if she was afraid of something. Even when she spoke, she shows the slightest intention of making conversation, cutting straight to the point.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not speak as he simply stared at her silently, causing Yue’er to feel quite uncomfortable, as if everything about her was being seen through, causing her to shiver unconsciously.</p>
<p>However, even after quite some time, her guest did not try to take advantage of her at all, causing Yue’er’s brow to wrinkle slightly. Just as she was about to say something more, a sigh rang across from her and a faintly familiar voice sounded in her ear, “Elder Qian Yue, it’s been a long time!”</p>
<h2>1313</h2>
<p>Chapter 1313, Ice Soul Bead</p>
<p>Although it was only a soft greeting, when it reached Elder Qian Yue’s ears, her body shivered greatly as she hurriedly raised her head to stare at Yang Kai in disbelief.</p>
<p>Immediately, a look of surprise and confusion bursts flashed across her beautiful eyes, as if recognizing Yang Kai but unsure if she was just imagining things, her thoughts being thrown into complete chaos for a time.</p>
<p>“What? Could it be Elder Qian Yue doesn’t recognize this Yang?” Yang Kai smiled at her lightly.</p>
<p>“Yang Kai!” Qian Yue called out in shock, covering her mouth with her hands as her eyes trembled violently, “It’s really you!”</p>
<p>“In this place, besides me, who else knows you as Elder Qian Yue?” Yang Kai raised his brow.</p>
<p>Qian Yue’s expression became even more complicated as she stared at Yang Kai fixedly, wanting to laugh, wanting to cry, a deep struggle taking place on her face for quite some time before she was finally able to restore her calm, leaving only a touch of fondness in her eyes, as if she had finally met a family member after being separated from them for a very long time. Taking a light breath, she pats on her abundant bosom in relief and finally offered her own greetings, “I never expected to be able to meet you here.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai grinned, “I also didn’t anticipate such a reunion.”</p>
<p>“Right, sit down so we can talk,” Qian Yue regained her composure and offered him a seat.</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded and sat across from her.</p>
<p>Qian Yue sat down, and as their four eyes met, both of them went silent. Obviously they both had a stomach full of questions, but neither of them immediately began asking them.</p>
<p>Qian Yue’s mood was still a bit unstable and Yang Kai was not much better, as the woman named Yue’er in front of him really turned out to be Elder Qian Yue from Tong Xuan Realm’s Ice Sect!</p>
<p>Yang Kai hadn’t really had much contact with this woman and they could at most be considered unfamiliar acquaintances, but in the past, Qian Yue had helped direct Su Yan’s cultivation and although they weren’t officially Master and Disciple, the relationship they shared was essentially that.</p>
<p>When Meng Wu Ya returned to Tong Xuan Realm with Xia Ning Chang and Su Yan through the Void Corridor belonging to the Central Capital, because he needed to free himself from the Profound Heavenly Seal planted on him by Demon Commander Zhang Yuan, he found it impossible to constantly protect Su Yan, so he had entrusted her to the reclusive Ice Sect.</p>
<p>Later, Yang Kai also arrived in Tong Xuan Realm, and after much searching, he had arrived at the Ice Sect where he met Elder Qian Yue and even fought with her.</p>
<p>At the time, Ice Sect’s entire leadership had been drawn out and, in addition to Qian Yue, Yang Kai vaguely remembered several other Saint Realm Elders. Among them was a person named Qian Hao who was Qian Yue’s older blood-related brother as well as Sect Master Qing Ya, who was a peak Third-Order Saint, one of the top masters who stood at the summit of Tong Xuan Realm’s cultivation world.</p>
<p>Back then, Yang Kai had only been a Transcendent Realm cultivator and had only been able to deal with the several Saint Realm Elders of Ice Sect with the help of his Soul Devouring Insects. In the end, he had forced Sect Master Qing Ya to give way and then spent some time to finally communicate with Su Yan’s Soul, bringing their Yin-Yang Joyous Unification Art to the grand accomplishment stage.</p>
<p>Now, less than two decades later, an Elder-class figure that Yang Kai had needed to look up to was currently a destitute traveller who had lost even the freedom to decide her own fate and had degenerated into a Dual Cultivation tool for paying customers to use for breaking through their cultivation bottlenecks. The myriad twists and turns which had resulted in the current situation really made Yang Kai feel somewhat emotional while the same must be even truer for Elder Qian Yue.</p>
<p>As these thoughts flashed across Yang Kai’s mind, his expression suddenly changed as he put on a smile and asked, “I heard that Lady Yue’er has cultivated an Ice Attribute Secret Art. Did you come here from afar? How did you wind up in this place?”</p>
<p>Qian Yue’s brow furrowed slightly as she stared at Yang Kai suspiciously, but after seeing the unusual look in his eyes, she suddenly understood something and replied lightly, “I indeed once cultivated an Ice Attribute Secret Art, but this matter will not have any detriment to Honoured Guest’s request. As for how I came to this place, it is not something Honoured Guest need concern himself with.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t reveal any signs of discontent and simply smiled lightly, “If that’s the case, then this Yang will not ask any further, I simply thought that before we dual cultivate, some communication would benefit both of us. This Yang would like to have a good discussion with Lady Yue’er to increase our mutual understanding, does Lady Yue’er have any objections?”</p>
<p>“If that is what Honoured Guest requests, this Mistress will naturally cooperate,” Qian Yue still replied indifferently.</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently nodded before launching into a conversation about some trivial matters with Qian Yue, most of which were about some interesting rumours he had heard which actually piqued Qian Yue’s interest. Although her expression remained cold, her beautiful eyes were quite animated and revealed a curious light.</p>
<p>After a long time, Yang Kai’s voice abruptly came to a halt as his expression became serious once more, nodding to Qian Yue slightly, “Alright. The Divine Sense which was monitoring us has withdrawn.”</p>
<p>Qian Yue expression also became serious while some surprise flashed across her eyes at the same time as she said, “Yang Kai, you really are a bit difficult to see through. When you were just a Transcendent, you dared to break into the Ice Sect all alone, and now you’ve come to Joyous Union Pavilion and are actually able to detect the Divine Sense surveillance of those people. How did you accomplish that?”</p>
<p>Any Divine Sense that would be monitoring this place must belong to an Origin Returning Realm master! If not for seeing Yang Kai’s expression which was silently warning her about this, Qian Yue wouldn’t have cooperated with him.</p>
<p>However, Qian Yue could clearly tell that Yang Kai’s cultivation had only reached the Second-Order Saint King Realm, something which greatly surprised her for many reasons.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled lightly and explained, “My Divine Sense is a bit stronger than the average cultivator’s.”</p>
<p>“This can’t be described as merely being a bit stronger,” Qian Yue shook her head wryly but didn’t try to dig any deeper, instead asking eagerly, “Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to ask you the exact same question,” Yang Kai looked at her seriously.</p>
<p>“It’s a long story,” Qian Yue smiled bitterly, picking up the teapot to pour both of them a cup before sorting out her thoughts and continuing, “Presumably you should know by now why Ice Sect had established itself in that glacial world?</p>
<p>“En, I have a fair understanding. It must have been to guard against the resurgence of the Bone Race,” Yang Kai nodded lightly, his memories of the past surfacing slowly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but the Bone Race’s reappearance was far more violent than what our Ice Sect anticipated and after many years of decline, we were unable to resist them by relying on just the few Saint Realm masters we possessed! Fortunately, the Seniors of Ice Sect had seized a Star Shuttle during their first conflict with the Bone Race and that Star Shuttle had been passed down from one generation of Sect Master to the next. After Ice Sect was destroyed, Qing Ya knew that she wouldn’t be able to escape with us in tow so we had no choice but to risk entering the Void Corridor nearby and rely on the power of the Star Shuttle to enter the Star Field!”</p>
<p>“En, it’s just as I had inquired about,” Yang Kai took a deep breath, “After entering the Star Field though, how did you wind up here? Where are Sect Master Qing Ya and Su Yan?” Yang Kai asked anxiously.</p>
<p>Qian Yue’s expression dimmed suddenly, and upon seeing this, Yang Kai’s face turned pale as fear and anxiety threatened to overcome him.</p>
<p>Seeing his look, Qian Yue immediately knew that he had misunderstood her and quickly waved her hands, “It’s not what you think. Although I don’t know where they are now, Sect Master Qing Ya and Su Yan are definitely still alive.”</p>
<p>“How can you be so sure?” Yang Kai looked at her suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Because of this,” Qian Yue turned her palm over and summoned two pure and flawless ice crystal beads, each of them only the size of a thumbnail.</p>
<p>As soon as he saw these two ice beads, Yang Kai was startled and his eyes immediately became fixed on one of them in particular, unable to look away. He felt Su Yan’s aura from this ice bead while the other carried Qing Ya’s.</p>
<p>“What are these?” Yang Kai eventually looked up at Qian Yue.</p>
<p>“These are Ice Soul Beads created using one of our Ice Sect’s secret techniques. This bead will only shatter when the person who condensed it falls!” Qian Yue explained softly, “Every Ice Soul Bead corresponds to a specific person. We were also concerned that we would become separated after entering the Star Field, so we condensed several sets of these just in case. I have the others’ Ice Soul Bead in my hands, and they have my Ice Soul Beads in theirs. Since these two Ice Soul Beads haven’t broken, that can only mean they are still alive!”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yang Kai finally calmed down as a look of pleasant surprise flashed across his eyes.</p>
<p>As long as Su Yan was alive, he could feel at ease. Although he didn’t know where she was right now, there would be a day when they would meet again, of this, Yang Kai was convinced.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a moment, Yang Kai asked, “This Ice Soul Bead, can you give it to me?”</p>
<p>Qian Yue smiled lightly, “Of course; after all, you are little Su Yan’s most beloved person in the world.”</p>
<p>Saying so, she handed over the Ice Soul Bead that belonged to Su Yan. Yang Kai expressed his thanks once more before accepting it.</p>
<p>Staring at the cold bead, Yang Kai couldn’t help reminiscing about Su Yan’s appearance and the smile she showed him all those years ago, a trace of tenderness filling his expression. Yang Kai indulged in this reverie for a moment before very cautiously placing this Ice Soul Bead into his Black Book Space.</p>
<p>After doing this, Yang Kai let out a sigh of relief as his mind and body seemed to relax greatly. The invisible pressure which had been weighing on his heart for so long finally lifted at this moment and the Saint Qi in his body began to involuntarily churn, causing the surrounding World Energy to stir violently.</p>
<p>After learning that Su Yan had not encountered any kind of fatal accident, relieving the stress in his heart, Yang Kai’s aura began to surge and he showed signs of breaking through.</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai hadn’t mentioned the matter about Su Yan to anyone for a long time, and even if he only occasionally had time to think about it, the subtle worry he felt had never left him and had become something of a stumbling block for his process.</p>
<p>Now, feeling Su Yan’s aura once more, this shackle had been released. As long as this Ice Soul Bead still existed, Yang Kai could rest assured that she was still alive, so naturally, he was able to relax. After refining the Profound Yin Sunflower Water in the Flowing Flame Sand Field, his cultivation had reached the peak of the Second-Order Saint King Realm, and now that almost two years had passed, he had truly reached the edge of a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Today’s matter was simply a sudden opportunity, and even if it hadn’t happened, Yang Kai estimated that within three to six months he would still be able to break through. Him being in a rush to return to Dragon Cave Mountain was also because he wanted to make preparations for this breakthrough.</p>
<p>The abnormalities in Yang Kai’s aura naturally didn’t escape Qian Yue’s eyes and she couldn’t help looking at him in surprise. A look of delight appeared on her face and Qian Yue was just about to congratulate him when suddenly Yang Kai frowned and forcibly suppressed the roiling of his Saint Qi. A moment later, after his face went a bit red, nothing more happened.</p>
<h2>1314</h2>
<p>Chapter 1314, Qian Yue’s Bitter Experience</p>
<p>The surrounding World Energy, which had been disturbed by Yang Kai’s surge in aura, quickly settled and returned to normal.</p>
<p>“Why would you give up such an opportunity?” Qian Yue asked with a slight look of pity in her eyes.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled and shook his head, “It’s fine, I will have another one sooner or later. Right now, I’d rather learn more about your current situation, like how you wound up separated after entering the Star Field.”</p>
<p>Qian Yue heard this and couldn’t help flashing a bitter smile, nodding after a moment of silence and agreeing, “Alright, your mood is unstable right now so it’s not the best time to break through anyways.”</p>
<p>After collecting her thoughts, Qian Yue began explaining what happened after she and the other Elders of Ice Sect entered the Star Field.</p>
<p>Through Qian Yue’s narration, Yang Kai realized that the initial journey she and the others had through the Star Field was far more dangerous than his own, especially when it came to Starry Sky Storms and vast Asteroid Seas.</p>
<p>In terms of physical strength and Soul cultivation, none of the Ice Sect survivors could match Yang Kai, so after entering the Star Field, they were immediately beset by crisis. If not for Qing Ya and the other Saints doing their utmost to protect her, with Su Yan’s cultivation, she would have quickly fallen.</p>
<p>Even so, two Saint Realm Elders of Ice Sect had failed to withstand the impact of a particularly harsh Starry Sky Storm and fallen, leaving behind only Sect Master Qing Ya, Su Yan, Qian Yue, and Qian Hao.</p>
<p>These four had continued wandering destitute through the Star Field for several years before they stumbled upon a Void Corridor.</p>
<p>Although they had no idea what kind of dangers might lie beyond this Void Corridor, if they gave up this opportunity, they would soon be unable to support themselves.</p>
<p>So, after some discussions, the four dove into the Void Corridor, but this particular Void Corridor seemed to be a little unstable and actually had many internal forks, causing their group to inadvertently be dispersed. After Qian Yue passed through this Void Corridor, she found herself on Shadowed Star.</p>
<p>As for the others, she could not tell where they went.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression became much heavier after hearing this.</p>
<p>If they had simply been separated after passing through the same fork in this Void Corridor, then Sect Master Qing Ya, Elder Qian Hao, and Su Yan must have also arrived on Shadowed Star, but if they had taken different forks, who knows where they could have been sent?</p>
<p>Moreover, Yang Kai was at least ninety percent certain that the other three weren’t on Shadowed Star, because if they were, he would have been able to faintly sense Su Yan’s presence, and as he grew stronger, this link would have become easier to detect.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had used a drop of Golden Blood and circumnavigate all of Shadowed Star, so if Su Yan was really here, he would definitely have been aware of it.</p>
<p>[Void Corridors could have multiple branches!] This concept startled Yang Kai quite a bit, but he soon felt that with the world being so vast, such things should not really be a surprise. He was still just a small Second-Order Saint King, so there were obviously many things he could not understand yet.</p>
<p>The Ice Soul Beads indeed showed that the other three were still alive, but it did not provide any clues as to where in the Star Field they might be.</p>
<p>When Qian Yue arrived on Shadowed Star, she appeared near Black Crow City. At that time, she had just passed through an unstable Void Corridor and been seriously wounded, with almost no power to protect herself. Unfortunately, soon after, she encountered several heinous cultivators who, after seeing her extraordinary appearance, immediately had ill intentions towards her. Fortunately, a nearby Origin Returning Realm master happened to pass by, rescued her, and brought her back to Joyous Union Pavilion.</p>
<p>Since then, Qian Yue had lived in Joyous Union Pavilion and cultivated the Dual Cultivation Technique given to her by the Origin Realm master who saved her.</p>
<p>As time passed, Qian Yue gradually understood what kind of place she had been brought to and what fate would be waiting for her. Fortunately, her cultivation was not low and after quickly reaching the First-Order Saint King Realm, no ordinary person would be able to afford her. Occasionally, several distinguished guests who paid a lot of money had come here, but none of them had selected her, allowing her to retain her freedom until now.</p>
<p>Today though, when she received word that an Honoured Guest would soon be visiting her boudoir and that she would need to give him her innocence, Qian Yue’s heart had been thrown into turmoil, but to her great surprise this VIP actually turned out to be Yang Kai.</p>
<p>While Qian Yue told her story, Yang Kai did not interrupt and simply listened attentively.</p>
<p>It seemed that recalling all her bitter experiences made Qian Yue a bit emotional and she would sometimes wipe a few tears that leaked from her eyes as she spoke. Before, she had been an Elder of Ice Sect, and although her reputation wasn’t resounding, she was still one of the top masters in all of Tong Xuan Realm, but after entering the Star Field, before she could even see any of its wonders, she had encountered several life threatening disasters and when she finally settled down, she had actually been put under house arrest and degenerated into a prostitute.</p>
<p>Her circumstances before and after could only be described as worlds apart.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not know how to comfort her. In a certain sense, Qian Yue could barely be considered his Elder, but as one’s cultivation rose, they would pile up many different experiences, making it impossible to judge one’s true age from their appearance and demeanor. If Yang Kai tried to comfort her as a peer, it would instead feel more like he was overstepping himself.</p>
<p>After Qian Yue had settled down somewhat, Yang Kai asked, “Do you still remember the scenes of the Star Field you saw before you entered that Void Corridor?”</p>
<p>“I can’t be certain, but I do still have some impressions of the nearby star patterns,” Qian Yue gently nodded.</p>
<p>“Okay...” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, “Then another day you’ll have to describe those star patterns to me!”</p>
<p>“Naturally, that’s not a problem, but with that alone, how do you plan on determining that location?”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry about that, I naturally have my ways. Right, you mentioned just now that there was a restriction placed on you, correct? If it is convenient, can you show it to me?”</p>
<p>“It should be fine for you to examine it, but don’t act rashly. That seal was placed on me by the Origin Returning Realm master who rescued me, one of the managers of this Joyous Union Pavilion. She spends most of her days in a secret room in this compound meditating, so if she is alarmed, the consequences will definitely be dire.”</p>
<p>“En, I understand,” Yang Kai nodded lightly before reaching out and placing two fingers on Qian Yue’s wrist. Injecting a thread of his Saint Qi into her body, Yang Kai began examining the seal placed on her.</p>
<p>As he investigated this restriction, Yang Kai’s expression gradually became dignified.</p>
<p>After some time, Yang Kai withdrew his fingers, revealed a thoughtful expression, and said, “It’s not too vicious a seal, it seems its only purpose is to stop you from running away.”</p>
<p>“En, I tried to escape a few times, but every time she activated this seal, I became too weak to even move. If it were not for me breaking through to the Saint King Realm in the past few years, she wouldn’t have been so forgiving towards me.”</p>
<p>A few years ago, Qian Yue was just a Saint Realm cultivator, but to the Joyous Union Pavilion, the worth of a Saint Realm woman was incomparable to that of a Saint King Realm woman. It was for this reason that even though Qian Yue tried to run away multiple times, she only received a bit of light punishment.</p>
<p>After Qian Yue successfully broke through to the Saint King Realm, she was immediately pushed into becoming a Dual Cultivation partner for rich cultivators.</p>
<p>It was obvious now that the reason that Origin Realm master had rescued Qian Yue at that time was because of it. After all, Qian Yue seemed to be all alone, had decent cultivation, and had her innocence intact. Rescuing and cultivating her was undoubtedly more cost-effective for the Joyous Union Pavilion than training a girl from scratch.</p>
<p>“I’ve told you my story now, but what about yours? What is the situation in Tong Xuan Realm? Did the Bone Race wreak havoc?” Qian Yue sorted out her appearance and asked nervously.</p>
<p>Although she had come to the Star Field, Tong Xuan Realm was still her home and she could not help worrying about it.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled lightly, “Don’t worry about the Bone Race, they’ve been annihilated. Tong Xuan Realm was quite prosperous when I left, and the relationship between the Demon Race, Monster Race and Human Race was also much more harmonious after they worked together to defeat a common enemy.”</p>
<p>“The Bone Race has been annihilated?” Qian Yue was shocked to hear this and quickly asked, “How did it happen?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai explained briefly about how all of Tong Xuan Realm’s races banded together to fight the Bone Race. Qian Yue listened with a fascinated look, and after understanding the events of that great battle, Yang Kai also explained to her about his experiences in the Star Field.</p>
<p>Compared with Qian Yue’s experience, Yang Kai’s was far more fantastical but also far more dangerous.</p>
<p>After Yang Kai entered the Star Field, he had quickly been captured and imprisoned in the Power Room of a Starship where his Saint Qi was continuously extracted to replenish its energy reserves. Soon after, the Starship he was aboard was caught in the Chaotic Abyss’ domain eruption and was destroyed, resulting in him being stranded on the strange floating continent with Gui Zu. Eventually escaping from the floating continent, Yang Kai then went to Water Moon Star where he had inexplicably drawn the attention of Xue Yue Third Young Master of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce and taken a perilous journey filled with unexpected twists and turns to Rainfall Star.</p>
<p>After unlocking the Soul Chains, Yang Kai had then escaped from Rainfall Star and been trapped in a deep sleep inside the strange blood-red crystal for several years, eventually drifting all the way to Shadowed Star where he was fished from the Starry Sky by Wu Yi and the others from the Hai Ke Family.</p>
<p>Only after explaining everything up until and including his recent exploration of the Flowing Flame Sand Field did Yang Kai stop.</p>
<p>Of course, Yang Kai intentionally brushed over the strange ‘battle’ he had fought with Xue Yue Third Young Master on that unnamed Dead Star, as well as the fact that Xue Yue was a woman.</p>
<p>After listening to his story, Qian Yue could not help feeling a sense of envy, as well as admiration. What she envied was the free and unconstrained life Yang Kai had while what she admired was how he had crossed so many dangerous roads after entering the Star Field. His original intentions of entering the Star Field to Su Yan also improved Qian Yue’s impression of him greatly and she even felt that Su Yan had not entrusted herself to the wrong person.</p>
<p>On top of that, seeing his concern about Su Yan just now, it was obvious that even after so many years had passed, Su Yan’s weight in his heart had not diminished in the slightest.</p>
<p>After falling silent for a moment though, Qian Yue suddenly smiled meaningfully as she stared at Yang Kai and said, “Seeing you like this, it seems you’ve really led an unrestrained life, you even have the time and mind to come to a place like this!”</p>
<p>Gawking for a moment, Yang Kai quickly understood that she was speaking to uphold justice for Su Yan and quickly waved his hands, “Elder Qian Yue misunderstands, I have a reason for coming here.”</p>
<p>“Of course you have a reason, every man who comes here says the same when he’s asked, but in light of your performance just now, on behalf of Su Yan, I will give you a chance to explain yourself. If you really have some important reasons to come here, then so be it, but if not... hmph, don’t blame this Elder for speaking a few malicious remarks to Su Yan the next time we meet,” Qian Yue said with a faint grin.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes swam as his heart clenched but he quickly regained his composure and began explaining about Chen Fan Lei inviting him to come here as well as his suspicions about Wang Yu Han’s interference.</p>
<p>Silavin: lol. Guys, next time, when you visit a prostitution bar, and your girlfriend finds out, tell them:</p>
<p>“It was night out and I felt there was someone following me. I needed to go somewhere crowded. Look. I only entered the room to hide. Nothing more than that.”</p>

<p>Chapter 1315, Redeeming</p>

<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>Qian Yue was able to become an Elder of Ice Sect, and had also cultivated to the Second-Order Saint Realm on Tong Xuan Realm, so naturally, she was an intelligent woman. After listening to Yang Kai’s explanation, how could she not understand the circumstances surrounding his situation?</p>
<p>After pondering for a while, she nodded, “If it is as you say, you really do have a reason for coming here, but that Wang Yu Han is quite the schemer, the plan he came up with fulfils his objective while allowing him to remain hidden. He’s not someone to be underestimated.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled faintly and said, “If him plotting against me like this is just to discredit me in Chen Shi Tao’s eyes, then so be it, but if he has other malicious intent, heh...”</p>
<p>Although he had guessed what Wang Yu Han’s plan was, Yang Kai didn’t intend to leave here right away. Originally, he had been planning to wait here and force Wang Yu Han to reveal his true intentions, but after seeing Qian Yue’s figure on those silver mirrors, he had naturally pushed the plot along and come to this Snow and Ice Pavilion.</p>
<p>“It seems you’re still as fearless as ever,” Qian Yue muttered absent-mindedly, the scene of Yang Kai breaking into Ice Sect alone and running amok suddenly flashing across her memories. Whether it was at that time or now, Yang Kai’s strength hadn’t been very high, but he dared to do things ordinary people would never even dream of. After pondering for a while, Qian Yue continued, “But since you dare to do this, you must have some degree of confidence, so I won’t try to persuade you otherwise; however, you have to be careful. I don’t want to have to collect the dead body of an old acquaintance I managed to encounter after so long.”</p>
<p>“Rest assured, if I cannot win, I can still escape,” Yang Kai grinned, “However, you have to tell me first, what kind of background does this Joyous Union Pavilion have?”</p>
<p>“Background?” Qian Yue’s brow furrowed slightly, “I don’t know much about the specific situation; after all, since I came here, I haven’t had much contact with outsiders, but occasionally I overheard some gossip from the maidservants. There are three Origin Returning Realm masters who oversee this place, and Joyous Union Pavilion itself seems to be the hidden industry of a Sect called Imperial City Sect. They also seem to have the support of the City Lord here.”</p>
<p>“Imperial City Sect?” Yang Kai froze for a moment, feeling like he had dealt with members of this Sect somewhere before, but even after thinking about it for a while, he was unable to remember.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t remember though, it shouldn’t have been anything important, so Yang Kai didn’t pay it any mind. Stroking his chin for a moment, he began pondering out loud, “Three Origin Returning Realm masters standing guard here, its not a weak lineup.”</p>
<p>Seeing the strange light flashing across his eyes, Qian Yue beautiful face changed and she hurriedly asked, “What do you want to do?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai waved his hand lightly and smiled, “It’s not what you think. I have no grudge or grievance with this place, so I don’t plan on stirring up trouble, I simply want to take you away from here.”</p>
<p>“Take me away?” A look of joy flashed across Qian Yue’s face; however, her expression quickly dimmed and she said with a bitter smile, “Leading me away from here won’t be easy.”</p>
<p>“Is there some kind of problem?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Naturally there are problems, and not small ones at that! Since you can come to Snow and Ice Pavilion, you must have paid a lot of Saint Crystal, yes? I don’t know where you obtained those Saint Crystals from, but just one night with me already costs so much, so the price to take me away from here must be at least ten times as high. Do you have that many Saint Crystals?” Obviously in her opinion, it was impossible for Yang Kai to have so many Saint Crystal. Just the fee for a night of passion here was already an astronomical figure in Qian Yue’s eyes.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai just smiled happily and replied, “You don’t need to worry about this, I can take out a trivial few Saint Crystals.”</p>
<p>“A trivial few...” Qian Yue couldn’t help covering her red lips as she stared at Yang Kai in amazement, as if she wanted to confirm it was really him once more. No matter how she thought about it, she wasn’t able to figure out how Yang Kai could possess such great wealth.</p>
<p>“I just don’t know if the Joyous Union Pavilion will let you go. It stands to reason that a woman like you, after receiving an Honoured Guest and losing your Primordial Yin, wouldn’t be too important to Joyous Union Pavilion,” Yang Kai thought out loud, but upon saying these words a hint of embarrassment flashed across his face, “This Yang’s words were too crass, I hope Elder Qian Yue won’t take offence!”</p>
<p>Qian Yue’s pretty face blushed lightly, giving her quite a charming appearance, but she quickly recovered and calmly said, “It’s fine, what you said is true, but do you think that Joyous Union Pavilion’s people won’t be able to see I still have my Primordial Yin? While I still retain it, you wanting to purchase me might be a bit difficult.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai couldn’t help but frown, “That will probably be the case. I’m afraid that Joyous Union Pavilion will use this point to try to raise the price, but that’s fine. There’s nothing that can’t be negotiated in this world, it all depends on whether an appropriate price can be paid. Both you and I are from Tong Xuan Realm, and encountering each other here is nothing short of divine intervention, so no matter what I can’t just leave you here.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Qian Yue’s face flashed a trace of gratitude and didn’t say anything more; instead, she began looking forward to the future in her heart. If there was a chance for her to leave here, how could she choose to remain? Yang Kai’s arrival today had finally given her a glimmer of hope, and if she missed this opportunity, all that would await her was a destitute life as a product sold to men for dual cultivation.</p>
<p>Following up, Yang Kai asked for more details about Joyous Union Pavilion. Qian Yue naturally told him everything she knew; unfortunately, her limited knowledge wasn’t much help to him.</p>
<p>After an hour or so, Qian Yue summoned a maidservant of Joyous Union Pavilion, and after giving her some instructions, the maidservant showed a shocked expression and directed a complex look towards Yang Kai before quickly leaving.</p>
<p>After the time it would take to boil a cup of tea, the young woman who had dealt with Yang Kai before appeared and looked towards him with a smile, a strange light flashing across her eyes, apparently having heard some information from the maidservant.</p>
<p>Qian Yue personally offered tea before standing beside Yang Kai, a slightly nervous expression on her face.</p>
<p>The young woman took a few sips of the tea before lightly opening her lip and exhaling an orchid scent while asking, “I heard that the Young Lord intends to redeem Yue’er and present her freedom?”</p>
<p>“It is as you heard,” Yang Kai nodded calmly, getting straight to the point, “I am very satisfied with Lady Yue’er, so I want to take her out of here. I wonder if your noble establishment is willing to part with her?”</p>
<p>The young woman giggled and looked at Qian Yue with a hint of surprise in her eyes before saying, “If this Mistress isn’t mistaken, Yue’er’s Primordial Yin is still intact. Since Young Lord has not yet savoured her most precious possession, why do you want to take Yue’er away?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned, “I naturally have my reasons, does your noble establishment insist on inquiring into such matters?”</p>
<p>“Please forgive me, Young Lord, it’s just that there is little precedent for girls from Joyous Union Pavilion to be redeemed. This Mistress has to be a bit cautious.”</p>
<p>A trace of embarrassment appeared on Yang Kai’s face as he seemed to hesitate for a moment before saying, “Since that’s the case, it seems I really should give your noble establishment an explanation. Good, I have indeed not partaken of Lady Yue’er’s innocence, what I am interested in however is her Ice Attribute Secret Art. It has some use for my future cultivation.”</p>
<p>“Her Ice Attribute Secret Art? If that is the case, then this Mistress is even more confused. Those who cultivate such Secret Arts are innumerable, why does Young Lord insist on needing Yue’er specifically?” Saying so, the young woman fixed her beautiful eyes on Yang Kai’s, seemingly wanting to see into the depths of his soul.</p>
<p>Yang Kai chuckled, “There are indeed a lot of cultivators who cultivate Ice Attribute Secret Arts, but those who I feel intimate with are not many. If I said I fell in love with Lady Yue’er at first sight, would you believe it?”</p>
<p>The young woman couldn’t help giggling, and Qian Yue standing beside Yang Kai also showed a high of blush on her face, giving her a shy and embarrassed look.</p>
<p>“Whether you believe it or not, it is the truth. I have nothing to hide,” Yang Kai argued strongly, as if he would go to his death swearing it was the truth.</p>
<p>The young woman’s brow furrowed as she suddenly stood up and walked over to Qian Yue, holding the other’s arm intimately as she smiled elegantly to Yang Kai, “Please don’t be upset, Young Lord. It’s not that this Mistress is trying to make things difficult, it’s just that Yue’er is a disciple Joyous Union Pavilion has cultivated since childhood and invested a great number of resources into. Moreover, this Mistress and Yue’er have a bond of sisterhood, so I am truly reluctant to part with her. I truly hope that she can stay here with me forever.”</p>
<p>“Cultivated since childhood, a bond of sisterhood...” Yang Kai smiled faintly, but the smile on the young woman’s face didn’t diminish as she stared back confidently at him.</p>
<p>If Yang Kai hadn’t known Qian Yue from before and has been aware of her origins, he would likely have been deceived here. This young woman’s ability to talk nonsense was quite astonishing.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s look suddenly became serious and he waved, “Name your price. Since you haven’t directly refused, there’s obviously room for negotiation. Give me a number and I will see if it can bear it. As long as we can reach an agreement, this transaction can be completed.”</p>
<p>The young woman curled her lips before turning and returning to her seat, saying lightly, “Since Young Lord wants to get straight to business, this Mistress won’t delay any further. Indeed, our Joyous Union Pavilion has precedents for girls being redeemed, but there has never been a Saint King girl among them. If Young Lord wishes to set such a precedent, the price you will have to pay will not be small.”</p>
<p>“Go on,” Yang Kai looked at her lightly.</p>
<p>The young woman’s brows furrowed slightly as she glanced over at Qian Yue and said, “If Yue’er had lost her Primordial Yin, it would be a different matter entirely, but since she still retains her innocence, her price will naturally be higher. “</p>
<p>“Haven’t you made a mistake?” Yang Kai sneered suddenly, “I already paid quite a few Saint Crystals for tonight, so in principle, Lady Yue’er’s Primordial Yin already belongs to me, yet you actually want to take it as a chip to bargain with?”</p>
<p>“There is indeed some truth to that,” The young woman pursed her lips and smiled, “But does Young Lord really wish to claim Yue’er’s Primordial Yin? If not then it must be taken into account. However, if Young Lord wishes to unite with Yue’er now, this Mistress won’t interfere. When your dual cultivation sessions finishes, we can discuss this matter again. How about it?”</p>
<p>She seemed to understand that Yang Kai wouldn’t do this, so she fully intended to take advantage of this point.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face went cold, while Qian Yue’s expression also became quite bitter. Being forced to watch others bargaining back and forth over her like she was some kind of item for sale, even discussing the matter of her purity like it was a selling feature, caused Qian Yue’s face to turn sour.</p>
<h2>1316</h2>
<p>Chapter 1316, Bargaining</p>
<p>Listening to this young woman’s words, if he were to take Qian Yue’s Primordial Yin right now, the price to redeem her would undoubtedly be much lower. Just as Yang Kai and Qian Yue had previously concluded, but how could Yang Kai possibly do this?</p>
<p>In this situation, Yang Kai could do nothing but hold his nose and accept it! This caused him to feel quite depressed in his heart.</p>
<p>With a cold face, he continued, “I cannot accept your proposal, so your demand is reasonable.”</p>
<p>When the young woman saw him compromise, she immediately smiled happily and said, “Without even mentioning the resources Yue’er has consumed for her cultivation so far, just the Dual Cultivation Technique she has cultivated is a core secret of our Joyous Union Pavilion. Since Young Lord has plans to redeem her, I believe there is a need to discuss how to deal with this particular problem, yes? Or could it be possible that Young Lord intends to purchase our Dual Cultivation Technique as well?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face changed slightly, suddenly recognizing that he had ignored this problem, but he quickly realized something and immediately retorted, “Surely you must be joking. Although this Dual Cultivation Technique is indeed your noble establishment’s core secret, as far as I know, there should be many hidden dangers with using it, correct?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, the young woman shot a cold glare towards Qian Yue, seemingly believing she had revealed something she should not have.</p>
<p>Yang Kai quickly interjected though, “You may rest assured, Lady Yue’er did not tell me anything about your Dual Cultivation Technique, I simply know that there is no Secret Art which is so convenient in this world. The Dual Cultivation Technique of your noble establishment is indeed quite unique, but it must surely have its drawbacks as well.”</p>
<p>The look on the young woman’s face became a bit complicated, but she didn’t try to deny Yang Kai’s assertion, simply nodding a moment later and saying, “Being able to see through this point, Young Lord is also a person of great insight it seems. En, our Joyous Union Pavilion’s Dual Cultivation Technique does have hidden dangers, but this kind of thing is not a secret. Many people know about it and even the guests who come here for this service are aware.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” It was Yang Kai’s turn to be surprised this time, “Could you explain a bit more?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. In any case, if you go outside to inquire a bit, you will be able to learn of it anyway. The hidden dangers of using our Dual Cultivation Technique to break through a bottleneck is that your cultivation will never again increase.”</p>
<p>“I see!” Yang Kai gently nodded, “Since they know about this danger, why come here to break through a bottleneck in the first place?”</p>
<p>“Because the customers who feel they have no hope of breaking through in their lifetime naturally don’t care about such detriments. If they come here, perhaps they can advance another step. If it were Young Lord in their place, and you were unable to break through your bottleneck even after hundreds of years, and you learned our Joyous Union Pavilion might provide that opportunity, how would you choose?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai thought for a moment before nodding in agreement, “I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to resist such temptation.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Our Dual Cultivation Technique does indeed have hidden dangers, but it is still a rare and powerful Secret Art. Young Lord wants to redeem Yue’er, and Yue’er knows how to cultivate this Dual Cultivation Technique, so who could say for certain that Young Lord doesn’t have ideas about this Secret Art?”</p>
<p>“You’re well aware of the truth, so why try to press me over this?” Yang Kai coldly snorted, “I’m not stupid enough to destroy my great future with a mere dual cultivation session.”</p>
<p>The young woman laughed lightly, “I am certainly not pressing Young Lord, it is simply necessary for this Mistress to remind Young Lord about this point. However, if Young Lord still insists on taking Yue’er away, there is room for negotiation.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to hear the details!” Yang Kai raised his brow.</p>
<p>“If Yue’er had cultivated the most core principles of our Dual Cultivation Technique, even if Young Lord offered an extraordinary price, this Mistress would not dare to let her go. Fortunately, Yue’er has not been cultivating this technique for very long and has not studied its core concepts yet. As such, some accommodations can be made. This Mistress has two proposals for Young Lord to consider.”</p>
<p>With that said, she looked to Yang Kai and waited until he signaled her to continue before stating casually, “The first proposal is very simple, Yue’er simply needs to abolish her Dual Cultivation Technique.”</p>
<p>As soon as this was said, Qian Yue’s face turned pale and her tender body shivered.</p>
<p>Yang Kai could not help but frown. Although this Dual Cultivation Technique was something Qian Yue had been forced to cultivate after coming to Joyous Union Pavilion, she had nevertheless incorporated it into her cultivation. If it were to be abolished, it would affect her negatively. If her luck was good, it would simply cause some damage to her foundation which could be restored with enough time and resources, but if she was unlucky, it may leave her permanently crippled.</p>
<p>Naturally, Yang Kai immediately shook his head, “This option is unacceptable, tell me about the second one.”</p>
<p>The young woman seemed to have expected this and continued with a smile, “The second option is, Young Lord simply must pay a bit more.”</p>
<p>“Enough to cover the expense of the first parts of Yue’er Dual Cultivation Technique, right?” Yang Kai asked pointedly.</p>
<p>“That is indeed what this Mistress is proposing. Does Young Lord have any issue with this option?”</p>
<p>“Your proposal is reasonable, so I have no problems with it,” Yang Kai nodded lightly.</p>
<p>The young woman’s expression filled with happiness as she nodded, “Young Lord is really a straightforward person. But if it is like this, the price Young Lord must pay will not be small.”</p>
<p>“What kind of price does your noble establishment want then?” Yang Kai stared at her fixedly.</p>
<p>The young woman frowned slightly and thought for a moment before reporting a number.</p>
<p>Qian Yue’s tender body shook noticeably as she stood beside Yang Kai, her eyes flashing a trace of despair. The price was shockingly high. From Qian Yue’s meager understanding of Shadowed Star, she knew that such an amount of Saint Crystals would be enough to buy an excellent Origin Grade artifact. Even if she were to spend the rest of her life saving, she may not necessarily be able to accumulate such a sum.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s calm and indifferent expression also gave way to one of frustration as he hesitantly stroked his chin.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the young woman smiled slightly, “Young Lord, there’s no point in trying to bargain this price down. Since this Mistress has reported such a number, you can rest assured that it is in line with our Joyous Union Pavilion’s policies and not something I can simply change at will. If you cannot afford the price, please give up.”</p>
<p>Her last sentence was spoken quite bluntly, as if she had already determined that Yang Kai was strong in will but weak in strength. She was not prepared to waste any more time with him.</p>
<p>Yang Kai let out a sigh and said, “Such a huge amount of Saint Crystals really makes things difficult for me.”</p>
<p>The young woman sneered but did not say anything further.</p>
<p>Quickly advancing the conversation though, Yang Kai continued, “Would your noble establishment be willing to accept some items as collateral?”</p>
<p>“Collateral?” The young woman’s brow rose slightly.</p>
<p>“Yes. artifacts, pills, materials, or other valuables,” Yang Kai replied, “These items are all important for this Yang, so I can only offer them as collateral. After returning home, I will raise enough Saint Crystals and return to redeem them. After all, no one simply carries such a large amount of Saint Crystals with them.”</p>
<p>“What Young Lord says makes sense, but it also depends on what you are willing to put up as collateral. If Young Lord were to simply toss out a few random items but never return, wouldn’t my Joyous Union Pavilion wind up suffering a loss?”</p>
<p>“You need not worry about this point, since I must offer something as collateral, they will definitely be important treasures, it is impossible for me to not return to redeem them.” Saying so, Yang Kai wore a look of struggle for a moment before waving his hand and taking out two jade bottles, two artifacts, and a Space Ring. Placing these items on the table between them, Yang Kai pushed them towards the young woman and said lightly, “Please see for yourself if this will be enough.”</p>
<p>The young woman gave Yang Kai a suspicious look but quickly nodded. Picking up the Space Ring first, she swept its contents with her Divine Sense. After discovering that there were some Saint Crystals in it, she put this ring back down without any change in expression; after all, the number of Saint Crystals in this ring was far lower than the price she had just quoted.</p>
<p>Next picking up one of the jade bottles, she opened it and took a sniff. In the next instant, her beautiful face changed slightly, and she quickly poured a pill out of the bottle onto her palm and began carefully inspecting it. After a moment, she showed a trace of surprise and muttered, “An Origin Grade Low-Rank Fire Cloud Pill, and its quality is extremely high. Which Alchemy Grandmaster refined this?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai wore a neutral expression, showing no intention to answer her.</p>
<p>The young woman’s expression immediately became more dignified than before, because in order to obtain such a bottle of Origin Grade Low-Rank pills, it was necessary to have a strong connection with an Alchemy Grandmaster and possess extraordinary status and wealth. Realizing this, she no longer dared look down on Yang Kai.</p>
<p>After all, Imperial City Sect, which was Joyous Union Pavilion’s secret backer was only a mid-rank Sect and they possessed no such Grandmaster.</p>
<p>Checking the other pill bottle, the young woman found it also contained Origin Grade Low-Rank pills, allowing her to affirm the speculation in her heart. These two pill bottles were incredibly valuable, not something that could be purchased simply by possessing enough Saint Crystals.</p>
<p>The two artifacts, on the other hand, were not as impressive, just ordinary Saint King Grade High-Rank artifacts. However, they were still worth a fair number of Saint Crystals.</p>
<p>“These two bottles are treasures I had to expend great effort to obtain and are very useful for my future cultivation, so you may rest assured I will come back for them,” Yang Kai said with a slight smile to the young woman.</p>
<p>The young woman nodded slowly; all of her previous suspicions being swept aside. In truth, these two bottles of pills were treasures that even ordinary Origin Realm masters might not necessarily be able to possess. A Second Order Saint King having them clearly indicated he had extraordinary connections and means.</p>
<p>What she did not know was that these pills were things Yang Kai had refined himself.</p>
<p>Seeing her fall into contemplation, Yang Kai did not say anything further, simply casting a glance of reassurance to Qian Yue. He could tell that this young woman was very interested in the offer he had made and shouldn’t try to put forward any kind of excessive request, so as soon as this transaction was completed, he would immediately take Qian Yue away from Black Crow City and never return.</p>
<p>As for the pills and artifacts he just handed over, how could Yang Kai care about such insignificant things?</p>
<p>The reason Yang Kai had not just taken out the number of Saint Crystals this young woman had asked for was simply out of an abundance of caution. Casually taking out such an astonishing amount of wealth would undoubtedly draw unwanted attention.</p>
<p>Having witnessed this entire process, Qian Yue could not help but smile.</p>
<p>After a long time, the young woman seemed to have made a decision and lifted her head to smile at Yang Kai, but just as she was about to speak, a look of surprise appeared on her face and she quickly took out a communication artifact and apologized, “Forgive me Young Lord, please wait a moment.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled and nodded, indicating he did not mind.</p>
<p>The young woman poured her Divine Sense into this communication artifact and seemed to be communicating with someone, her expression fluctuating greatly as the conversation continued.</p>
<p>A moment later, she put away this communication artifact with a confused look before turning to Yang Kai and flashing an awkward expression.</p>
<p>Seeing this look, Yang Kai’s heart sank as he suddenly had a bad premonition.</p>
<h2>1317</h2>
<p>Chapter 1317, Twists And Turns</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain</p>
<p>Sure enough, the young woman smiled apologetically and said, “Young Lord, I’m afraid this deal cannot be completed!”</p>
<p>“Can’t be completed?” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed in annoyance as he asked coldly, “Is this offer not enough?”</p>
<p>“Not at all!” The young woman shook her head helplessly, “It’s just that this Mistress suddenly received orders from above saying that Yue’er cannot be redeemed. As for the specific reason, I’m afraid I cannot say anything more!”</p>
<p>When Qian Yue heard this, her tender body couldn’t help trembling slightly and her face went pale. She had just seen hope of freedom yet now it had been mercilessly taken away.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face was turned ugly and he directed a cold glare at the young woman opposite him, but upon seeing the look of embarrassment on her face, he quickly understood that this was not her doing, so becoming angry with her was useless. Taking a deep breath, he asked thoughtfully, “Did the message you received say that Lady Yue’er cannot be redeemed or that no one can be redeemed?”</p>
<p>“Is there a difference?” The young woman asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Just answer the question.” Yang Kai snorted.</p>
<p>It seemed that because she had suddenly reneged on their agreement this young woman felt somewhat embarrassed, so after pondering for a moment, she replied, “Only Yue’er’s name was mentioned. As for the others, nothing else was said.”</p>
<p>“Is that so!” Yang Kai sneered deeply, a light flashing across his eyes before he continued, “I believe that there is no such thing in this world as a deal that cannot be reached, only prices that cannot be paid. If I were to pay another pill, do you think there’d be room to negotiate?”</p>
<p>Having said this, Yang Kai took out an exquisite jade bottle, held it tightly as a pained look appeared on his face for a moment before solemnly handing it to the young woman.</p>
<p>The young woman however just smiled helplessly, “Young Lord, please don’t make things difficult for this Mistress. Since the managers have already made a decision, this matter is really no longer within my ability to negotiate.”</p>
<p>“Whether you can negotiate this matter or not, please take a look at this pill first. If you really aren’t able to conclude this deal, I hope you can at least contact the person who sent you the message just now and ask him what price I need to pay.”</p>
<p>A trace of surprise flashed across this young woman’s eyes as she said with some astonishment, “It seems that Yue’er is truly important to Young Lord. It is definitely Yue’er’s blessing to be so appreciated by Young Lord.”</p>
<p>When she glanced over at Qian Yue again, she couldn’t help revealing a look of jealousy. Yang insisting on redeeming Qian Yue like this clearly showed how much value she had to him. For a woman who lived in this kind of place, such care was undoubtedly extremely enviable.</p>
<p>As a fellow woman, she could naturally empathize with this.</p>
<p>So instead of refusing Yang Kai again, she opened the small jade bottle and glanced inside. After seeing just what was inside, the casual expression on her face disappeared and was replaced with one of great shock.</p>
<p>There was only one pill in this bottle, and it was round, white, and flawless. It exuded a very pleasant aura, and after sniffing it lightly, the young woman felt her mood quickly become calm.</p>
<p>Immediately after, this young woman shot an amazed look at Yang Kai, and seeing him smiling faintly at her, she didn’t dare to act carelessly, pouring out the pill inside this bottle and examining it carefully.</p>
<p>After a long time, she put the pill back into its bottle and let out a light sigh before turning an unusual look towards Yang Kai, “Although this Mistress doesn’t know much about pills, would I be correct in assuming this is an Extinguishing Demons Pill?”</p>
<p>“It seems your knowledge is quite good, it is indeed an Extinguishing Demons Pill!” Yang Kai nodded as his face twitched slightly as if he was distressed.</p>
<p>“This is one of the best auxiliary pills for Saint King Realm cultivators who are attempting to break through to the Origin Returning Realm. It can even drive out heart demons. Although it is not as rare as the Origin Condensing Pill, its value is comparable. Young Lord, are you sure you want to use this treasure as collateral?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai shook his head, “It’s not collateral, it’s a bargaining chip, if you allow me to redeem Yue’er, this Extinguishing Demons Pill will belong to your Joyous Union Pavilion!”</p>
<p>“A bargaining chip?” A look of joy flashed across the young woman’s face upon hearing this. Gritting her teeth, she declared, “Young Lord, please wait a moment while I contact the managers to see if they are willing to release Yue’er. To be honest, if it were up to me, this deal would have long ago been completed, it’s just...”</p>
<p>She smiled bitterly as she realized just how rare and valuable this Extinguishing Demons Pill was. Not daring to neglect, she quickly took out her communication artifact and poured her Divine Sense into it.</p>
<p>While she was conversing with this unknown party, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed and he released a thread of his Divine Sense quietly to begin sweeping Joyous Union Pavilion. A moment later, besides a few places where there were particularly powerful Spirit Arrays and where there seemed to be Origin Realm masters sitting in meditation, Yang Kai had probed the entire Joyous Union Pavilion.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards, he obtained the information he wanted, and realizing his suspicions were correct, he snickered to himself before quietly withdrawing his Divine Sense, never once exposing anything on his face.</p>
<p>Glancing over at the young woman opposite him, Yang Kai saw her arguing strongly with the party on the other end, her expression quite stern. Obviously, she was unwilling to give up this Extinguishing Demons Pill.</p>
<p>This was only reasonable though. An Extinguishing Demons Pill’s usefulness was very much dependent on the situation. If a small heart demon appeared when a cultivator was trying to break through, there would be no need for this Extinguishing Demons Pill, but if they had a profound heart demon, this kind of pill would be invaluable.</p>
<p>Having such a pill could greatly affect the success or failure of a cultivator breaking through.</p>
<p>The Extinguishing Demons Pill Yang Kai had put out was also something he had refined; he had prepared it for Chang Qi and Hao An when the two of them were attempting to break through to the Origin Returning Realm, but these two already had the Ten Thousand Year Incense Yang Kai brought back from the Flowing Flame Sand Field so they didn’t face any influence from heart demons in the end.</p>
<p>As such, Yang Kai had saved this Extinguishing Demons Pill, and now it happened to come in handy.</p>
<p>Yang Kai also had a number of Origin Condensing Pills on him, but he wasn’t foolish enough to bring these out. Origin Condensing Pills and Extinguishing Demons Pills were supposedly of equal value, but in reality the former was rarer and more precious.</p>
<p>While the young woman continued to converse through her communication artifact, Yang Kai put on an anxious expression. He had to take Qian Yue away from here. It would be best if this deal could be concluded successfully, but if it couldn’t, he could only use more forceful means, subduing this young woman and then immediately fleeing with Qian Yue.</p>
<p>Of course, if the situation devolved to such a point, he would be unable to remain in Black Crow City, so Yang Kai would only use this method as a last resort. He didn’t want to fall out with Joyous Union Pavilion; after all, strong dragons don’t oppose local snakes. Not to mention, he was only a Second-Order Saint King while there were three Origin Realm masters guarding Joyous Union Pavilion. This establishment also seemed to be supported by the local City Lord, so it was definitely not a place to be casually provoked.</p>
<p>With a plan in mind, Yang Kai’s expression became indifferent as he secretly sent a message to Qian Yue, telling her to quietly prepare herself.</p>
<p>Some time later, with an annoyed and somewhat dejected look on her face, the young woman put away her communication artifact and turned an apologetic look to Yang Kai as she slowly shook her head, “This Mistress is really helpless. I don’t know why, but the managers insist that Yue’er cannot be redeemed. Please give up, Young Lord.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai slowly got up and nodded, “Good, since that’s the case, then I won’t embarrass you any further. Just rest here for a while!”</p>
<p>Saying so, he flashed a fierce grin at the young woman.</p>
<p>The young woman’s heart clenched but before she could react, a powerful pressure burst through her Knowledge Sea’s defenses, causing her to suddenly become dizzy.</p>
<p>At the same time, she saw that the young man opposite her flicker and re-appear in front of her, his big hand reaching out towards her. The young woman was thoroughly shocked and wanted to resist, but immediately discovered she was unable to circulate her Saint Qi at all.</p>
<p>She was also a Second-Order Saint King, but when facing Yang Kai, an opponent who was supposedly at the same level, she was unable to fight back at all.</p>
<p>In the next instant, a scalding hot force poured into her body and quickly moved to form an ingenious seal which made it impossible for her to use any of her strength.</p>
<p>The tender body of the young woman went limp as she became unable to even lift her fingers. Only her mouth was still able to move and she hastily called out, “Young Lord, what is the meaning of this? If you dare act unruly in Joyous Union Pavilion, you won’t have a good end!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai grinned before snapping his fingers, causing the young woman to lose the ability to speak as well before he leisurely said, “I’ll be taking her away with me, but I’ll be leaving these items here as agreed, so your noble establishment won’t suffer any kind of loss and instead will be making a big profit. As for your managers... I suggest you check carefully with them after you regain your freedom, perhaps you’ll find a little fool who was intentionally interfering with our transaction. En, after a thorough investigation, I’m certain you won’t be punished.”</p>
<p>The young woman looked at Yang Kai in surprise, not knowing what he was trying to reveal by saying these words.</p>
<p>She wanted to ask for more details, but she was unable to open her mouth, so she could only watch the figures of Yang Kai and Qian Yue disappear from her field of vision. Feeling quite anxious, she forcibly urged a secret technique she had practiced to shatter one of her earrings.</p>
<p>The moment the young woman’s earring burst, Yang Kai immediately noticed and his face changed greatly, shouting under this breath, “Let’s go!”</p>
<p>Saying so, he grabbed Qian Yue’s waist and tried to quickly escape from this place.</p>
<p>“You want to go?” Suddenly, a tender voice with a hint of coldness rang out through the air, “You dare act dissolute in my Joyous Union Pavilion? Don’t even think of leaving!”</p>
<p>As these words fell, an invisible force suddenly enveloped Yang Kai, making him feel as if the surrounding space had solidified, his body which had just leapt up into the air falling down in the next moment.</p>
<p>“Shi!” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. It was not the first time he had experienced this power so he was able to recognize it instantly.</p>
<p>After landing, Yang Kai immediately moved to put Qian Yue savely behind him and looked towards a certain spot. On the other side of his vision stood a beautiful middle-aged woman in a light blue dress that tightly wrapped around her enchanting figure; a stark contrast to the cold gloomy look on her pretty face.</p>
<p>Seeing this middle-aged beauty, Qian Yue’s face changed drastically as she exclaimed, “Manager Lian!”</p>
<p>Hearing Qian Yue’s shout, Yang Kai’s face sank as he felt the situation had become quite troublesome.</p>
<p>Silavin: No. The new translator was someone who was good at translating and just wanted to help out. If you guys did not know him, he was the one who helped translate MP’s Manhwa.</p>
<p>Anyways, he is only able to help out with 6 chapter before needing to serve in the army.</p>
<h2>1318</h2>
<p>Chapter 1318, Manager Lian</p>
<p>When Yang Kai was talking with Qian Yue earlier, he learned that the one who had saved her, brought her back to Joyous Union Pavilion, and taught her this place’s Dual Cultivation Technique was this Manager Lian, a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm master and the most powerful cultivator among the three Origin Realm managers of Joyous Union Pavilion.</p>
<p>Below this woman were two other managers who were at the First-Order Origin Returning Realm.</p>
<p>If it had been one of the two First-Order Origin Returning Realm managers who had blocked his path, Yang Kai would still have confidence in being able to escape with Qian Yue, but facing this Manager Lian, he was far less certain. After all, the difference in their cultivation was an entire Great Realm and, if Yang Kai got tied down here for even a moment, the other two Origin Realm masters would certainly catch-up quickly. At that point, facing three Origin Returning Realm masters alone, and needing to protect Qian Yue at the same time, the result was easy to imagine.</p>
<p>After the last incident in the Corpse Cave, Yang Kai didn’t dare to rashly try to escape by tearing space while bringing along another person.</p>
<p>As various thoughts crossed Yang Kai’s mind, Manager Lian shot a cold glare at Qian Yue and snorted angrily, “Yue’er, your courage isn’t small, actually daring to try to flee here with an outsider. It seems your last punishment wasn’t harsh enough for you to learn!”</p>
<p>Saying so, her Divine Sense pulsed and Qian Yue, who was being protected behind Yang Kai, suddenly let out a cry of pain and her tender body fell to the ground, sweat dripping from her pale face.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression became sullen, but he did not act rashly as he saw that this Manager Lian had simply activated the seal placed on Qian Yue to restrain her rather than take her life.</p>
<p>After a while, Qian Yue’s cries gradually weakened and Manager Lian finally turned her attention from Qian Yue to Yang Kai. A disdainful sneer flashing across her face as she scoffed, “I was wondering who had eaten a bear’s heart and leopard’s gall to gain the courage to dare try to make trouble in my Joyous Union Pavilion, but it turns out to be just a little Saint King Realm brat. Who gave you such nerve? Do you know what the consequences will be?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face remained indifferent as he helped Qian Yue up off the ground. Sweeping her with his Divine Sense, he quickly confirmed that she hadn’t suffered any serious injuries and his expression softened a little. Turning his attention to the beautiful middle-aged woman before him, Yang Kai said lightly, “Manager Lian I presume? I was not trying to escape with her, I had reached a deal with your noble establishment to redeem her. Could it be that after providing payment I cannot take the woman I settled on and leave here? Could it be your noble establishment not only deals in prostitution but also in murdering and robbing?”</p>
<p>“Bold!” The beautiful middle-aged woman’s face went ice cold as she waved her hand and sent out a ray of white light towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>In response, Yang Kai let out a loud roar as black flames burst from his fist and, while fiercely pushing his Saint Qi, sent out a flurry of punches.</p>
<p>Fist shadows visible to the naked eye blasted out, each one containing searing hot energy as they flew to intercept Manager Lian’s attack.</p>
<p>A great rumbling rang out and a blinding explosion of light filled the surrounding darkness of night. The countless fist shadows all collapsed but Manager Lian’s attack also dissipated halfway and was completely dispersed.</p>
<p>Yang Kai remained standing in place, his figure not retreating a single step while Manager Lian’s eyes flashed with a trace of surprise as she stared at the young man in front of her. Although she had not exerted herself fully in the previous attack, she had still used at least thirty percent of her strength, so Yang Kai being able to resist her with ease, even under the influence of her Shi, greatly surprised her.</p>
<p>Forgetting the fact that this young man was just a Second-Order Saint King, even if he had been a peak Saint King it would normally be impossible to accomplish this. Manager Lian had thought that she would at least be able to punish Yang Kai for his brazen words.</p>
<p>Although her blow failed to produce the desired effect, given her status and identity, she was unable to strike a second time, so all she could do was stare at Yang Kai in amazement and uncertainty.</p>
<p>From this brief exchange it was obvious to her that Yang Kai was not an ordinary cultivator, rather he was likely an elite among the elite. Having such strength while only being a Second-Order Saint King meant that this young man’s background was not low. Before she could figure out Yang Kai’s origins, it would be unwise to act rashly lest she provoke a powerful enemy for Joyous Union Pavilion.</p>
<p>The noise from this conflict had naturally alarmed the entire Joyous Union Pavilion.</p>
<p>A moment later, two other First-Order Origin Returning Realm masters rushed to the scene from separate locations. After seeing the scene before them, they were both greatly surprised and quickly gathered around Manager Lian to inquire about the situation.</p>
<p>On the other side, a young man rushed out directly to Yang Kai and asked in a stunned voice, “Brother Yang, what happened?”</p>
<p>Naturally, it was Chen Fan Lei! But looking at the state of his clothes and his still neat and tidy appearance, it was clear he had not yet achieved ‘good things’ before rushing over to see what all the commotion was about.</p>
<p>Yang Kai gave him a wry smile and whispered, “It’s a bit inconvenient to explain right now, I’ll tell you later.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Chen Fan Lei no longer asked anything, but instead quietly glanced over to the other side. After only a brief glance, his heart sank; never had he imagined that his first time entering this kind of pleasure-seeking establishment he would be involved in so much trouble.</p>
<p>The three Origin Returning Realm master managers of Joyous Union Pavilion had all gathered and were staring at Yang Kai, none of them quite knowing how to proceed while from all directions, countless guards of Joyous Union Pavilion had surrounded this place, making for a lively scene.</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei felt tightness in his chest and was in the midst of a deep regret. He felt he really should not have come to this damned place today and gotten into this mess for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>After a short discussion, the three Origin Returning Realm masters seemed to have reached some kind of decision, with Manager Lian taking the initiative to speak to Yang Kai, “You just said you have already redeemed Yue’er, but who was it you made this deal with?”</p>
<p>“Manager Lian, it was I!” The young woman who had been negotiating with Yang Kai suddenly called out.</p>
<p>The seal Yang Kai put on her was not very strong and was only meant to buy him some time, so after a short while she had broken it and regained her freedom. After freeing herself, she hurried over to this place and upon hearing Manager Lian’s question, she did not dare conceal anything and answered immediately.</p>
<p>“Xiao Qing... Are you alright? Did he attack you?” Manager Lian saw that something had happened to this young woman and asked coldly.</p>
<p>“This maid has not been affected greatly, this Young Lord did not act with malicious intent,” The young woman actually put in a good word for Yang Kai, obviously because she was still quite impressed by the offer Yang Kai had just made.</p>
<p>“Even if that’s the case, daring to cause trouble in my Joyous Union Pavilion, he’s clearly looking down on us,” Another old man in azure robes coldly snorted as he turned a bad look towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Manager Wang is correct. Such an incident cannot just be overlooked, but for the time being, tell me about this transaction that boy over there mentioned,” Manager Lian turned to the young woman and asked.</p>
<p>The young woman took a moment to collect her thoughts before carefully explaining the twists and turns that had taken place in her negotiations with Yang Kai. As she narrated this series of events, the three Joyous Union Pavilion managers each showed varying expressions.</p>
<p>When Manager Lian heard the extraordinary price Yang Kai had offered to redeem Qian Yue, she was naturally quite shocked. Although she was still annoyed by Yang Kai’s previous actions, the coldness on her face undoubtedly dissipated a lot.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Manager Wang appeared to think of something, and he seemingly unintentionally shot a glance towards a nearby building, an angry glare flashing across his eyes.</p>
<p>The last Origin Returning Realm manager simply stood by with an indifferent look upon his face.</p>
<p>After the young woman finished speaking, Manager Lian nodded lightly, “Good, according to our establishment’s rules, since this boy was willing to pay such a big price, there was no reason not to agree! You also have the right to complete such a deal. Manager Wang, Manager Xu, which one of you insisted on keeping Yue’er, is there any deep meaning behind this move?”</p>
<p>“This has nothing to do with me, I was in secluded cultivation the whole time,” Manager Xu, who still retained his indifferent expression, shook his head slowly.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Manager Lian set her sights on the old man surnamed Wang.</p>
<p>This man wore a helpless look and was just about to speak when Yang Kai suddenly grinned and cut in, “Perhaps Manager Wang doesn’t know the circumstances of this matter.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” The beautiful middle-aged woman asked coldly.</p>
<p>“Get out here!” Yang Kai suddenly snorted as a Golden Thread shot out from this hand and pierced towards a nearby loft. This Golden Thread flew extremely fast, as if it could leap across space, and in the next instant, a panic filled scream rang out from the targeted building. There was a burst of Saint Qi, but this faded as quickly as it had appeared.</p>
<p>Yang Kai flicked his wrist, and the Golden Thread flew back again, but now, there was a male cultivator that had been tied up at its end and was currently struggling to break free.</p>
<p>“Little brat, you dare!” Seeing this, Manger Wang shouted severely and swiftly raised his hand to attack Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“If you dare to move, I’ll crush him to death!” Yang Kai sneered as the Golden Thread suddenly radiated an extremely dangerous aura.</p>
<p>Manager Wang’s face changed and he didn’t dare act rashly; however, the glare he directed at Yang Kai was still filled with incredible hate, as if he wished to skin him alive.</p>
<p>The Golden Thread flew back leisurely, bringing its captured prey with it.</p>
<p>Manager Lian also showed an astonished look on her face. With her Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation, she had naturally seen what just happened. The cultivator hiding in the nearby loft was a genuine Third-Order Saint King, but facing the assault of this Second-Order Saint King boy in front of her, the other party only managed to resist for a breath of time before he had been captured.</p>
<p>Possessing such extraordinary combat strength, just where did this young man come from? Moreover, the Golden Thread in his hand was also very strange. It seemed like an artifact, but also not, and the aura it revealed made it difficult to not pay attention to.</p>
<p>Manager Lian’s expression grew cloudy as she secretly felt that it was not a good idea to provoke this young man. He likely had an extraordinarily strong background, something far superior to Imperial City Sect.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother Wang!” After Yang Kai captured this man, Chen Fan Lei could not help shouting, staring at the other person in surprise, “Senior Brother Wang, why are you here? Didn’t you have somewhere to go today?”</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han’s expression was incredibly ugly, and he was in no mood to answer Chen Fan Lei’s question, instead turning his attention to the old man surnamed Wang nearby. Opening his mouth, it seemed Wang Yu Han wanted to ask for help, but he was unable to say anything, causing a look of extreme unwillingness to fill his face.</p>
<p>“Also surnamed Wang...” The beautiful middle-aged woman’s eyes flashed, as if she realized something. Turning to the old man surnamed Wang with a smile, she asked, “Manager Wang, how are you and this boy related?”</p>
<h2>1319</h2>
<p>Chapter 1319, Deal</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain &amp; Dhael Ligerkeys</p>
<p>The old man surnamed Wang wore a bitter look but he still replied honestly, “I’ve shown Manager Lian something embarrassing. This boy is one of my descendants and is currently a disciple of Extreme Path Sect. He happened to be visiting Black Crow City and came to visit this old man!”</p>
<p>“Came to visit?” The middle-aged beauty nodded slightly. “It’s good that he is so filial, but... it seems visiting isn’t the only reason he came here. Why is Manager Wang’s manager token in this boy’s possession?”</p>
<p>As she said this, she suddenly waved her hand and an invisible suction force appeared, pulling a token Wang Yu Han had in his sleeve over to her. It was the token Manager Wang had given Wang Yu Han before.</p>
<p>The old man surnamed Wang’s complexion instantly filled with resentment.</p>
<p>He did not know that Wang Yu Han would act so stupidly, actually daring to use his manager token to impersonate him and order the young woman called Xiao Qing to block a profitable transaction for Joyous Union Pavilion. If he had known this would happen, how could he have so easily handed Wang Yu Han this token?</p>
<p>Manager Wang had not wanted to personally intervene in the matters of his juniors, so he had made an exception and given his grand-nephew some extra authority to handle things himself.</p>
<p>But now that something like this had happened, and it had even alarmed this beautiful middle-aged woman, the situation was not going to end well.</p>
<p>Facing the middle-aged beauty’s question, the old man surnamed Wang did not know how to answer and could only remain silent. Manager Lian was a worldly woman, so after a little thought she had a fairly good idea of what was happening, but this only caused her expression to grow colder. Sending a Divine Sense Message to Manager Wang, she scolded, “I don’t care what kind of grievance your descendant has with that boy, but allowing an outsider to interfere in Joyous Union Pavilion’s business, and even hindering such a high-level transaction, you should know what the consequences of this will be!”</p>
<p>Manager Wang’s heart sank as his expression grew even more bitter.</p>
<p>The beautiful middle-aged woman snorted and continued with another Divine Sense Message, “Seeing how everything has already happened, it would be inappropriate for me to continue rebuking you in front of outsiders. The price this boy has offered is not low, so as long as he still wants to take Yue’er away, this deal can still be done! Manager Wang, this time your punishment will be a year’s worth of salary, do you have any opinion?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t dare, I will abide by whatever Manager Lian decides!” The old man surnamed Wang heard this and finally relaxed somewhat.</p>
<p>“Moreover, don’t let your descendant ever set foot into Joyous Union Pavilion again, otherwise don’t blame this Mistress for being acting impolitely!” The middle-aged beauty issued another warning and received a prompt nod from Manager Wang.</p>
<p>This Divine Sense exchange was naturally not missed by Yang Kai, and although he did not know what exactly these two were discussing, considering the current situation, it seemed things weren’t going to be too bad. Seeing that there was still plenty of room to manoeuvre, Yang Kai’s expression immediately relaxed.</p>
<p>After a moment, the middle-aged beauty finished dealing with Manager Wang and turned her eyes to Yang Kai, a light smile forming at the corner of her lips, “Boy, although the price you offered was quite attractive, enough to redeem Yue’er, it’s still the case that before the deal was completed you tried to force your way out with her and even took action against Xiao Qing. It seems you don’t take this Mistress or my noble establishment seriously.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression flashed as he broke into a grin and cupped his fists, “Junior’s previous actions were indeed reckless, I can only hope that several Seniors will be broadminded. Ms Xiao Qing, I also apologize for raising my hand against you.”</p>
<p>With his shrewdness, how could Yang Kai not see that the previous obstruction was all due to Wang Yu Han severely overstepping his authority? The beautiful middle-aged woman was obviously very satisfied with the price he offered, so now the only trouble was how to compensate for the damage Yang Kai had done to Joyous Union Pavilion’s face. After all, there were currently many guests who had come here seeking pleasure who had been attracted by this disturbance and were now observing curiously.</p>
<p>If Manager Lian really let him go just like that, her dignity and the dignity of the other managers would be completely lost. The other party needed a way to de-escalate the situation and to preserve face, so Yang Kai was naturally willing to cooperate with them.</p>
<p>Seeing him being so cooperative, the smile on the middle-aged beauty’s face became thirty percent brighter, but she still turned her head to look at the young woman named Xiao Qing and asked solemnly, “Xiao Qing, what do you think? No matter what he says, this boy attacked you just now. If you want me to teach him a lesson, just say the word and guarantee he won’t feel better.”</p>
<p>The young woman glanced over Yang Kai before replying in a low voice, “Although this Young Lord indeed acted against me just now, he did not cause any harm and only slightly restricted my freedom. Manager Lian can decide how to process this matter.”</p>
<p>“Good!” The middle-aged beauty nodded in satisfaction, pondered for a while, then turned to Yang Kai, “The transaction you discussed is still valid, but the content of the deal must be modified.”</p>
<p>“Modified?” Yang Kai raised his brow.</p>
<p>“En, I won’t ask you to pay a greater price, so as to avoid others saying I am using my strength to bully you, and since you are so determined to take Yue’er away with you, obviously you truly love her. So, I won’t try to come between such a happy couple, but the items you used as collateral will now become the chips for this transaction. You need not try to redeem them anymore. This will suffice as the penalty for your actions just now. After this deal is completed, Yue’er and my Joyous Union Pavilion will no longer have any involvement with one another, and my Joyous Union Pavilion will not seek trouble with you in the future!” The beautiful woman stared at Yang Kai with a smile. Obviously, the two bottles of Origin Grade pills he had used as collateral were of great interest to her.</p>
<p>“This...” Yang Kai immediately wore an awkward and hesitant expression.</p>
<p>“What? Do you want to disagree?” The beautiful woman’s face went cold. “If so, then this deal will be invalidated, Yue’er will remain, and we’ll need to have a little chat about the disrespect you’ve shown my noble establishment.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face twitched before he put on a forced smile and declared firmly, “Senior must be joking, this Junior is very satisfied with Senior’s proposal, how could I dare disagree? Such being the case, everything will be done in accordance with Senior’s will, but before that, this Junior has a small another request!”</p>
<p>Seeing Yang Kai really agree, a happy light flashed across the depths of the beautiful woman’s eyes, but she still wore a sullen look as she snapped, “Boy, don’t reach out for a yard after taking an inch.”</p>
<p>“For Senior, this request will only take a slight effort,” Yang Kai responded calmly.</p>
<p>“Very well, but let me warn you, if you have some kind of excessive request, you need not open your mouth.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai laughed lightly, “This Junior simply wants to request Senior lift the seal on Lady Yue’er.”</p>
<p>“If that is all, then I can accommodate you!” The beautiful woman nodded lightly. After all, the seal on Qian Yue’s body was planted by her, so how could lifting it be any trouble? “Yue’er, come here!”</p>
<p>Qian Yue looked at Yang Kai subconsciously but upon seeing him nod to her, she slowly walked over to Manager Lian.</p>
<p>Yang Kai stood by and calmly waited.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, Yang Kai could break a seal a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm created, but it would take him a fair amount of time and energy. Also, while he was breaking this seal, he would need to have some close physical contact with Qian Yue, which would undoubtedly be awkward for both of them. Now that an opportunity to have it lifted had appeared, Yang Kai was naturally going to take advantage of it. Judging from his performance just now, the people from Joyous Union Pavilion probably felt they had won a huge advantage just now so Manager Lian had agreed to this request quite easily.</p>
<p>Lifting the seal did not take long and after just a half cup of tea’s time, Qian Yue returned with a happy face. Seeing the questioning look in Yang Kai’s eyes, she nodded quickly to indicate that the seal had been completely lifted.</p>
<p>“Good, this matter ends here! Boy, take Yue’er and quickly leave. Be kind to her, if you dare make her do anything dangerous in the future, I will certainly not let you off!” The middle-aged beauty gestured towards the exit.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not know how much sincerity was behind her last words, but he figured she was just trying to create some goodwill. In any case, a few words did not cost her anything.</p>
<p>Bringing Qian Yue and Chen Fan Lei with him, Yang Kai took his leave.</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han also wanted to go, but under the watchful eyes of Manager Lian, he did not dare to move, only able to turn to his Senior with a pleading look on his face.</p>
<p>Manager Wang was completely furious now, however, and was unable to even protect himself, so how could he have the leisure to care about Wang Yu Han?</p>
<p>After Yang Kai and his group left, the beautiful woman coldly snorted and ordered, “Manager Wang, bring your descendant and come with me. We need to have a thorough discussion of this time’s matter.”</p>
<p>In front of outsiders, it was inconvenient for her to rip this old man surnamed Wang’s face. However, she still needed to hold him accountable.</p>
<p>Manager Wang wore a bitter look but still nodded compliantly, glaring at Wang Yu Han fiercely before following after the middle-aged beauty.</p>
<p>Back at Flying Spirit Palace, Yang Kai and his group quickly returned to the Floating Snow Moon Pavilion.</p>
<p>Along the way, Chen Fan Lei kept looking at Qian Yue curiously. He really wanted to know how Yang Kai and him, who had gone out for a little fun, had wound up actually bringing a woman back. And from what he had heard just now in Joyous Union Pavilion, it seemed that in order to bring back this woman, Yang Kai had paid a huge price.</p>
<p>Was there something special about this woman? Chen Fan Lei was very puzzled.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had no intention of giving him an explanation, and Qian Yue only followed Yang Kai silently, enjoying her newly regained freedom while secretly feeling shocked at Yang Kai’s growth and wealth.</p>
<p>When she first met Yang Kai, his cultivation had been several steps lower than her own, but now, he had surpassed her. Moreover, back at Joyous Union Pavilion, he had taken Manager Lian’s attack and come out unscathed, so he was undoubtedly among the strongest Saint Kings out there.</p>
<p>As for the price to redeem her, Qian Yue did not even dare to think about it.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had left Tong Xuan Realm and entered the Star Field later than she had, so how did he manage to achieve such astonishing growth in strength and accumulate so much wealth in such a short period of time? Qian Yue felt truly shocked.</p>
<p>As soon as the trio arrived at Floating Snow Moon Pavilion, they saw Chen Shi Tao and Lu Ying chatting on the first floor under Yang Yan’s hospitality, but from Yang Yan’s stiff expression, it was obvious she wasn’t good at handling such matters, so when Yang Kai returned, her eyes lit up and she quickly called out, “You’re back? Sister Chen and Sister Lu Ying have been waiting for you for more than an hour here.”</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing, it was just that Fan Lei wasn’t in his room, so I came here to look for him as it seemed he had come here to see Little Brother Yang a while ago. Oh, who is she?” Chen Shi Tao suddenly saw Qian Yue and asked with a confused expression.</p>
<h2>1320</h2>
<p>Chapter 1320, A Little Talk About Life</p>
<p>Facing Chen Shi Tao’s enquiry, Yang Kai only vaguely explained that Qian Yue was an old acquaintance. Even if she had her doubts, Chen Shi Tao wasn’t silly enough to interrogate him further.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yang Yan’s pair of beautiful eyes stared at Qian Yue thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao and the others may not be clear about Yang Kai’s origins, but Yang Yan was.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had come from the outside world, and wasn’t even a native of Shadowed Star, yet now he had said this woman was actually an old acquaintance. Did that mean that this First-Order Saint King woman also came from the outside world?</p>
<p>Little did she expect that Qian Yue not only came from the outside world but even from the same place as Yang Kai.</p>
<p>After the host and guests were seated, Chen Shi Tao immediately began to ask Chen Fan Lei where he had gone and why he was out so late. Chen Fan Lei’s face turned bright red and he immediately turned to Yang Kai for help, really not sure how to explain himself.</p>
<p>He couldn’t exactly tell his big sister that while feeling bored tonight, he had decided to come over and invite Yang Kai to a brothel. If he were to really tell the truth, receiving a reprimand would be unavoidable.</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Fan Lei clam up so awkwardly, Chen Shi Tao seemed to guess something and turned to look at Yang Kai with a smile, “Little Brother Yang, where did you and Fan Lei go tonight? And why is there a somewhat obscene scent lingering about you?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced over at Chen Fan Lei, saw him silently begging him not to say anything, and smiled bitterly, “Brother Chen, if none of the twists and turns of tonight had happened, staying silent would be fine, but after such a big commotion, trying to hide things is probably impossible. You should just tell the truth.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Chen Fan Lei’s head immediately drooped.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a while, he gritted his teeth and explained what happened tonight.</p>
<p>After hearing that they really had gone to a pleasure house, Chen Shi Tao’s pretty face froze over, but once she learned about all the twists and turns her little brother and Yang Kai experienced, as well as how Wang Yu Han had been creating trouble from the shadows she couldn’t help feeling startled. After learning about the hidden dangers of the Dual Cultivation Technique of Joyous Union Pavilion from Yang Kai, her beautiful face lost all colour and she hurriedly asked, “Fan Lei, you didn’t really...”</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei waved his hands frantically, “No, no! Thanks to Brother Yang’s warning, I only had a little talk about life with that girl, besides that, nothing else happened.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Lu Ying couldn’t stop herself from giggling and even Chen Shi Tao, who was still quite annoyed and worried, had a hard time stifling her laughter.</p>
<p>Entering such an establishment and paying a great sum of money yet not actually engaging in the act and instead discussing life with the young woman accompanying him, it was likely only Chen Fan Lei had ever done such a thing. The girl who accompanied Chen Fan Lei was probably completely confused even now.</p>
<p>However, hearing that events had played out like this, Chen Shi Tao was finally able to relax.</p>
<p>After pondering for a while, her beautiful eyes flashed as she said, “So in short, the reason Fan Lei decided to go to that kind of place was that Wang Yu Han’s unintentionally mentioned it? And you brought Little Brother Yang along just to give you a bit more courage?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if he had mentioned it unintentionally, but Wang Yu Han arriving at Joyous Union Pavilion in advance and targeting and obstructing me at every turn is definitely true,” Yang Kai said lightly.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao’s face changed slightly as she thought out loud, “Wang Yu Han should have a good understanding of Fan Lei’s character, and also know what kind of effect his words would have. It seems that his ultimate goal was Little Brother Yang, while Fan Lei was just a pawn. How hateful, to deal with Little Brother Yang, he didn’t even care about ruining Fan Lei’s future! What kind of Senior Brother is he? If he had really succeeded, wouldn’t Fan Lei have been unable to advance a single step further?”</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han’s actions this time had touched Chen Shi Tao’s reverse scale, causing her to become livid as a cold light flashed across her eyes.</p>
<p>“Fan Lei, don’t have any dealings with him in the future. After returning to Extreme Path Sect, you must also report this matter to your Master.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I still have to tell Master about going to Joyous Union Pavilion...” Chen Fan Lei hesitated suddenly.</p>
<p>“Naturally you must explain everything to him! Or what, you don’t want to? If you don’t want to, I’ll come with you to Extreme Path Sect and tell him myself!” Chen Shi Tao narrowed her eyes as she glared at her little brother.</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei didn’t dare to refuse and could only helplessly nod.</p>
<p>After this incident came to light, even if Wang Yu Han wasn’t expelled from Extreme Path Sect, a heavy punishment would be unavoidable; however, the former was far more likely.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao remained angry for a while before suddenly remembering something, shedding her annoyed expression, and bowing to Yang Kai elegantly, “This time it was fortunate Little Brother Yang was around, otherwise, that bastard’s plot might have succeeded. This Young Lady offers her sincerest thanks.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai simply waved his hand and said, “It was likely I who implicated Brother Chen in this matter, it’s not his fault! En, since things have reached this point, there’s nothing more to say about this incident, but I should inform Sister Chen about a certain matter.”</p>
<p>“What matter? Please speak freely Little Brother Yang.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai flipped his hand and suddenly a piece of dried up dead wood appeared on his palm. This piece of wood was completely black and did not have any distinctive smell or aura to it, as if it was just an ordinary piece of dead wood one could find anywhere.</p>
<p>“Does Sister Chen know what this thing is?” Yang Kai asked.</p>
<p>“This is...” Chen Shi Tao frowned as she observed this piece of dead wood hesitantly, as if she recognized it but couldn’t put a name to it.</p>
<p>“Huh, isn’t this Beast Attracting Incense?” Chen Fan Lei called out in surprise.</p>
<p>“It seems that Brother Chen recognizes this, so you should also know where it came from, yes?” Yang Kai looked at him.</p>
<p>“En, I used this kind of thing with Senior Brother Wang before to lure out Monster Beasts that were good at concealing themselves. It is quite useful actually. As long as one burns a small portion of it, it can attract any nearby Monster Beasts. It’s odourless and we cultivators can’t detect any aura from it though,” Chen Fan Lei explained, “It turns out Brother Yang also has this kind of Beast Attracting Incense on him. Oh, it looks like it’s already been burnt slightly, where did Brother Yang obtain it?”</p>
<p>“I picked it up in Grand Burial Valley, next to the Thunder Pond!” Yang Kai smiled slightly.</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei wore an expression of surprise, but Chen Shi Tao’s eyes flashed a thoughtful light, her expression soon changing to one of shock as she stared at Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Actually, this thing wasn’t found by me, but by Yang Yan. When she was collecting the Thunder Liquid, she accidentally discovered it. If it wasn’t for Yang Yan having a broad knowledge of strange items, she might have missed it!” Yang Kai handed the Beast Attracting Incense over to Chen Shi Tao before turning to Chen Fan Lei and asking, “Brother Chen, it’s not that I wish to come off overly suspicious and pessimistic, but I have to ask whether your Senior Brother Wang visited that Thunder Pond before?”</p>
<p>“Little Brother Yang’s meaning is...” Chen Shi Tao narrowed her eyes sharply.</p>
<p>“Since Sister Chen already understands, why bother asking?” Yang Kai smiled faintly.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao gently nodded before turning to her little brother. “Fan Lei, has Wang Yu Han been to that Thunder Pond before?”</p>
<p>“En, he has. A few years ago, he accompanied another Senior Brother there. That Senior Brother also cultivated the same Secret Art as I and at that time wanted to use the Thunder Pond to achieve a breakthrough. It was because of that previous experience that Senior Brother Wang proposed we go there for my breakthrough,” Chen Fan Lei scratched his head in confusion, “Why? What’s the problem?”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao ground her teeth in anger as she muttered in a cold voice, “It seems falling into distress at the Thunder Pond this time was something Wang Yu Han plotted from the beginning.”</p>
<p>“It can’t be,” Chen Fan Lei exclaimed, “Why should Senior Brother Wang do that? If Brother Yang hadn’t arrived in time, he would probably have lost his life!”</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao shook her head, “I don’t know the specific situation, but if I were to guess, when Wang Yu Han went to the Thunder Pond a few years ago, he should have discovered that Silver Night Thunder Beast as a peak Eighth-Order Monster Beast. You must have noticed that Silver Night Thunder Beast had only reached the Ninth-Order recently. This was something Wang Yu Han didn’t anticipate, which caused us to fall into such a dangerous situation! As for why he did all this...”</p>
<p>“Probably to create a dangerous situation he could take advantage of to play the hero rescuing a beauty and win her heart,” Yang Kai chuckled, finishing off what Chen Shi Tao didn’t say.</p>
<p>Chen Shi Tao’s face turned red before shooting a glare towards Yang Kai, but she didn’t try to deny his assertion, obviously agreeing with his guess.</p>
<p>Hearing all this, Chen Fan Lei wore a look of pure shock, murmuring out loud, “How could Senior Brother Wang do this?”</p>
<p>The danger at the Thunder Pond, the incident at Joyous Union Pavilion, all of it had been the result of Wang Yu Han’s scheming, something that Chen Fan Lei found difficult to accept for a while.</p>
<p>“Fan Lei, you have too little experience in the real world and aren’t able to recognize the true nature of others, so it’s understandable you were deceived. However, in the future, you must think more deeply about such matters. This time you were fortunate enough to meet a noble person like Little Brother Yang, but next time, your luck might not be so good,” Chen Shi Tao warned her naive little brother sincerely.</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei nodded subconsciously.</p>
<p>While Chen Shi Tao educated Chen Fan Lei, Yang Kai kept silent. In fact, he had not planned on exposing this Beast Attracting Incense at first; after all, Wang Yu Han taking such actions were simply because he was desperate to pursue this beauty, so it wasn’t as if he had malicious intentions.</p>
<p>But what happened tonight had made Yang Kai extremely unhappy, so he wasn’t going to be polite with Wang Yu Han anymore.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t mind trampling over this petty and narrow-minded man.</p>
<p>With something like this having happened, Chen Shi Tao didn’t have the mood to stay any longer, so she took Lu Ying and Chen Fan Lei and left Floating Snow Moon Pavilion to return to their own loft, preparing to thoroughly discipline Chen Fan Lei.</p>
<p>After they left, Yang Kai turned to Qian Yue and said, “Have a rest here for now, it will be two days before we leave.”</p>
<p>He then introduced Yang Yan and Qian Yue to each other. After learning that Qian Yue was actually from the same Star as Yang Kai, Yang Yan was also taken aback and became quite curious about the circumstances behind this situation. When facing Chen Shi Tao, Yang Yan’s attitude was neither hot nor cold, but when facing Qian Yue, a woman she had just met, she was actually quite friendly and enthusiastically invited her back to her room.</p>
<p>Qian Yue happened to want to ask about Yang Kai’s situation as well, so she naturally didn’t refuse.</p>
<p>Exhausted from all the unexpected twists and turns he had to deal with tonight, Yang Kai retired to his room alone to rest.</p>
<p>For the next two days, Yang Kai stayed inside the Floating Snow Moon Pavilion, spending his time meditating while, whereas, the relationship between Qian Yue and Yang Yan seemed to become much more harmonious.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until mid-day of the third day that one of the maidservants of Flying Spirit Palace came to report that Chen Shi Tao and the others had come to see him. Yang Kai heard this and immediately sent a Divine Sense Message to Qian Yue and Yang Yan, gathering with them before proceeding downstairs.</p>

<p>Chapter 1321, Ambush</p>

<p>Chen Shi Tao brought good news. The Origin Returning Realm Senior who Chen Fan Lei knew had returned from his mission and when Chen Fan Lei went to ask him this morning about using the Space Array, the other party had readily agreed. Now that Black Crow City’s Space Array was open to them, Yang Kai could travel to Heavenly Fate City at any time.</p>
<p>Moreover, all the expenses accrued by Yang Kai and his group to use the Space Array were paid for by Chen Fan Lei.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was not surprised by this; after all, the Chen Family brother and sister both had a deep sense of gratitude towards him, so a few trivial Saint Crystals were nothing to them. Yang Kai kindly accepted their generosity before he, Yang Yan, and Qian Yue followed Chen Shi Tao to the Black Crow City Space Array.</p>
<p>The Space Array of any city had many layers of protection around it and was overseen by numerous experts, Black Crow City was naturally no exception.</p>
<p>Upon entering the hall where the Space Array was located, Yang Kai immediately noticed that there were at least four Origin Returning Realm masters concealing themselves nearby. Beside the Space Array, a middle-aged man dressed in scholarly robes stood waiting, who, upon seeing Chen Fan Lei, smiled and nodded lightly. Apparently, the relationship between these two was quite good.</p>
<p>Yang Kai immediately understood that this middle-aged scholar was the Senior Chen Shi Tao had mentioned.</p>
<p>Leading Yang Kai and his group over, Chen Fan Lei greeted the middle-aged man before hurriedly saying with a smile, “Brother Yang, it seems everything has been prepared.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your hard work, Brother Chen!” Yang Kai cupped his fists politely before walking over to the Space Array with him.</p>
<p>Chen Fan Lei pointed to the middle-aged man and introduced him, “This is Senior Jiang Wen Jie. Being able to use the Space Array so easily this time is all thanks to Senior Jiang’s assistance.”</p>
<p>“Many thanks, Senior Jiang.” Yang Kai gently nodded to the middle-aged man.</p>
<p>The other party looked Yang Kai up and down and smiled slightly, “Sure enough, a heroic young man. Nephew Yang looks quite young but like Nephew Chen, is already a Second-Order Saint King. It seems a promising future awaits you.”</p>
<p>Jiang Wen Jie only said this out of consideration for Chen Fan Lei’s face. Yang Kai didn’t have a deep relationship with this Senior, but receiving such praise, he still acted humble.</p>
<p>Immediately, Jiang Wen Jie ordered people to open the Space Array, and after Yang Kai said goodbye to the Chen sister and brother, he led Yang Yan and Qian Yue onto the platform.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the Space Array began to glow and Space Force fluctuations appeared. Just as the figures of Yang Kai’s group of three began to blur though, Jiang Wen Jie suddenly looked at Yang Kai and mouthed something silently.</p>
<p>A ray of light flashed across Yang Kai’s eyes, but it was too late for him to ask anything as a slight dizziness overcame him.</p>
<p>On a Space Array platform hundreds of thousands of kilometres away from Black Crow City, Yang Kai and his group appeared.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had cultivated Space Force, so this long-distance teleportation did not affect him greatly. He could even use this transmission to gain some small insight into the Dao of Space.</p>
<p>However, neither Yang Yan nor Qian Yue could ignore the side-effects of such a teleportation and felt quite dizzy after emerging from The Void. After circulating their Saint Qi a bit though, this fit of discomfort eased.</p>
<p>Sweeping her eyes over their surroundings, Yang Yan’s expression quickly became puzzled while Qian Yue called out in surprise, “Is this Heavenly Fate City? Why is there no one here?”</p>
<p>“This isn’t Heavenly Fate City!” Yang Kai said in a solemn tone, finally understanding what Jiang Wen Jie’s last minute warning to be careful meant.</p>
<p>Looking around, although they were indeed in a grand hall with a Space Array platform beneath their feet, everything seemed quite run down and clearly did not match with the Heavenly Fate City hall in their memory. This place was clearly a deserted ruin!</p>
<p>“Correct, this is not Heavenly Fate City!” An eerie voice suddenly called out from nearby. Qian Yue and Yang Yan were startled and simultaneously turned their heads in the direction the voice came from. There, a familiar person, wearing a look of self-satisfaction upon his face, was strolling over towards their group. However, when this man’s eyes landed on Yang Kai, a look of deep hatred and anger replaced his smug expression.</p>
<p>Seeing this man’s face, Yang Kai understood everything and grinning towards him said, “Brother Wang, we meet again! The world is far too small!”</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han laughed loudly, “I’ve been waiting for you, this is the place I specifically chose for your grave. I hope Brother Yang is satisfied.”</p>
<p>“En, not bad at all, this place is a good spot to make a grave, but whether it will be mine or yours is still uncertain!” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as he coldly snorted and shouted, “Manager Wang, since you’ve come as well, stop hiding and come out.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Yang Kai turned to look at a certain spot in these ruins.</p>
<p>An old man with a dark expression on his face slowly appeared from behind the crumbled walls, followed closely by several other Saint King Realm cultivators, all of them glaring at Yang Kai menacingly while occasionally shooting obscene looks towards Qian Yue.</p>
<p>Seeing this situation, Qian Yue’s face went pale. How could she not understand that these people had been waiting here in ambush for them? Although she did not know much about the specific course of events, she vaguely guessed that these people had somehow meddled with the Space Array they just used.</p>
<p>“Young kids really know how to boast, completely ignorant of how high the Heavens are!” The old man surnamed Wang coldly snorted.</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han laughed wildly as he glared fiercely, “Yang Kai, I bet you didn’t think things would end up like this, but it’s far too late to regret now.”</p>
<p>“Regret? You think far too highly of yourself,” Yang Kai shot him a look of indifference. Not seeing any of the fear he had expected, Wang Yu Han could not help feeling surprised. He thought for sure Yang Kai would break down in a panic, maybe even get down on his knees and beg for mercy, that way he could torture and humiliate him to vent his anger. How could Wang Yu Han have anticipated that even in this situation, it would not cause the slightest bit of change in Yang Kai’s demeanor?</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai knew that Wang Yu Han would not be willing to simply let these matters drop, he hadn’t expected to be redirected to this abandoned city via the Black Crow City Space Array.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had thought that with his group of three teleporting directly from Black Crow City to Heavenly Fate City, even if Wang Yu Han wanted to retaliate against him, he wouldn’t have any opportunity to do so, not that Yang Kai was afraid of him in the first place.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had not expected that his group would be sent here, nor did he expect that this old man surnamed Wang’s status was great enough that he could get the authorities of Black Crow City to cooperate with him. Jiang Wen Jie must have known something like this would happen so he had given Yang Kai a warning at the last moment as a way of giving face to Chen Fan Lei. As for whether Yang Kai and his group lived or died, he probably did not care; after all, there was no friendship between them.</p>
<p>“Wasting time here will just cause more problems later. Go!” Manager Wang saw Yang Kai acting so calmly and inexplicably felt a hint of discomfort in his heart, decisively waving his hand as he shouted, “This little brat is a bit unusual, I’ll deal with him personally, you lot take care of the two women behind him. That Yue’er still has her innocence and has cultivated Joyous Union Pavilion’s special Dual Cultivation Technique, she will be of great benefit to several of you, as for the other girl...”</p>
<p>“I want her!” Wang Yu Han smiled coldly.</p>
<p>“Good, Young Master Wang will have her!” The several Saint Kings behind Manager Wang nodded in agreement before turning their wicked gazes towards Qian Yue, causing her to feel both fearful and angry.</p>
<p>“Since you all court death, I’ll fulfill your wishes!” Yang Kai shouted as he pushed his Saint Qi, condensing a layer of black flame around his body, turning himself into a human fireball as a strange aura pulsed from him.</p>
<p>Immediately after, Yang Kai formed a black sword in his hand and, with a single swing, sent out a powerful sword wave towards the enemy.</p>
<p>“Daring to show off with mere paltry tricks!” The old man surnamed Wang saw Yang Kai dared to take the initiative and flew into a rage, shouting angrily as an invisible power suddenly spread out from his body.</p>
<p>Under the influence of this force, the sword wave which Yang Kai shot off immediately slowed down, as if it had sunk into a quagmire, even some scraping sounds could be heard as it tried to advance through this thickened space.</p>
<p>Although Manager Wang was just a First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, he had been immersed in this cultivation realm for many years and had piled up some understanding of the application of Shi. He wanted to use this opportunity to swiftly suppress Yang Kai’s arrogance.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Wang Yu Han and the several other Saint Kings looked overjoyed and were just about to act when suddenly, the black sword wave distorted and transformed into a number of lifelike serpents. These snakes immediately regained their full speed and rushed out towards these Saint Kings.</p>
<p>“Yuan Control Mastery!” The old man surnamed Wang’s eyes bulged as he shouted in surprise, immediately increasing the power he was putting into his Shi by thirty percent.</p>
<p>At the same time, Wang Yu Han and the others quickly assumed a defensive stance.</p>
<p><em>Hong Hong Hong...</em></p>
<p>With a series of explosions, the blocked black snakes burst apart and Demonic Flames splashed about. Although these flames were unable to cause any harm, they still left all of the enemy Saint Kings in quite a distressed state, many of them wearing terrified looks on their faces now.</p>
<p>Manager Wang had also gone pale!</p>
<p>Taking his status into consideration, and having received a request from Wang Yu Han, Manager Wang had not immediately taken action to kill Yang Kai and was only planning on constraining him slightly, allowing his grand nephew to obtain his revenge personally. How could Manager Wang have anticipated that this brief moment of carelessness had resulted in his grand nephew suffering such a big loss?</p>
<p>Yuan Control Mastery was an extremely profound ability, not something Saint King Realm cultivators were supposed to be able to use at all. Only when one reached the Origin Realm and gained comprehension of Shi would they be able to display Yuan Control Mastery.</p>
<p>But today, Manager Wang had witnessed a mere Second-Order Saint King break this convention; how could he not be shocked?</p>
<p>On top of that, the black flames this little brat used were quite unusual. When Manager Wang used his Divine Sense to investigate these black flames, he felt an aura from them that frightened him greatly and realized that being contaminated with them would lead to very bad consequences.</p>
<p>He did not dare underestimate Yang Kai again and quickly strengthened his Shi, suppressing Yang Kai and his group. Yang Yan and Qian Yue, who were standing behind Yang Kai, both let out a gasp as they felt invisible shackles lock them in place, making it impossible for them to move or even circulate their Saint Qi.</p>
<h2>1322</h2>
<p>Chapter 1322, Fighting An Origin Returning Realm Master</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain &amp; Dhael Ligerkeys</p>
<p>Facing the full might of an Origin Realm master, Yang Kai was naturally affected and his body froze in place. At the same time, a barrage of attacks was rapidly approaching as Wang Yu Han and the other Saint Kings had taken advantage of this opening to act. These Martial Skills and artifact attacks each contained frightening power and seemed intent on killing Yang Kai on the spot.</p>
<p>As long as Yang Kai died, the two women behind him would pose no threat.</p>
<p>With this wave of attacks closing in, Yang Kai’s thoughts made the Purple Shield appear in his hand. The shield’s two attributes burst out and, in a flash, a small sandstorm formed around Yang Kai’s trio, completely shielding their bodies!</p>
<p>A loud noise rang out as the wave of attacks impacted the sandstorm, but none of them were able to penetrate its defences and they were all quickly swallowed up and disappeared.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Wang Yu Han’s expression went cold. In Grand Burial Valley, he had seen Yang Kai use this Origin Grade High-Rank shield artifact and realized how extraordinary it was, but now that he had personally attacked it, he further understood how outstanding its defensive capabilities were.</p>
<p>With such a defensive artifact, as long as the cultivator wielding it didn’t run out of Saint Qi, it would be impossible for the few Saint Kings here to break through its defences. It could be said that wrapped in this sandstorm, Yang Kai and his companions were invincible.</p>
<p>“Excellent!” The old man surnamed Wang’s eyes flashed as a look of greed filled his face, excitedly declaring, “This old master wants that artifact!”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he condensed a huge palm from his Saint Qi and stretched out his hand to grab towards the spot where Yang Kai stood, its five fingers appearing as imposing as mountains, like it could grasp the entire world.</p>
<p>At the same time, an almost imperceptible golden light suddenly flew out from the sandstorm and quickly transformed into several golden threads that began cutting through the air.</p>
<p>The huge Saint Qi palm condensed by Manager Wang lasted less than a breath before it was chopped to pieces by these Golden Threads, disappearing along with them in the next instant.</p>
<p>Before Wang Yu Han and the Saint Kings beside him could react though, these Golden Threads reappeared in front of them and wove together to form a massive net that threatened to engulf them.</p>
<p>“Be careful!” The old man surnamed Wang hurriedly warned as he concentrated his Shi towards these golden threads.</p>
<p>But to his horror, these golden threads seemed completely unaffected by his Shi and instead began cutting it apart before it could completely condense.</p>
<p>“Impossible!” Manager Wang’s expression changed dramatically, suddenly seeming to remember something in the next moment and called out in horror, “Demon Blood Thread! This is the Demon Blood Thread Secret Technique of Demon Blood Temple! You’re from Demon Blood Temple?!”</p>
<p>He finally remembered the origin of this golden thread, but according to what he knew, the Demon Blood Thread was not golden, instead it should have been blood red.</p>
<p>The Demon Blood Thread Secret Technique was famous across all Shadowed Star as it was one of the few techniques that could cut through Shi.</p>
<p>“Whether I’m from Demon Blood Temple or not doesn’t matter!” Yang Kai’s figure hidden in the sandstorm called out indifferently. Flicking his finger, which was connected to his Golden Thread, he swiftly captured the several enemy Saint King Realm cultivators together with Wang Yu Han.</p>
<p>At the same time, Yang Kai sent out a faint signal with his Divine Sense, seemingly issuing a vague command.</p>
<p>Wang Yu Han and the others were all at least Second-Order Saint Kings and their strengths were certainly not weak, but seeing the look of panic on Manager Wang’s face, they knew that this Golden Thread was extremely dangerous so each of them immediately put all their strength into defending themselves, with two of them even using secret techniques in order to avoid getting caught.</p>
<p>But to their shock, before they could fully act, a sudden and sharp pain radiated from their Knowledge Seas, disrupting their concentration and movements for a moment and causing them to fail in fully condensing their Saint Qi or activating their artifacts. The result was them only being able to watch as the Golden Thread net enveloped them.</p>
<p>A loud slicing sound rang out as the Golden Threads flickered back and forth before they were swiftly retrieved by Yang Kai.</p>
<p>However, the several Saint King Realm cultivators, Wang Yu Han included, stood motionless, their eyes filled with terror, as if they had just witnessed something impossible.</p>
<p>“Yu Han!” The old man surnamed Wang cried out in alarm.</p>
<p>“Seventh Grandfa...” Wang Yu Han opened his mouth to respond, a look of desperation on his face, but before he could finish his sentence, his body was suddenly torn apart and turned into a pile of minced meat and fresh blood.</p>
<p>The other Saint Kings shared the same fate as Wang Yu Han, all of them shattering like broken mirrors, their wounds all extremely clean and smooth, as if they had been cut by an incredibly sharp weapon.</p>
<p>With just one blow, every Saint King Realm cultivator here had fallen.</p>
<p>The scene was terrifying, and a rich bloody smell quickly filled the air.</p>
<p>The old man surnamed Wang stood in place, staring at the spot where Wang Yu Han had been killed, his eyes flashing with rage as he saw the neatly severed limbs and shredded flesh.</p>
<p>He simply could not accept this scene.</p>
<p>The opponent was just a Second-Order Saint King, so how was he able to kill so many cultivations at or above his realm in an instant? This made Manager Wang wonder if he was seeing some kind of illusion as he simply couldn’t believe his eyes. After staring for a while at this though, he grit his teeth and turned his gaze towards Yang Kai, “Boy, you dare kill my grand nephew! Speak, what kind of dirty trick did you use?!”</p>
<p>“Dirty trick?” Yang Kai sneered as he waved his hand to disperse the sandstorm shielding him, revealing himself again. Shooting a disdainful glance over at the old man, he said lightly, “When you die, you’ll understand.”</p>
<p>“Ignorant child, you think you can kill this old master?!” The old man surnamed Wang roared angrily, his Saint Qi bursting out as a thick murderous intent condensed around him. Obviously, Wang Yu Han’s death had thoroughly enraged him.</p>
<p>As soon as he spoke these words, a yellow bell appeared in Manager Wang’s hand. This yellow bell was small enough to fit in one’s palm and looked quite unremarkable, but when Yang Kai saw it his eyes shrank, and he didn’t dare underestimate it.</p>
<p>The other party was a genuine First-Order Origin Realm master, but in order to deal with him, a Second-Order Saint King, he had actually summoned such a powerful artifact. Although part of the reason for Manager Wang doing this was rage, it was also clear that he realized he had to go all out.</p>
<p>Just as Yang Kai raised his guard against this strange yellow bell, Manager Wang flicked his wrist and the bell rang, its sound penetrating directly into Yang Kai’s ears. Yang Kai felt his heart beat violently and the speed of the blood flowing through his veins rapidly sped up.</p>
<p>“This old master has never used this Soul Burying Bell against a Saint King before, so you should feel honoured to die by it!” Manager Wang grit his teeth and shook his hand gently, continuing to ring the yellow bell.</p>
<p>Every time the bell’s sound rang in Yang Kai’s ear, his heartbeat accelerated. This ringing was quite strange and irregular, and after the second ring Yang Kai could already feel a sharp pain in his chest, as if his heart was about to burst.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s complexion changed as he immediately realized that no Origin Returning Realm master should be underestimated. This old man surnamed Wang was not young, and although age did not have much relation to cultivation, over a long life one would naturally gain more and better methods of killing their opponents.</p>
<p>Urging his Saint Qi, Yang Kai forcibly suppressed the pain in his heart while simultaneously summoning his Hundred Mountains Picture. In the next instant, sending a phantom peak smashing towards Manager Wang’s head.</p>
<p>A rumbling sound rang out, but the old man surnamed Wang completely disregarded this phantom peak, not even trying to dodge it as it approached. Opening his mouth, Manager Wang spat out a black flag that quickly flew up and expanded to over a dozen metres in length and formed a cover above his head. When the illusionary mountain smashed down, a multitude of eerie shadow-like figures rushed out of the black flag and intercepted it, preventing the mountain from reaching its target.</p>
<p>“Boy, use whatever means you have at your disposal! Today, this old master will let you die convinced!” The old man surnamed Wang clamoured wildly as he glared hatefully towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai sneered repeatedly, “Old dog, haven’t you made a mistake? It’s not just me fighting you!”</p>
<p>“You want to count on those two little girls...” Manager Wang glanced over at Qian Yue and Yang Yan disdainfully, but before he could finish speaking, his face changed dramatically as he saw Yang Yan actually take out an exquisite looking miniature pagoda and toss it up into the sky, allowing it to gently float mid-air.</p>
<p>This pagoda had seven levels to it and each one exuded a different colour. Each of the seven layers of the pagoda began rotating as it floated, each one revolving at a different speed, creating a strange resonant melody that resounded through the air.</p>
<p>This melody was extremely beautiful and sounded as if many different instruments were playing together, creating a harmonious ensemble. This mixed rhythm spread out a mysterious force that dispelled the pain in Yang Kai’s chest and even covered the dissonant sound of the Soul Burying Bell.</p>
<p>“A sound artifact!” Manager Wang stared at this scene in disbelief, his eyes twitching unconsciously.</p>
<p>His Shi had been broken by Yang Kai’s Golden Blood Thread, and the power of his Soul Burying Bell had been neutralized by this seven-layered pagoda, making Manager Wang suddenly feel as if his enemy had been specially put together to restrain him, causing his anger to erupt as well as a tinge of worry to sprout in his heart.</p>
<p>Yang Kai quickly charged, the Demonic Flame sword in his hands cleaving down as he laughed carefreely, “Old dog, just because Wang Yu Han thought of me as his love rival, you actually want to put me to death! Your care as an Elder is truly awe-inspiring! Since you have come to threaten me, don’t dream of leaving!”</p>
<p>“Too arrogant!” The old man surnamed Wang did not put this sword strike in his eyes at all, pushing his Saint Qi as he thrust his palm out to intercept it.</p>
<p>In the next moment though, Manager Wang suddenly felt a sharp pain in his Knowledge Sea, as if something was tearing at it, causing his face to pale and a sense of panic to spread through his heart.</p>
<p>But before he could investigate the situation inside his Knowledge Sea, another blade-like attack sliced towards his head, and he was forced to once again stretch out his palm to intercept it.</p>
<p>The accident in his Knowledge Sea drew so much of his attention that he did not bother investigating this incoming attack, but when Manager Wang’s hand contacted this black blade, he realized it was nothing like the previous sword wave.</p>
<p>Feeling a deep sense of crisis, the old man surnamed Wang tried to pull his hand back but was a moment too late. The black blade-like attack was like the sharpest of weapons and sliced through the palm of his hand as easily as a hot knife through butter, proceeding without any hindrance all the way to his shoulder.</p>
<p>Half of his arm vanished, as if it had been swallowed into the abdomen of some invisible beast, never to be seen again.</p>

<p>Chapter 1323, Completely Overwhelming</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>

<p>The loss of half his arm terrified Manager Wang and he hurriedly retreated several steps before turning to stare at Yang Kai with surprise and anger, clear shock apparent on his face. He was an Origin Returning Realm master, yet in a battle with a Second-Order Saint King, he had actually been seriously injured. If he told this story to anyone else, they would never have believed him.</p>
<p>Quickly condensing his Saint Qi at the severed section of his arm to prevent his blood from flowing out, the old man surnamed Wang took out a pill from his Space Ring and tossed it into his mouth all while keeping a watchful and somewhat fearful eye on Yang Kai. Since this boy could hurt him, he could also kill him!</p>
<p>Only now did Manager Wang have a moment to investigate the anomalies occurring inside his Knowledge Sea. If it wasn’t for the sharp pain in his Soul a moment ago, he would have been able to notice the strangeness of this boy’s last attack, so it was urgent to figure out what was happening to his Knowledge Sea.</p>
<p>After a brief investigation though, the old man surnamed Wang went pale and called out in shock, “Soul Devouring Insects? How is that possible?”</p>
<p>Under his investigation, he discovered that countless tiny insects had, at some point, infested his Knowledge Sea. These insects were so small they were invisible to the naked eye and at the moment they were actually lying dormant, seemingly waiting for orders before launching an attack.</p>
<p>The changes in his Knowledge Sea just now were obviously because these Soul Devouring Insects had begun consuming his Spiritual Energy!</p>
<p>Could the reason his Saint King Realm subordinates had been cut apart so easily by Yang Kai’s golden thread net have something to do with these Soul Devouring Insects as well? After understanding this point, Manager Wang felt cold sweat drip down his forehead. He had heard about Soul Devouring Insects before, but although they had quite an ominous reputation, ordinarily, he wouldn’t place them in his eyes, because with his Origin Realm strength, he should be fully capable of expelling them.</p>
<p>However, these Soul Devouring Insects were obviously different, some kind of mutated or evolved species. When Manager Wang tried to use his Divine Sense to drive them out, they remained completely unaffected, still burrowed deep into his Knowledge Sea, turning into a ticking time bomb that could explode at any moment. If he wanted to purge them completely, Manager Wang estimated it would take him at least two days of focused meditation!</p>
<p>Realizing this, the old man surnamed Wang suddenly began contemplating retreating.</p>
<p>His Shi and Soul Burying Bell were restrained and he had been seriously injured. On top of that, these Soul Devouring Insects had infested his Knowledge Sea and were just waiting for an opportunity to strike. If he didn’t withdraw now, he might never be able to, that black blade-like attack which cut through his arm frightened him terribly.</p>
<p>“Even able to recognize my Soul Devouring Insects, Old Dog, it seems your knowledge is quite broad! However, your luck has run out. Your Shi is useless against me, so this Young Master is truly your ultimate nemesis!” Yang Kai laughed sarcastically, waving his hand as he spoke, sending out a series of Space Blades that tore through space as they slashed forward. If someone were to probe these attacks with their Divine Sense, they would actually discover that they were composed of nothingness, as if they didn’t even really exist.</p>
<p>In an instant, more than a dozen pitch-black Space Blades silently shot towards the old man surnamed Wang.</p>
<p>Manager Wang’s eyes twitched and his complexion turned extremely ugly as he shouted, “Boy, don’t get too cocky!”</p>
<p>At the same time, he suddenly soared up into the sky and a mass of black mist burst from his body, covering a several dozen metre radius, this strange skill completely concealing his figure.</p>
<p>However, after the dozen or so Space Blades hacked through this black mist, leaving a series of wide, clear passages in their wake, The old man surnamed Wang’s voice cried out as he hurriedly tried to dodge.</p>
<p>“Old Dog, use whatever means you have at your disposal! Today, this Young Master will let you die convinced!” Yang Kai grinned mockingly as he began taunting his opponent, disrupting his concentration while unleashing a flurry of Space Blades towards him.</p>
<p>Manager Wang nearly coughed up blood when he heard Yang Kai’s words as they were exactly the ones he had spoken not long ago; however, the situation had completely reversed since then.</p>
<p>Feeling like he had slapped his own face, Manager Wang’s face turned a deep shade of crimson from both anger and embarrassment. At the same time, his expression filled with unwillingness, as he was forced to continue dodging Yang Kai’s Space Blades, unable to even argue back much less counterattack. When his arm had been severed by these black blade-like attacks, Manager Wang was unable to see the attribute of this attack, but now he had some speculations.</p>
<p>After all, the Space Force fluctuations emanating from the Space Blades was quite obvious. Manager Wang wasn’t a fool, so how could he not detect this?</p>
<p>The old man surnamed Wang was genuinely shocked! He never knew that on Shadowed Star someone had actually cultivated the Dao of Space to the point where they could condense a blade of Space Force and use it in combat with an enemy from a distance.</p>
<p>Even Elder Mo Xiao Sheng from Heaven Battling Union couldn’t do this! It was rumored that Elder Mo was proficient in the Dao of Space and many great forces would need to seek his assistance to repair their Space Arrays when they became damaged or malfunctioned, but even Elder Mo’s use of Space Force was not on the same level as that of this rampant young man.</p>
<p>The other party not only possessed Soul Devouring Insects capable of threatening him, he had also mastered this profound and mysterious skill! Manager Wang no longer dared underestimate Yang Kai and instead considered him an opponent of equal strength.</p>
<p>The stream of Space Blades seemed inexhaustible and each one fierce and unstoppable, cutting through and swallowing anything in their path as easily as crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood, making dodging the only action Manager Wang could take.</p>
<p>“Old Dog, do you only know how to flee?” Yang Kai snorted and after releasing a few more Space Blades, a lotus flower illusion suddenly appeared in his eyes as he shouted lowly, “Blossoming Lotus!”</p>
<p>While desperately dodging all of the Space Blades, Manager Wang’s figure suddenly came to an abrupt halt. Even if his gaze wasn’t meeting Yang Kai’s at this moment, a lotus bud still appeared in his vision and in an instant, the entire world seemed to disappear, leaving only the radiant seven coloured bud.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the old man surnamed Wang felt the Spiritual Energy in his Knowledge Sea madly draining towards the strange lotus bud, a phenomenon he was completely incapable of controlling.</p>
<p>As the Spiritual Energy of his Knowledge Sea was consumed, the lotus bud actually began to quickly blossom.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t understand what mysteries this blossoming lotus bud held, the old man surnamed Wang knew that he mustn’t allow it to fully bloom, otherwise the consequences would be dire.</p>
<p>With a great shout, Manager Wang bit his tongue and forcibly withdrew his attention from the blossoming lotus, causing his Knowledge Sea to tumble violently.</p>
<p><em>Hong...</em></p>
<p>A loud explosion resounded from the depths of Manager Wang’s Soul and his face instantly went pale white. Coughing up a mouthful of blood, his body staggered and he instantly felt several dozen years older.</p>
<p>Manager Wang had used some Secret Technique to burst the lotus bud, but doing so had clearly caused great damage to his own Soul.</p>
<p>Qian Yue was dumbstruck as she stood to the side and observed this battle, her eyes flashing brilliantly as her expression was filled with both joy and shock.</p>
<p>When she first noticed that they had fallen into an ambush, Qian Yue thought that all hope was lost, but how could she have imagined that the enemies she felt were impossible to defeat were actually easily routed and killed off by Yang Kai? Even Manager Wang wasn’t Yang Kai’s opponent.</p>
<p>If Qian Yue didn’t know Manager Wang, she might have thought that he was just another Saint King Realm cultivator, but she was well aware that he was a genuine Origin Returning Realm master. When she saw him, she was also trembling and talking carefully, but now, Manager Wang was panicking like a stray dog, no longer holding the swag of a former senior expert.</p>
<p>For a time, Qian Yue felt quite complex in her heart, staring at Yang Kai in something of a daze while thinking that Su Yan’s vision was really profound. When she had first met Yang Kai, she had looked down on and despised him greatly, but it seemed that Su Yan was the one who really stood high and saw far.</p>
<p>At this moment, she finally relaxed and took the opportunity to glance over at Yang Yan, but what she found was that the other party’s expression was completely indifferent, as if she hadn’t felt any tension at all. Qian Yue now realized that, from the start, Yang Yan had complete confidence in Yang Kai’s ability to win.</p>
<p>“Seems Origin Returning Realm masters really aren’t much!” Yang Kai sneered sarcastically, “In all honesty, I have no interest in Chen Shi Tao at all, nor did I have any intention to get in Wang Yu Han’s way, it was all your grand nephew’s petty insecurity that brought about his own destruction, even implicating his Elder in the process. If I were you, after acting so stupidly, I would get it over with and just kill myself. Why bother struggling to maintain your worthless existence?”</p>
<p>After listening to sarcastic ridicule, Manager Wang felt immense regret and annoyance. If what this boy said was really true, what was the point in coming here in the first place? To be humiliated and then die?</p>
<p>At this moment, Manager Wang wished he could drag Wang Yu Han back from hell so he could kill him a dozen times over. Although he continued wearing a fierce look on his face, in truth, he was already beginning to weaken.</p>
<p>He realized that even if he was in his peak state, he couldn’t defeat this strange boy. If he did not find an opportunity to escape soon, he might really never be able to leave here again.</p>
<p>A ruthless light flashed across Manager Wang’s eyes as he lifted his hand and pointed a hand sign towards the giant black flag he was using to resist the Hundred Mountains Picture, causing an unstable energy fluctuation to burst out from it. In the next instant, a loud explosion rang out as countless illusory phantoms flew out uncontrollably.</p>
<p>This artifact actually had the power to self destruct!</p>
<p>Yang Kai was shocked by this unexpected development and quickly withdrew the Hundred Mountains Picture before once again summoning his Purple Shield in front of Qian Yue and Yang Yan to protect them from the explosion fallout.</p>
<p>By the time Yang Kai finished this, he suddenly discovered that the old man surnamed Wang was already a thousand metres away.</p>
<p>[To think he is really trying to flee!]</p>
<p>Yang Kai coldly snorted as he unfurled his Wind and Thunder Wings, his figure flickering and disappearing in a storm of wind and thunder.</p>
<p>So far, he had not killed an Origin Returning Realm cultivator, so with such a rare opportunity in front of him, how could he possibly miss it? Moreover, after observing the various methods used by this old man surnamed Wang, it was obvious the other party’s understanding of Shi was quite deep. As long as Yang Kai could kill him and absorb his remnant Soul along with his understanding of the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao, it would be possible to begin comprehending Shi, preparing him for his eventual breakthrough to the Origin Returning Realm.</p>
<p>Although Manager Wang’s cultivation was higher than Yang Kai’s, he was still quite heavily injured, so with the assistance of his Wind and Thunder Wings, Yang Kai was able to move much faster.</p>

<p>Yang Kai was quickly closing the thousand-metre gap between himself and Manager Wang, but just as he was about to catch up, Yang Kai felt a shocking energy fluctuation rapidly approaching from behind. In the next instant, a stream of light shot past him and impacted the old man surnamed Wang’s back.</p>
<p>A pitiful scream rang out before Manager Wang fell to the ground, struggling for only a moment before lying still.</p>
<p>Yang Kai raised his brow as he looked back in surprise only to see Yang Yan in her black robe holding up a crossbow-like artifact.</p>
<p>Yang Kai recognized this artifact as one of the prizes he had looted in the Flowing Flame Sand Field.</p>
<p>He had obtained it from a cultivator from the Xie Family. The other party had used this artifact to sneak attack him but had ultimately failed to kill Yang Kai. In the end, Yang Kai had ended the Xie Family cultivator’s life. This artifact’s power was quite impressive, but the cost to use it was equally high, even requiring a blood sacrifice from its wielder, a truly evil artifact. As such, Yang Kai had not paid much attention to this crossbow after obtaining it and had simply tossed it into his Space Ring.</p>
<p>Now it seems that Yang Yan had improved and enhanced it, allowing her to use it against enemies in combat.</p>
<p>The old man surnamed Wang dying like this saved Yang Kai some trouble so he didn’t mind either way. Immediately walking over the body, Yang Kai urged the power of his Demon Eye of Annihilation and soon, Manager Wang’s Soul remnant was sucked into Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea and purified. Finished with this, Yang Kai removed Manager Wang’s Space Ring before turning around and returning to Yang Yan and Qian Yue.</p>
<p>Inside the abandoned hall, Qian Yue stared at Yang Kai, as if she was having trouble recognizing him.</p>
<p>After Yang Yan used the crossbow artifact, she had nearly collapsed, and her face had gone quite pale. It seemed even after her special refinement and improvement, the cost of using this artifact was still quite high.</p>
<p>“Let’s rest here for a while before setting out again, there should be no further ambushes,” Yang Kai said before handing Yang Yan a bottle of pills then walking over to the Space Array.</p>
<p>He wanted to completely destroy this Space Array to ensure that any further arrangements his opponents might have made couldn’t be implemented, and to ensure that no clues about what happened here were left behind.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this time, Yang Yan quickly adjusted her breathing while Qian Yue went to clean up the remains of the other fallen Saint King Realm cultivators.</p>
<p>While Yang Yan sat in meditation, both Yang Kai and Qian Yue finished their respective work and Qian Yue handed over the Space Rings she had collected to Yang Kai, the look of shock still lingering on her face, as if she was unable to believe the scene she had just witnessed, even now.</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced at her and naturally understood what she was thinking. Waving his hand lightly, he said, “Keep those Space Rings for yourself, there’s probably nothing good inside them, but there are probably some resources which will be suitable for you to use. Don’t reject, when you reach Dragon Cave Mountain, you’ll understand what true riches look like and how worthless these things are.”</p>
<p>Qian Yue froze for a moment, but eventually did not object, simply happily replying, “Then I’ll look forward to it.”</p>
<p>She really could not help anticipating arriving at Dragon Cave Mountain now. Since wandering about destitute through the Star Field and arriving at Joyous Union Pavilion, Qian Yue had never met anyone she knew or found a place to rely on. She felt like a rootless tree, a river without a source, suffering through each day.</p>
<p>But now, Yang Kai had appeared in front of her, allowing her to find a pillar of support for her weary heart and giving her hope for the future. Although Yang Kai was her Junior, this Junior had now exceeded her cultivation, so depending on him a little was not something to feel embarrassed about.</p>
<p>While waiting for Yang Yan to restore herself, Yang Kai sat down and began reviewing his gains and losses from this battle.</p>
<p>This was not the first time Yang Kai had battled an Origin Returning Realm master, but it was his first time killing such a cultivator. If not for the interference from his Soul Devouring Insects and his mastery of the Dao of Space, however, Yang Kai estimated he would not have been Manager Wang’s opponent.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this battle allowed him to understand that his Golden Blood Thread could cut apart Shi, a pleasant surprise. When Deng Ning of Demon Blood Temple handed him the Demon Blood Thread Secret Technique, he had not mentioned anything about this particular ability.</p>
<p>Facing this old man surnamed Wang, a First-Order Origin Returning Realm master, Yang Kai had to go all out, so what about a master at the Second-Order or Third-Order?</p>
<p>Yang Kai suddenly realized that his cultivation realm was still too low. After returning to Dragon Cave Mountain, he decided to enter retreat to break through to the next realm. Only when his cultivation reached the Origin Returning Realm would he not have to fear anyone on Shadowed Star.</p>
<p>Half a day later, Yang Yan had restored herself sufficiently, so Yang Kai summoned his Star Shuttle and left this deserted city with the two women.</p>
<p>After flying for two days, the trio arrived at a small town and Yang Kai flew down to ask for directions. After learning that this place was only half a month away from Heavenly Fate City, he finally relaxed.</p>
<p>He was really afraid that the deserted city was actually farther away from Heavenly Fate City than Black Crow City, but it seemed his luck was good and Wang Yu Han had chosen to set up this ambush in the same direction as Heavenly Fate City.</p>
<p>On top of that, they had arrived inside Shadow Moon Hall’s territory, so with his friendship with Qian Tong, Wei Gu Chang, and Dong Xuan’er, they were basically safe.</p>
<p>Along the way, Yang Kai remained silent as he was immersed in planning what to do in the future, while Yang Yan and Qian Yue chatted a bit from time to time. Like this, half a month passed by and the group of three arrived at Dragon Cave Mountain. As soon as she saw this place, Qian Yue fell in love with it.</p>
<p>Although Dragon Cave Mountain was not as grand and imposing as the foundations of a great Sect, it had its own unique style. The mountains and rivers here were all incredibly beautiful, making it seem like an untouched paradise.</p>
<p>After letting Yang Yan help Qian Yue settle in, Yang Kai went to see the Divine Tree and learned that it was currently in good spirits. On top of that, the Golden Sun Fruit Tree Yang Kai had transplanted was now doing well, its vitality slowly growing stronger with no possibility of it perishing anymore.</p>
<p>After giving the Divine Tree a drop of Golden Blood, Yang Kai immediately announced he was entering retreat.</p>
<p>Inside his cave mansion, Yang Kai played with a small, crystal-clear bead in his hand as tenderness filled his eyes.</p>
<p>This bead was Su Yan’s Ice Soul Bead. As long as this bead remained intact, the person who condensed it was certainly still alive. Although he did not know where Su Yan was right now, as long as this Ice Soul Bead remained, it meant she was still fine.</p>
<p>Feeling Su Yan’s aura gently wafting from this bead made Yang Kai feel nostalgic.</p>
<p>After watching it for a long time, Yang Kai smiled warmly, held it tightly, closed his eyes, and silently cultivated, attempting to break through.</p>
<p>Back in Joyous Union Pavilion, Yang Kai had touched the threshold of the Third-Order Saint King Realm, but at that time, he was too anxious to hear news about Su Yan, so he had firmly suppressed his breakthrough. Now that he had returned to Dragon Cave Mountain, his first order of business was to attempt a breakthrough again.</p>
<p>The Ten Thousand Year Incense burned in the background, its mellow and calming fragrance filling the air. The place where Yang Kai chose to meditate was also right beside the Nine Branch Jade Crystal Tree, and with his thorough comprehension of the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao, this breakthrough posed no problem to him.</p>
<p>With just a trivial ten days worth of effort, and without the assistance of any pills or Saint Crystals, Yang Kai successfully broke through to the Third-Order Saint King Realm.</p>
<p>His breakthrough did not cause any spectacular scene as the cave mansion was completely isolated by powerful Spirit Arrays, so not even the other residents of Dragon Cave Mountain knew Yang Kai had made a breakthrough.</p>
<p>After taking another month or so to consolidate his cultivation, Yang Kai began taking inventory of his harvest from his latest trip.</p>
<p>With a thought, Yang Kai summoned another bead into the palm of his hand. This bead was different from Su Yan’s Ice Soul Bead, it had an inconspicuous grey appearance. It was the Coloured Glass Bead Dai Yuan had given him.</p>
<p>As Dai Yuan cultivated her Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Art, taking a small amount of Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass into her body, she was able to condense this bead which was equivalent to the Monster Core of a Monster Beast. It was extremely valuable.</p>
<p>Dai Yuan had said that if he could refine this Coloured Glass Bead, he might be able to comprehend the mysteries of Coloured Glass Divine Light!</p>
<p>Coloured Glass Divine Light had the incredible ability to suppress others’ Souls and it was very difficult to guard against. Yang Kai had even suffered a small loss to this Coloured Glass Divine Light, so he had a deep interest in it. If he could really achieve what Dai Yuan said, it would give him another powerful card to use in battle.</p>
<p>Moreover, Coloured Glass Divine Light shared some similarities with his Demon Eye of Annihilation; both had the function of suppressing other’s Souls, so if he was able to combine the two of them, Yang Kai couldn’t say what kind of mutation would happen.</p>
<p>After quietly contemplating for a while, Yang Kai decided to put aside this Coloured Glass Bead for now and instead take out his Origin King Grade Artifact Refining Furnace.</p>
<p>Inside the Corpse Cave, in order to collect the Sun’s True Essence, the Firebird Artifact Spirit had suffered some injuries, but Yang Kai had learned afterwards that this had actually been a blessing in disguise because the Artifact Spirit had ingested a wisp of Sun’s True Fire and was assimilating it inside the Artifact Refining Furnace.</p>
<p>Now, more than a month had passed, yet the Firebird showed no signs of awakening as it was still refining that wisp of Sun’s True Fire. However, when he observed it, Yang Kai discovered that the wisp of Sun’s True Fire had diminished greatly while the Artifact Spirit’s aura had become significantly more powerful.</p>
<p>Yang Kai immediately understood that the Artifact Spirit had truly obtained huge benefits from that incident.</p>
<p>Leaving it alone, Yang Kai put away the Artifact Refining Furnace.</p>
<p>Next, Yang Kai checked on the Stone Puppet. The Stone Puppet was the same as the Artifact Spirit. Some time ago, when the Stone Puppet spat out the Sun’s True Essence, Yang Kai had told it to absorb as much mineral essence as it needed to repair itself, but upon seeing it now, Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling a bit surprised.</p>
<p>The Stone Puppet’s injuries were now completely healed, and after being released by Yang Kai, its pair of eyes sparkled somewhat, its spirituality having obviously increased greatly.</p>
<p>However, what shocked Yang Kai the most was that the Stone Puppet’s body now seemed to contain an extremely intense Fire Attribute Energy. Even with his powerful Divine Sense, Yang Kai was unable to probe this Fire Attribute Energy as it was burnt the moment it tried to make contact with it.</p>
<p>Sun’s True Fire!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the Stone Puppet had absorbed some Sun’s True Fire! And it had finished refining this Sun’s True Fire even before the Fire Attribute Artifact Spirit. This was a bit of a pleasant surprise and made Yang Kai realize just how powerful the Stone Puppet’s innate talent was. Even the Artifact Spirit born from pure Fire Attribute Energy could not compare to it.</p>
<p>The Stone Puppet had an innate ability to quench and refine minerals, and now it seemed that the Sun’s True Fire was no exception, in the future this pure Fire Attribute Energy would only become purer and more potent.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Yang Kai had yet to find another Blood Essence Stone; after all, there was another Stone Puppet in his Black Book Space, but without a Blood Essence Stone, that Stone Puppet couldn’t be hatched from its black shell.</p>
<p>After confirming that the Stone Puppet was alright, and even gained some unexpected advantages, Yang Kai sent it a Divine Sense command.</p>
<p>The Stone Puppet opened its mouth a moment later and began spitting out a massive amount of refined ores, soon creating a massive hill in front of Yang Kai.</p>

<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain &amp; Dhael Ligerkeys</p>
<p>These items were all from the Corpse Cave and had been swallowed by the Stone Puppet. At that time, Yang Kai and Yang Yan had been busy trying to collect the Sun’s True Essence, so they hadn’t had any time to deal with the mountains of materials and Saint Crystals lying around. Therefore, they had let the Stone Puppet handle this matter.</p>
<p>There had been seven or eight hills of various ores and a few more of pure Saint Crystals, so although the Stone Puppet only had time to swallow about half of them, they still added up to an amazing amount.</p>
<p>Some of the ores had their essence absorbed by the Stone Puppet to strengthen it and make up for the damage caused by the Sun’s True Fire, but the vast majority was now piled up in front of Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Up until now, Yang Kai had too many things on his mind, so he wasn’t able to take inventory of this harvest, but since they had been piled up out in the open, Yang Kai figured these materials weren’t as high in quality or rarity as the ores he had found in the four Space Rings atop the Ice Jade Pedestal. Sweeping them with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai confirmed his speculations.</p>
<p>However, he did not need to worry about such things as all these minerals would be handed over to Yang Yan to process.</p>
<p>While preparing to stuff these ores into Space Rings, Yang Kai’s eyes suddenly landed on one of the hills of materials. He reached out, and picked up a fist-sized, perfectly round, flawless and pure white object.</p>
<p>Staring at this sphere in amazement, Yang Kai soon had a thought and a look of surprise filled his eyes. Circulating his Secret Art, he noticed the huge amount of pure energy flowing from the sphere in his hand into his body and his expression turned strange, glancing over at the Stone Puppet in amazement and asking, “You can even purify this kind of thing?”</p>
<p>The Stone Puppet looked at him with a tilted head and did not say a word.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled slightly, knowing that it might not be able to express its thoughts; after all, the Stone Puppet’s sapience was limited.</p>
<p>Taking out the token Yang Yan gave him to control the cave mansion’s arrays, Yang Kai poured his Divine Sense into it and sent out a message.</p>
<p>A moment later, the barrier around the cave mansion was opened from the outside and Yang Yan walked in quickly, asking curiously, “Didn’t you say you were going to enter retreat? Why suddenly call me over?”</p>
<p>“Look at this!” Yang Kai said as he tossed the white sphere in his hand over to her. Catching it, Yang Yan looked at him suspiciously for a moment before taking a closer look at the sphere.</p>
<p>Soon after, Yang Yan’s beautiful eyes widened as a look of pleasant surprise filled her face, as if she had just discovered something incredible. Quickly turning to Yang Kai, she eagerly asked, “Where did you get this thing? Are there any more?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai simply pointed his finger to a hill in front of him.</p>
<p>Yang Yan turned her head in the direction he pointed and was immediately dumbstruck as she saw many similar spheres lying in that hill.</p>
<p>After a few breaths, Yang Yan let out a cry of joy as she rushed over to the hill and began stuffing everything into her own Space Ring.</p>
<p>“Leave me a few,” Yang Kai stared at her with a depressed expression.</p>
<p>“What do you want them for?” Yang Yan snorted as her small hand covered her Space Ring, hiding it from view.</p>
<p>“Cultivation. You can see what these things are formed from, right? I just finished breaking through so using these things will help better consolidate my realm,” Yang Kai said while his face twitched slightly.</p>
<p>“Of course I can see what this is! These things should have been condensed by Xiao Xiao, right?” Yang Yan picked up the Stone Puppet and kissed it repeatedly, causing Yang Kai to wear a dumbfounded look while the Stone Puppet wore a helpless one.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect that Xiao Xiao could even purify and compress Saint Crystals. This is perfect! One of the worries I had has been solved, hehe!” Yang Yan stared at the Stone Puppet with her beautiful eyes, seemingly wishing she could kiss it a few more times.</p>
<p>“Can Stone Puppets even purify and compress Saint Crystals? Did you know about this before?” Yang Kai asked curiously.</p>
<p>Yang Yan shook her head, “I tried before, but Xiao Xiao didn’t have this ability then. Stone Puppets have an innate ability to absorb and temper various ores and mineral essences, refining them into their bodies to strengthen themselves. Xiao Xiao being able to do this now might have something to do with it absorbing some of the Sun’s True Essence, although I’m not completely sure.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yang Kai gently nodded, the Sun’s True Essence was said to be the source essence extracted from a Sun Star. The Stone Puppet had refined a little Sun’s True Fire, so it wasn’t surprising that its abilities had undergone some changes.</p>
<p>However, being able to purify and compress Saint Crystals, transforming their essence into the shape of a ball was quite a sensational development.</p>
<p>Throughout the Star Field, the highest quality Saint Crystal known so far was High-Rank Saint Crystal, but the existence of this sphere completely went against that norm, creating a brand-new precedent.</p>
<p>The energy contained in this sphere was both denser and purer than an equivalent-sized piece of High-Rank Saint Crystal. Yang Kai had only absorbed a small part of it, but he estimated that the energy contained inside this sphere was five to six times greater than High-Rank Saint Crystal.</p>
<p>That was not to say that the value of this sphere was only that of five or six High-Rank Saint Crystals of equivalent size; in fact, its value was far greater than this.</p>
<p>In theory, the exchange ratio between High-Rank Saint Crystal, Mid-Rank Saint Crystal, and Low-Rank Saint Crystal was one to ten, but every cultivator knew that in truth, the higher the rank of Saint Crystal, the greater its value was.</p>
<p>With higher quality Saint Crystals, a cultivator would be better able to impact their bottlenecks, restore their Saint Qi, or restore themselves while meditating. At a critical moment, such an advantage may even mean the difference between life and death.</p>
<p>Although the energy contained in this sphere was only equivalent to the sum of five or six High-Rank Saint Crystals of equal size, if it were to be circulated in large quantities, it would likely be valued at ten or even twenty High-Rank Saint Crystals.</p>
<p>Of course, that was only assuming a massive amount of them entered the market. If this sphere were to be auctioned off as a single treasure, it could likely sell for 100,000 High-Rank Saint Crystals or more.</p>
<p>After all, rare things were always more expensive.</p>
<p>Of course, Yang Kai didn’t have any intention of releasing these things into the market. From Yang Yan’s reaction just now, this Saint Crystal sphere which had unintentionally been compressed by the Stone Puppet was of great use to her.</p>
<p>Most likely, this was related to whatever secret project she had been working on. Yang Kai did not ask any questions though. Since Yang Yan had said she wanted to give him a surprise, he decided to patiently wait until she was ready to reveal it to him.</p>
<p>After confirming that these spheres were something the Stone Puppet had created after refining the Sun’s True Fire, Yang Kai set the matter aside and asked Yang Yan about Qian Yue. Apparently, since coming here, Qian Yue had quickly gotten close to the other residents and Wu Yi had provided her with a lot of cultivation resources and a good cultivation environment. Right now, she was also in secluded retreat.</p>
<p>After about the time it would take to boil a cup of tea, Yang Yan happily walked out of Yang Kai’s cave mansion, taking with her not only the strange Saint Crystal spheres and all of the various ores, but even the Stone Puppet as well.</p>
<p>According to her, even if Yang Kai had not called her over, she would have come looking for him to ask for the Stone Puppet’s help. With the Stone Puppet beside her, the efficiency of her Artifact Refining would greatly increase, which was essential to bringing her grand plan to fruition.</p>
<p>After Yang Yan left, Yang Kai opened the cave mansion barrier again while touching the special Space Ring Yang Yan had refined for him with a smile on his face. There were only two things inside this ring, the Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade Pedestal and the Sun’s True Essence; however, these two things were without a doubt the most valuable and precious treasures he had obtained on this trip. If any news were to leak of their existence, it would create a stir across all of Shadowed Star.</p>
<p>Pondering for a while, Yang Kai’s expression became dignified as he took out a certain ancient book.</p>
<p>This ancient book had also been obtained from the Corpse Cave and had once belonged to the Ancient Yang Sect. At first, there were too many of these ancient books and Yang Kai did not have time to investigate them carefully. Later, while Yang Yan was refining the special Space Ring to store the Sun’s True Essence, Yang Kai casually browsed through these ancient books and this one in particular had caught his attention.</p>
<p>Because this ancient book was not some ordinary Secret Art, but rather one that was specifically for Body Tempering.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s physical body was already much stronger than average cultivators in the same realm, but this was a result of various opportunities he had come across over the years rather than intentional cultivation. Secret Arts specifically for Body Tempering and Soul Cultivation were extremely rare, and even if some were occasionally widely circulated outside, they were generally trash that couldn’t enter the eyes of truly powerful masters. Yang Kai naturally looked down on these generic methods as well.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had never expected that in the underground Corpse Cave of the Ancient Yang Sect he would obtain this Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art.</p>
<p>When Yang Kai first saw it, he thought that this Secret Book was an art related to swordsmanship, but after careful investigation, he learned it was actually a Body Tempering Secret Art.</p>
<p>Yang Kai had a rough understanding of this Secret Art from the last time he browsed through and knew it was extremely profound and mysterious. If this Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art worked as described, once someone cultivated it to the extreme, they would be able to obtain a near immortal and indestructible physique; moreover, even at the minor accomplishment stage, one would be able to use their vitality and Blood Qi to condense Five Elements Profound Heavenly Sword Qi, which had incredible offensive and defensive power.</p>
<p>Reading about this Secret Art’s possibilities made Yang Kai excited, but the requirements to cultivate it were also extremely high.</p>
<p>The physical strength of anyone who wished to cultivate this Secret Art had to already be at least twice as high as an average cultivator in the same realm just to withstand the pain involved in the tempering process. This condition was no problem for Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Secondly, one needed to possess extremely strong vitality because cultivating this Secret Art would cause a great deal of harm to oneself. If one did not possess tenacious vitality, not only would they fail to cultivate this Secret Art, they may end up losing their life in the process. Yang Kai felt that this requirement would also not be an issue for him. Although he did not dare claim he had the strongest vitality of any cultivator in the Star Field, with the astonishing restorative power of his Golden Blood, he was confident that only a few people could surpass him in this aspect.</p>
<p>Thirdly, to cultivate the Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art, one needed to obtain extremely high-rank precious treasures from the five basic elements. By absorbing and refining the energy contained in these precious treasures, they would continuously temper their flesh and wash their marrow. After many years of repeated accumulation, one would eventually reach the pinnacle of the Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art.</p>
<p>What kind of precious treasures were required was only vaguely described in the Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art’s ancient book, but essentially, the minimum requirement would be something equivalent to a Tenth-Order Monster Beast’s Monster Core.</p>
<p>This requirement alone basically made it impossible for anyone on Shadowed Star to cultivate this Secret Art; after all, Tenth-Order Monster Beasts were equivalent to Origin King Realm masters, and there were no such things on Shadowed Star.</p>
<p>Yang Kai currently had two treasures he was certain met these criteria: The Sun’s True Essence and the Profound Yin Sunflower Water. The Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade Pedestal also met the appropriate conditions, but if he were to really begin cultivating this Secret Art, Yang Kai wasn’t prepared to use the Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade Pedestal as he had other important uses for it.</p>
<h2>1326</h2>
<p>Chapter 1326, Accident</p>
<p>In addition to the Fire and Water Attribute treasures, Yang Kai also had the Bird Wood, which might satisfy the Wood Attribute treasure.</p>
<p>This Bird Wood was something Yang Kai obtained before arriving on Shadowed Star and was formed from the corpse of a Tenth-Order Thunder Luan Monster Beast. It should be no worse than the Monster Core of a Tenth-Order Monster Beast in value.</p>
<p>As for where he could find appropriate Earth and Metal Attribute treasures, Yang Kai temporarily had no ideas.</p>
<p>However, he wasn’t in a hurry; after all, even if he did manage to gather treasures from all five elements, he didn’t have time to dedicate to cultivating this Body Tempering Secret Art. Right now, Yang Kai had to cultivate his Space Blade and Golden Blood Thread Secret Technique, refine the Dragon Bone and Dragon Bead, and find a way to refine the Coloured Glass Bead.</p>
<p>The Golden Blood Thread was of particular importance to Yang Kai after he learned that it was capable of cutting through Shi. Yang Kai’s evaluation of this Demon Blood Temple Secret Technique had risen dramatically after he discovered this and he couldn’t help praising its creator for their ingenuity once more.</p>
<p>Currently, he had only cultivated a single Golden Blood Thread, and even that had yet to reach the grand accomplishment stage. Yang Kai wanted to cultivate more Golden Blood Threads, but he had no idea how much time that would take. For these reasons, even though Yang Kai was extremely interested in this Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art, he didn’t immediately begin cultivating it, planning to wait until he collected all the required treasures first.</p>
<p>Of course, studying and comprehending this Secret Art wasn’t an issue as doing so would allow him to gain twice the result with half the effort once he did begin cultivating it.</p>
<p>After silently making up his mind, Yang Kai temporarily stored the Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art back into his Space Ring before clearing his head of distractions and beginning to absorb the Soul remnant left behind by Manager Wang.</p>
<p>This was the first Origin Returning Realm Soul remnant that Yang Kai had absorbed, so naturally, he was quite prudent and careful with it, refining it slowly to ensure he didn’t miss anything.</p>
<p>After three days, the Soul remnant of the old man surnamed Wang was completely refined and Yang Kai opened his eyes to reveal a thoughtful look.</p>
<p>Although Manager Wang’s cultivation wasn’t very high, he had spent many years in the First-Order Origin Returning Realm and had his own unique insights into Shi. Now, these insights had become Yang Kai’s and through this refinement, he had gained a small understanding of Shi.</p>
<p>An understanding was one thing, but Yang Kai realized even more now that if he wanted to try to cultivate Shi, it would be almost impossible unless he broke through to the Origin Returning Realm. However, if he were to face an Origin Returning Realm master again, Yang Kai would now be able to use his understanding of Shi to bolster his resistance to it, so it wasn’t like he hadn’t obtained any immediate benefits at all.</p>
<p>Yang Kai believed that as long as he killed more Origin Returning Realm masters in the future, his comprehension of Shi would continue to increase, allowing many grains of sand to become a tall tower and ultimately reach a height greater than anyone else.</p>
<p>Regarding the process of breaking through, only when an Origin Returning Realm master cultivated their Shi to the grand accomplishment stage would they have a chance to break through to the Origin King Realm, but on Shadowed Star, no person was able to achieve this, so no Origin King Realm masters currently existed here.</p>
<p>The World Principles of Shadowed Star suppressed all the Origin Realm masters’ understanding of Shi. Yang Kai had yet to reach this level but even so, it was impossible for him to remain trapped on Shadowed Star forever. If he really reached the peak of the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, Yang Kai would find a way to leave Shadowed Star, escape the suppression of its World Principles, and break through to the Origin King Realm in the outside world.</p>
<p>It was too early to be worried about such things, however, so Yang Kai quickly focused his mind and took out the Coloured Glass Bead Dai Yuan had given him, holding it in his palm before silently pouring his Saint Qi into it, attempting to refine it.</p>
<p>After maintaining this process for some time, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed as a look of pleasant surprise appeared on his face. Immediately increasing the output of his Saint Qi, a faint multi-coloured light began leaking from the Coloured Glass Bead into Yang Kai’s body, and under his guidance, it began gathering in his left eye.</p>
<p>This Coloured Glass Bead was equivalent to a Monster Beast’s Monster Core, so Yang Kai had thought that refining it and absorbing the energy from a Monster Beast’s Monster Core would be the same. Therefore, he had tried to use this kind of direct method and, to his surprise, it seemed this method was not only effective, but also quite easy to implement.</p>
<p>This made him overjoyed.</p>
<p>No longer holding back, Yang Kai slowly began to refine this Coloured Glass Bead while continuing to cultivate the Golden Blood Threads inside his body at the same time.</p>
<p>Time flew by and soon it had been two months.</p>
<p>This day, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes and glanced down at his empty palm, furrowing his brow.</p>
<p>After two months of absorption, the Coloured Glass Bead Dai Yuan had given him was finally consumed clean and no longer existed. However, although this Coloured Glass Bead’s essence had been absorbed into his body, it would still take some time for Yang Kai to completely refine it. Now, in his Knowledge Sea, the gorgeous glowing light comprised of the Coloured Glass Divine Light contained inside the Coloured Glass Bead was suspended close to the Demon Eye of Annihilation.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai felt that it was going to take quite some time to fuse this Coloured Glass Divine Light with his Demon Eye of Annihilation, something that slightly differed from his expectations, causing him to feel a bit unhappy.</p>
<p>After all, according to his previous predictions, the Demon Eye of Annihilation and the Coloured Glass Divine Light shared many similarities. So, in theory, they should have easily integrated, but now it appeared that his thinking had been too naive.</p>
<p>But such a possibility wasn’t beyond Yang Kai’s expectations, and as long as there was enough time, the Coloured Glass Divine Light and his Demon Eye of Annihilation could be successfully combined, the only difference now was how long it would take.</p>
<p>Putting this matter aside temporarily, Yang Kai waved his hand casually and two Golden Threads appeared from it.</p>
<p>One of these Golden Threads radiated a brilliant golden light and seemed capable of cutting space itself with unstoppable might. The other Golden Thread was obviously inferior to the first, with not only its coloured being dimmer but the power contained within it also being weaker.</p>
<p>This Golden Thread was the second one Yang Kai had condensed.</p>
<p>When a Demon Blood Temple cultivator cultivated this Secret Technique, even if they spent their entire life they may not have been able to create two Demon Blood Threads because the foundation of this technique was their own vitality. Everyone had a limited amount of vitality and using it excessively endangered their life. In Demon Blood Temple, only Elder-level characters whose strength had reached the Second or Third-Order Origin Returning Realm were capable of cultivating two or three Demon Blood Threads, while those below the Origin Realm would never have more than one.</p>
<p>Even so, these Elders were only able to cultivate multiple Demon Blood Threads after consuming numerous elixirs to nourish their vitality, otherwise, once they used too much of their vital energy they would die.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai was different as there were several dozen drops of Golden Blood in his body. One drop of Golden Blood could be converted into a Golden Blood Thread, and he could increase the amount of Golden Blood in his veins infinitely. In theory, Yang Kai could condense countless Golden Blood Threads, which was also why he dedicated so much time and effort to this Secret Technique. It was simply tailor-made for him.</p>
<p>More than a month ago, he felt that his first Golden Thread had been cultivated as far as it could be.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that this Golden Thread was refined to its peak though. Because he had only obtained the first half of the Demon Blood Thread Secret Technique, Yang Kai simply didn’t know how to continue enhancing this Golden Thread.</p>
<p>With no other choice, Yang Kai began to cultivate this second thread.</p>
<p>With his previous experience, this second Golden Thread took shape much faster than the first and Yang Kai was certain he could bring it to its limit much faster as well.</p>
<p>Also, while cultivating the second Golden Thread, Yang Kai faintly realized something.</p>
<p>He felt that this Secret Technique wasn’t as simple as he first thought. If he had enough Golden Threads, he may be able to combine them to take on new forms and functions, but none of these were introduced in the first half of the Demon Blood Thread Secret Technique, so Yang Kai could only speculate that they were hidden in the second half!</p>
<p>After cultivating his Golden Threads to their limit, Yang Kai had no idea how to continue enhancing them or how to combine or manipulate them, so everything right now was only his own speculation. It seemed that if there was a chance in the future, he would have to pay Demon Blood Temple a visit. Only by obtaining the second half of the Demon Blood Thread Secret Technique could he continue enhancing his Golden Blood Threads.</p>
<p>During this retreat Yang Kai had gained a lot and, after calculating how much time he had been in seclusion, he decided it was time to go out.</p>
<p>He remembered Yang Yan saying that she would require his power to complete whatever project she was working on last time, but he couldn’t tell if that time had come yet. Since he had been in retreat all this time, Yang Yan had definitely not considered disturbing him.</p>
<p>Having made up his mind, Yang Kai took another look at the Red Candle Fruit piece to make sure it showed no signs of withering under the nourishing of the Red Candle Stalk before opening the cave mansion’s barrier and leaving.</p>
<p>The World Energy aura on Dragon Cave Mountain seemed to have become a bit richer than before, but this was only to be expected as there weren’t very many cultivators living here and their respective cultivations weren’t high. Because of this, the World Energy which was drawn to Dragon Cave Mountain by the Aura Gathering Array would only grow in richness, unlike in big Sects where thousands of disciples would continuously consume it. In such Sects, even if they had high-quality Earth Veins providing a constant stream of World Energy, maintaining a balance was the best they could do.</p>
<p>Dragon Cave Mountain was peaceful and quiet, and as Yang Kai swept his eyes around, he was unable to see anyone at all. This wasn’t a surprise though. Releasing his Divine Sense, Yang Kai quickly found where Yang Yan and the others were.</p>
<p>But what puzzled Yang Kai was that all those who had any authority on Dragon Cave Mountain were gathered together, as if they were discussing something important.</p>
<p>With a slight smile, Yang Kai wandered over to a bamboo tower where these few people were gathered, but before he arrived he heard Hao An’s voice call out, “They’re going too far! They were the ones who set the price in the first place, so why is this happening now?”</p>
<p>Immediately, Chang Qi responded in a calming tone, “Okay, okay! Old Hao, sit down first. The young ones are all sitting calmly, so why are you getting all excited for?”</p>
<p>“Foreign Elder Chang, what do you think of this?” Wu Yi asked.</p>
<p>“Hmph, this situation is clearly a little strange!” Chang Qi replied with a sneer, “Our cooperation with Shadow Moon Hall isn’t something recent. Over the past two years, the number of materials we have purchased from them can be considered to be astonishing, worth in excess of two hundred million Saint Crystals. We’ve always negotiated in good faith and paid in full, but now they are suddenly saying the cost of materials has increased! There’s definitely something more to this than meets the eye.”</p>
<p>“Exactly! Not only that, they even detained Yu Feng, which is also truly unusual,” Hao An seemed to have calmed down and agreed with him.</p>
<p>“On top of that, I noticed another strange matter,” Wu Yi said pensively deeply.</p>
<p>“Oh, what?”</p>
<p>“For the past three months, many of the shopkeepers and shop hands belonging to Shadow Moon Hall in Heavenly Fate City have been replaced and the people we’re all familiar with have completely disappeared. I cannot even find Luo Qing anymore.”</p>
<p>Inside the bamboo tower, the group of people looked around at each other as they suddenly realized that something big must have changed inside Shadow Moon Hall.</p>
<h2>1327</h2>
<p>Chapter 1327, Yu Feng Detained</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; Green Fish</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain &amp; Dhael Ligerkeys</p>
<p>Amidst the crowd’s rising suspicions, the main door of the bamboo tower opened, and a single person stepped in.</p>
<p>After an initial period of shock, everyone stood up, having recognized the person who entered. Wu Yi said in joy, “Yang Kai, you came out of seclusion?”</p>
<p>“Mhm,” Yang Kai nodded. Looking around the crowd, his gaze finally settled onto Qian Yue. She was looking much better than when Yang Kai saw her at the Joyous Union Pavillion, a reassuring sign that she was rather happy with her life here.</p>
<p>Off to the side, Chang Qi and Hao An exchanged a glance, a look of awe flashing across their eyes. Both of them made a fist palm salute at the same time. “Congratulations, Nephew Yang, for reaching Third-Order Saint King. Your rate of cultivation is unmatched within the entire Shadowed Star.”</p>
<p>When they went to the Flowing Flame Sand Field, Yang Kai was a mere First-Order Saint King. By the time they made it out of there, he had reached the Second-Order, and now he was already a Third-Order, all within a period of two to three years. This left the duo with not just a sense of awe, but also a slight feeling of inferiority. Compared to Yang Kai’s cultivation speed, they were mediocre at best.</p>
<p>“You flatter me, Foreign Elders. Luck played no small role in getting me to where I am today. Compared to the true geniuses, this is nothing.” Yang Kai smiled humbly before changing the topic, “That aside, I heard you discussing Shadow Moon Hall and mentioning something about Yu Feng being detained? I want to hear more about this.”</p>
<p>Hearing Yang Kai’s questions, everyone exchanged glances, allowing Wu Yi to take up the role of explaining the situation to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Listening to her explanations, Yang Kai finally found out about the unfavourable occurrences which had taken place in Heavenly Fate City regarding the order of goods Dragon Cave Mountain had made from the Shadow Moon Hall a month ago.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Yu Feng led cultivators from the Hai Ke Family to Heavenly Fate City to pick up the goods, only to find that they refused to honour the previous terms of exchange, instead raising the price of the goods by more than a good thirty percent.</p>
<p>Such a price was obviously unacceptable, and Yu Feng immediately went to reason with Shadow Moon Hall’s person-in-charge stationed there. However, they refused to back down a single inch. Exasperated, Yu Feng then requested them to return the initial deposit. After all, they were the ones who went back on the contract, and Yu Feng thought that they should at least get the deposit back even if they were not going to purchase the goods.</p>
<p>Nobody expected even that request to be refused. Not only that, they decided to resort to force to settle the conflict, resulting in Yu Feng and the other four disciples being injured.</p>
<p>Obviously, Yu Feng’s group wouldn’t simply sit there and allow themselves to be beaten up, so they returned a few blows, damaging some of the shelves within the shop. They were immediately captured by an Origin Returning Realm master, detained, and stripped of all of the Saint Crystals which they were preparing to use for the exchange.</p>
<p>Only a single disciple was allowed to return to let Dragon Cave Mountain know that they had to prepare a large amount of Saint Crystals as ransom.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Wu Yi and the rest wouldn’t have known about the details either.</p>
<p>Having listened to the explanation, Yang Kai remained calm and expressionless, speaking only after a moment of thought, “Their lives are not in danger, right?”</p>
<p>“According to the disciple who returned, their injuries are not light, but not that serious either. They should be fine after a few days of recuperation.”</p>
<p>“Hm, that’s good,” Yang Kai nodded, directing his next question to the crowd, “What do you think is the problem here?”</p>
<p>“What’s the problem?” Wu Yi looked bewildered. Then she retorted, “Everything’s a problem! We have been working with the Shadow Moon Hall for so long without facing a single issue. We pay the Saint Crystals, they sell us the materials and we all mutually benefit. In the last few years, we seem to have already become the largest buyers of Shadow Moon Hall. Normally, they should be trying to maintain our interest instead of causing rifts like this. Not to mention, they wouldn’t have the courage to do so in the first place. I suspect there’s someone behind the scenes giving the orders.”</p>
<p>“I think so too!” Chang Qi agreed, “Dragon Cave Mountain doesn’t have a strong establishment, only plenty of resources. The precious stone lands its innocent possessor in jail. Perhaps Shadow Moon Hall is no longer willing to continue trading with us periodically and instead wishes to take everything that we have in one go?”</p>
<p>“You suspect this is the work of Qian Tong?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s not impossible,” Wu Yi nodded.</p>
<p>“The possibility is there, but I don’t think this has anything to do with him,” Yang Kai shook his head slowly. Out of everyone here, he’d interacted with Qian Tong the most. Regardless of his inherent character, Qian Tong wouldn’t turn against Yang Kai, especially considering his relation with Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er, and how he saved them in the Flowing Flame Sand Field.</p>
<p>“I heard you saying that three months ago, all the Shadow Moon Hall’s stores at the Heavenly Fate City replaced all their store owners and employees? Is that true?” Yang Kai asked again.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right,” Wu Yi nodded immediately, “I often go to Heavenly Fate City, so I’m quite confident about this.”</p>
<p>“In the last six months, did anything peculiar or significant happen at the Shadow Moon Hall?” Yang Kai furrowed his brows.</p>
<p>“If we’re talking about peculiar things, nothing happened at the Shadow Moon Hall, but there’s something going on here. In recent months, a few unfamiliar faces appeared around Dragon Cave Mountain. At first, they were just loitering around the area, but then some of them started trying to breach into our territory. They were caught in the Spirit Array, and all of them said that it was an accident when we questioned them. We decided to release them after a warning since none of them had high cultivation. As for significant things... well, there was one.”</p>
<p>“What?” Yang Kai’s expression grew serious.</p>
<p>“Grandmaster Ge Lin passed away!” Wu Yi lowered her voice.</p>
<p>“Grandmaster Ge Lin?” Yang Kai thought for a while before realizing, “the Low-Rank Origin Grade Artifact Refiner of Shadow Moon Hall?”</p>
<p>“That’s him. This happened half a year ago. According to rumours, Grandmaster Ge Lin had lost a lot of vitality right after repairing an artifact for Shadow Moon Hall, so much so that he hadn’t refined a single artifact these past few years. But what does that have to do with us?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about the exact details, but there might be some connection,” Yang Kai pondered, “I heard from Qian Tong that he was on very good terms with Grandmaster Ge Lin once.”</p>
<p>Wu Yi thought for a moment, “You’re saying that Grandmaster Ge Lin’s passing affected Elder Qian Tong, and since he’s the one who’s been looking out for us, we’re being affected too?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai grinned, “It’s just my guess. It could also be Qian Tong turning on us, but if it really has something to do with Shadow Moon Hall’s internal strife, we should try not to get dragged into the situation.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. We definitely can’t mess with the matters of Shadow Moon Hall,” Wu Yi immediately became more cautious. She hadn’t thought about this this deep before, but with Yang Kai’s help, she was starting to see the underlying issue.</p>
<p>“Any news from Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er?” Yang Kai asked.</p>
<p>Wu Yi shook her head, “All that Shadow Moon Hall said was that they were secluding themselves to break through to the Origin Returning Realm, nothing else.”</p>
<p>“Understandable. Forget it, it’s not good to depend on others anyway. I’ll make a trip to get Yu Feng back. Saint Crystals aside, the people are what’s important.”</p>
<p>“That’s a whole twenty million Saint Crystals gone!” the expression of pain was clearly written on Wu Yi’s face, “So what’s your plan?”</p>
<p>“If they’re not going to be nice, then I’m not going to be nice either. Otherwise, they’ll really think that Dragon Cave Mountain is an easy target,” Yang Kai said coldly.</p>
<p>Wu Yi stared at him, dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Yang Kai merely smiled and waved away her concerns, “If it really is due to internal strife, we have nothing to worry about. They don’t have the time to divert any attention onto us, so there probably aren’t any masters there. Plus, I myself really want to know exactly who is showing such malicious intent towards our Dragon Cave Mountain! What better way to find out than to personally make a trip there?”</p>
<p>“This elder will accompany you!” Chang Qi stood up.</p>
<p>Hao An said, “So will this elder! Even though my and Old Man Chang’s cultivations are nothing special, we’re still Origin Returning cultivators. Ever since we broke through, we haven’t had a single fight yet. This is the perfect opportunity to test our strength.</p>
<p>The two elders looked at each other and smiled.</p>
<p>Yang Kai thought this over before replying, “Alright, then I’m counting on you two Foreign Elders. The rest of you, however, should stay here.”</p>
<p>“Okay, be careful,” Wu Yi warned.</p>
<p>With that settled, Yang Kai exited the bamboo tower with Chang Qi and Hao An, took out his Star Shuttle, and headed straight for Heavenly Fate City.</p>
<p>At Heavenly Fate City, in a room within the inner garden of a store called the Gathering Source Hall, Yu Feng and the rest were tied up. All of them had bruises all over, and not a single strand of Saint Qi could be detected in their bodies. Clearly, they had all been restricted by a strong barrier.</p>
<p>They had been lined up in a single row and forced to kneel on the floor.</p>
<p>In front of them was a malicious looking old man with white hair sitting on a chair of sandalwood and holding a purple teapot in his hands. His eyes were half-closed, as if asleep, but the occasional sparkle of ferocity which could be seen in his eyes proved that he was wide awake.</p>
<p>“Speak. I want to know a safe way into Dragon Cave Mountain. Speak and I will allow you to leave, so you no longer have to suffer.” Beside the old man stood a fierce-looking brute, toying with a long whip with the thickness of three fingers in his hands as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Ptui!” Yu Feng’s reply was a glob of spit mixed with some blood aimed right at the brute’s face, “You want information from me? Dream on! I’d die before handing any information over to you despicable lot!”</p>
<p>The brute stayed still, allowing the glob of spit to run down his face. He smiled viciously, and the whip in his hands suddenly moved, swishing through the air and landing on Yu Feng’s face.</p>
<p>Coupled with a resounding crack, the right side of Yu Feng’s face tore open and a piece of mutilated meat flew out amidst the bloodshed. Yu Feng’s whole body was shaken by the force of the blow, nearly causing him to fall over. However, he quickly straightened back up, roaring with a fierce look in his eyes, “Come on! You can beat me to death today, and you still won’t get anything out of me! Just wait till you rush into Dragon Cave Mountain and get ripped to pieces by the thousands of Spirit Arrays there. Hahahahaha!”</p>
<p>The arrogant laughter caused a look of annoyance to show on the brute’s face, and even the old man seated on the chair was starting to lose his patience.</p>
<h2>1328</h2>
<p>Chapter 1328, Is Your Surname Xie</p>
<p>The old man was a First-Order Origin Returning cultivator. If it weren’t for certain concerns he had, he would have saved himself all this trouble by reading the information from Yu Feng’s mind using a Soul Search.</p>
<p>However, because of said concerns, the old man didn’t dare to kill off anyone just yet. Furthermore, using a Soul Search was exhausting and did not guarantee that one will get the exact piece of information that one is looking for. These factors combined were why he was resorting to these simple methods of interrogation instead.</p>
<p>Seeing how stubborn Yu Feng was, the malicious-looking brute laughed, “Good, good! I like people with guts! You can withstand this torture, but what about them? I’d like to see if everyone is as tough as you are!”</p>
<p>He looked towards the second person, asking the same question as before.</p>
<p>The reply was another glob of bloody spit.</p>
<p>Once again, the whip lashed out, sending the disciple from the Hai Ke Family spinning into the air. He landed heavily on the ground and stayed there for a long while.</p>
<p>Following this, he turned towards the third person, furious to the extreme. He roared, “Make this easy for yourself and give it up! Or else you’ll get what’s coming to you!”</p>
<p>The third Hai Ke Family disciple raised his head and looked him in the eye, expression cold. He had the lowest cultivation out of everyone here, a mere First-Order Saint. With his Saint Qi sealed, a single strike from the whip could mean half a month in bed.</p>
<p>Yu Feng opened his mouth as if wanting to say something, but the disciple cut him off, “Don’t worry, Brother Feng. We haven’t spent that much time at Dragon Cave Mountain, but we have all received great benefits. We won’t be ungrateful traitors. To hell with Shadow Moon Hall. Have they got the means to improve the cultivation of so many people by one or two Minor Realms in such a short period of time?”</p>
<p>“Exactly!” Yu Feng felt a swell of pride and nodded. The disciple was right. The fifty or so Hai Ke Family disciples who separated from the family under the leadership of Wu Yi to join the Dragon Cave Mountain had no worries regarding cultivation resources these past two to three years. They were given an endless supply of various pills and medications and each received at least one or two artifacts, all of which were Saint King Grade. This was infinitely better than what they could have gotten back in the Hai Ke Family.</p>
<p>It can be said that every Hai Ke Family disciple had recognised Dragon Cave Mountain as their home, resulting in a strong sense of belonging.</p>
<p>By now, the brute understood that he was wasting his breath with these questions, and simply raised the whip. Just as he was about to unleash a strike, the old man on the chair suddenly opened his half-closed eyes and turned to look outside.</p>
<p>Boom...</p>
<p>A loud noise was accompanied by several violent pulses of Saint Qi. There appeared to be a fight going on outside, but everything died down after a few cries of shock and agony.</p>
<p>“Who dares trespass the Gathering Source Hall!” The old man’s expression stiffened as he rose from his seat and turned to head out. However, he let out a strange cry midair, flying backwards as if he had suffered a serious injury.</p>
<p>A burst of white light followed after him, landing in the room and heading towards the old man with a tremendous aura.</p>
<p>Shocked, the old man immediately took out a defensive artifact in the shape of a small shield, placing it in front of himself.</p>
<p>A huge blast rang out, causing the old man to stumble back several steps before he was able to disperse the immense force. Looking down at his shield, he couldn’t help but wince.</p>
<p>A small flicker of jet-black flame was burning on this Low-Rank Origin Grade Artifact, and its blazing heat was starting to cause the shield to melt.</p>
<p>This sight frightened him greatly. Had he touched this flame just now, he would have suffered a fatal injury even if he didn’t outright die.</p>
<p>Before he could react, two gusts of Shi descended from the sky, enveloping the whole room. He raised his head and saw the imposing figure of a youth clad in a chilling aura entering the room.</p>
<p>Behind the youth were two old people, both who were First-Order Origin Returning cultivators. The two gusts of Shi from earlier were clearly their doing.</p>
<p>The old man’s eyes widened, knowing that the situation had become unfavourable for him. As a lone First-Order Origin Returning cultivator, there was no way he could handle two other cultivators of the same Realm by himself. Realising this, he immediately took out an item from his Space Ring and crushed it, secretly breathing a sigh of relief as he successfully did so.</p>
<p>“Yang Kai! Foreign Elder Chang, Foreign Elder Hao!” Yu Feng and the rest exclaimed in joy when they saw the intruders.</p>
<p>Yang Kai took a quick look across the room, eyes narrowing as he saw the grievous injuries on several of the detained individuals. Murderous intent welled up within him. He could tell how serious the injuries were, and how they had caused their vitalities to deplete almost to the extent of damaging their foundations. Right now, a few pills and a few days of recuperation could still heal them, but had he come out of seclusion a day or two later, their cultivations would undoubtedly have fallen.</p>
<p>“You’re Yang Kai?” the old man stared at him in shock after hearing their words.</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced at him, showing no interest in answering his question. Instead, he signalled towards Chang Qi.</p>
<p>Chang Qi immediately walked up, condensing Saint Qi onto his fingertips like knives, cutting Yu Feng and the rest out of their bondage. He then checked the restrictive barrier that was placed within their bodies and furrowed his brows.</p>
<p>Although this was merely the work of a fellow First-Order Origin Returning cultivator, it would still take him two to four hours to undo it. Now was clearly not the best time for that.</p>
<p>He brought Yu Feng and the rest back to Yang Kai’s side, and communicated the situation to him in a hushed voice before standing down.</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded, then looked towards the old man. Narrowing his eyes, he said, “You sound like you already know me?”</p>
<p>“Hmph! So what?” the old man grunted.</p>
<p>Yang Kai smirked, then asked, “Is your surname Xie?”</p>
<p>The old man’s expression changed immediately to one of extreme shock, “How do you know?”</p>
<p>“I knew it!” Yang Kai nodded, a look of understanding spreading across his face. He had guessed it earlier when talking with Wu Yi and the rest about the situation. If there really was internal strife in Shadow Moon Hall, the Dragon Cave Mountain shouldn’t have been affected to this much of an extent.</p>
<p>After all, Dragon Cave Mountain was a major customer, meaning that there’s nothing but benefit in cooperating with them. No one would make an enemy of them without any reason like this.</p>
<p>Yang Kai instinctively felt that anyone who would stand against Dragon Cave Mountain so brazenly must be someone with a grievance against him. That, together with the criteria of being related to Shadow Moon Hall, narrowed the choices down to a single one: the Xie Family.</p>
<p>Xie Hong Wen had been a disciple of Shadow Moon Hall, while his father, Xie Li, was a Deacon. His status was not as high as Qian Tong, but it did give him some degree of power.</p>
<p>The Xie Family was a faction independent from Shadow Moon Hall, but these two definitely shared some connections.</p>
<p>As for why they would antagonize Yang Kai, there were two reasons. Firstly, out of suspicion that Xie Hong Wen’s death had something to do with him. After all, Xie Hong Wen died in the Flowing Flame Sand Field after a Shadow Moon Hall disciple told him about Yang Kai’s location there, which was enough for the Xie Family to believe that Yang Kai had something to do with his death. They probably refrained from causing Yang Kai trouble so far because they were apprehensive of Qian Tong and that Origin Grade Artifact Refiner.</p>
<p>Secondly, they probably wanted to take this chance to test the waters with Qian Tong!</p>
<p>If Qian Tong still had the time to look after Dragon Cave Mountain, he would have long since done so. It would, therefore, seem that he wasn’t in a favourable situation either.</p>
<p>Yang Kai quickly deduced the possible state of affairs based on his own assumptions. Even though he couldn’t be completely certain whether that was the truth just yet, it shouldn’t be far off. He just had to ask around a little afterwards to make sure.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Yang Kai’s mood improved slightly. As long as it wasn’t Qian Tong acting against him, it was fine. Moreover, since the Xie Family was the main mastermind, it must mean that the strife in Shadow Moon Hall was quite serious. Not only was Qian Tong occupied, but his opponent also didn’t have the time to care about this either.</p>
<p>In that case, Yang Kai had no more concerns. The current Dragon Cave Mountain had no problem handling a mere Xie Family. If they came at him, he would give them a reason to be sorry.</p>
<p>“I am Xie Quan!” The old man realised his slip-up and stopped trying to hide it altogether. He laughed coldly, “You’re quite bold for daring to destroy the Gathering Source Hall even after knowing that I’m from the Xie Family!”</p>
<p>“Xie Family... Hehe...” Yang Kai laughed for a while. Stroking his chin, he asked Yu Feng, “Who beat you up?”</p>
<p>Yu Feng looked stunned for a while, before pointing at the brute behind Xie Quan.</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded, face twisting into a rage. He flicked his wrist, sending a thin golden thread flying straight at the brute.</p>
<p>Xie Quan’s expression changed, and he exclaimed, “How insolent!”</p>
<p>At the same time, a wave of Shi burst from his body, and he sent several bursts of energy towards the golden thread with flicks of his fingers.</p>
<p>He thought that it would be easy to disperse the attack of a Third-Order Saint King. In fact, releasing his Shi was beyond necessary.</p>
<p>However, his eyes grew wide in shock the next moment. The golden thread tore his Shi to shreds, nullifying the bursts of energy completely.</p>
<p>That’s when he understood that he had underestimated his opponent. He hurriedly took out an artifact in the shape of a top. As it spun, wave after wave of light rays shot out from it, forming a protective layer in front of the brute in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>As an Origin Returning cultivator, it would be too shameful to allow Yang Kai to capture someone right in front of him.</p>
<p>However, yet another shocking scene unfolded. The protective shield was not able to stop the advance of the golden thread, shattering to pieces as it made contact. In the next moment, the brute shouted in surprise as he was pulled towards Yang Kai with immense force.</p>
<p>“Put him down!” Xie Quan’s face was fuming red. Channelling the Saint Qi within his body, he struck his palm towards Yang Kai, materializing a gigantic palm print in the process, as if trying to flatten Yang Kai completely.</p>
<p>Yang Kai laughed coldly and pushed his own palm forward.</p>
<p>Another gigantic palm print materialized, meeting Xie Quan’s own head on. Not only did it swallow Xie Quan’s palm print entirely, it advanced towards Xie Quan with an intensity that seemed to cover Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p>Xie Quan’s eyes were almost popping out of their sockets. Never had he thought that a Third-Order Saint King could face him head-on, not to mention gain the upper hand in the process!</p>
<h2>1329</h2>
<p>Chapter 1329, Take Revenge for Your Grudges</p>
<p>In a flash, the brute had been captured and brought to Yang Kai’s side, his eyes wide in an expression of horror.</p>
<p>As a Third-Order Saint King, it was terrifying how powerless he was in front of this youth who was at the same cultivation level as him. Only now did he remember to try and resist, but just as he was gathering up his Saint Qi, Yang Kai tapped lightly on his shoulder, causing the brute to turn pale and let out a grunt, the energy he was trying to summon dispersing all over again.</p>
<p>Following that, Yang Kai sent him flying in front of Yu Feng and the rest with a single kick. He grabbed the whip from him and threw it over to Yu Feng, speaking coldly, “Take revenge for your grudges!”</p>
<p>Yu Feng caught the thick whip, looking stunned for a moment before regaining his bearings. He exchanged a glance with the fellow detainees who had been beaten and surrounded the brute while grinning maliciously.</p>
<p>The next moment, the brute’s pitiful cries of pain rang out amidst the sounds of kicks and punches and the cracks of the whip.</p>
<p>Xie Quan’s face was dark with anger while eyes shining with a fierce glow, as if looking for prey to release his anger upon. He looked at Yang Kai, “Youths are reckless indeed. Good, I shall see how long you can maintain that arrogance!”</p>
<p>As he said that, he waved his hand. All of a sudden, numerous figures started appearing from all around the place. There were at least several dozen of them, and they surrounded the now decimated Gathering Source Hall, glaring at Yang Kai’s group with animosity. Although there were no Origin Returning Realm cultivators amidst the group, the large number was enough to cause Chang Qi and Hao An to feel uneasy.</p>
<p>Not only that, but many people from all around Heavenly Fate City were starting to fly towards them, and there was no lack of Origin Returning cultivators amongst those.</p>
<p>In a mere moment, the situation had flipped. Where Yang Kai’s side originally had a slight advantage, it was now completely lost in terms of both numbers and cultivation.</p>
<p>Chang Qi scanned his surroundings, his expression growing sombre as he did. There were seven to eight Origin Returning cultivators here, and they were all reinforcements Xie Quan had called. Reinforcements were within expectations. After all, they were heading deep into the enemy camp with this trip, and it would be impossible to expect there to be no backup. However, the scale of it was completely unexpected.</p>
<p>He stole a glance at Yang Kai, only to find him looking calm and composed as always. This surprised Chang Qi a little but also gave him a bit of confidence. Surely, Yang Kai had some kind of trump card hidden away.</p>
<p>“Brother Xie, is this the brat who destroyed the Gathering Source Hall?” one of the newcomers was an old man sporting a goatee, and he asked this question coldly while staring at Yang Kai after exchanging quick greetings with Xie Quan.</p>
<p>Xie Quan made a fist palm salute, saying, “Regretfully so. I didn’t expect there to be two Origin Returning cultivators with him, and I alone was no match and could not protect this place. I will apologize to Shadow Moon Hall after this.”</p>
<p>The goateed old man laughed and waved his hand in dismissal, “Don’t take this too seriously, brother Xie. With such a grand scale of the enterprise, our Shadow Moon Hall wouldn’t care so much about the destruction of a mere Gathering Source Hall. More importantly, your junior looks to be in quite the predicament.”</p>
<p>He shifted his gaze towards the group who was still beating up the brute. Speaking sharply and coldly, he said, “Are you not being too contemptuous by continuing with your acts of violence even after we have arrived? This old master is asking you to stop!”</p>
<p>With that, a spark of light flashed across his eyes, and an imposing gust of spiritual energy descended from the heavens towards Yu Feng’s group.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chang Qi smirked and channelled out his own spiritual energy, causing the two gusts to clash midair and disperse silently. As a fellow First-Order Origin Returning cultivator, he would obviously have no fear of meeting the attack, and this particular clash hence ended in a draw.</p>
<p>Yu Feng and the rest couldn’t help but stop, and they collectively looked towards Yang Kai. This was the first time they had been surrounded by so many Origin Returning cultivators, and it was making them anxious.</p>
<p>“Go on. Don’t stop until you feel like the grudge has been completely settled!” Yang Kai glanced nonchalantly at the numerous Origin Returning cultivators, the condescending look in his eyes eliciting widespread displeasure from them.</p>
<p>The goateed old man was about to say something, but Yang Kai interrupted him, “You’re from the Shadow Moon Hall?”</p>
<p>“That’s right!” the old man stroked his beard, “This old master, Ma Xin Yuan, is a Lower Manager of Shadow Moon Hall.”</p>
<p>“Lower Manager...” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, the edges of his mouth rising in mockery, “May I ask where Elder Qian Tong is right now?”</p>
<p>“Elder Qian...” Ma Xin Yuan’s expression changed slightly, as if he were slightly apprehensive. This reaction was shared by most of the Origin Returning cultivators gathered around. Seeing this, Yang Kai immediately realized that this group of cultivators were not under Qian Tong. They were probably on opposing sides within Shadow Moon Hall, otherwise, they would not have shown such expressions.</p>
<p>Looks like his prior deductions regarding the situation have been quite accurate.</p>
<p>“Elder Qian is naturally standing guard within Shadow Moon Hall. Listen up, brat! Not only did you destroy the Gathering Source Hall, you also injured our men. Don’t think that you can get away with this just by saying that you know Elder Qian. You’re not getting away today no matter what!” A middle-aged man towards the right exclaimed.</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced at him and laughed lightly, “Of course I will not leave until the matter is settled. I came here today for two reasons.”</p>
<p>He pointed towards Yu Feng and the rest as he spoke, “To bring them back, and collect the resources you owe us while I’m at it.”</p>
<p>The numerous Origin Returning cultivators looked at one another, seeing the amusement in each other’s eyes. A few of them couldn’t help but laugh out loud, mocking Yang Kai’s inability to understand the extent of his own powers.</p>
<p>Xie Quan smirked at Yang Kai, “Such arrogance. Did you say you were going to bring them back? Have you asked whether this master agrees to that?”</p>
<p>“If you dare disagree, I will beat you until you change your mind!” Yang Kai exclaimed as he pointed his hand out. An artifact resembling an Artifact Refining Furnace appeared out of thin air, causing the temperature within a thousand-metre radius to rise rapidly. It caused everyone to feel as if they had suddenly fallen into a sea of fire, and even the air was being distorted due to the heat.</p>
<p>The next moment, a sharp shriek sounded out from within the furnace, and a ten-metre long Firebird of bright scarlet flew out. As it spread its wings, all the Fire Attribute World Energy in the Heavenly Fate City seemed to be pulled towards it, gathering within its body.</p>
<p>No one could have expected Yang Kai to be so daring as to make the first move even under such a clearly disadvantageous situation.</p>
<p>It was only after the Firebird absorbed the World Energy, growing to a massive size of over thirty metres, and starting to cover up the sky that the group of Origin Returning cultivators began to regain their senses. Xie Quan, in particular, was staring at the firebird with shaking eyes, exclaiming in shock, “Artifact Spirit! It’s an Artifact Spirit!”</p>
<p>No sooner had he finished speaking, that the Firebird spit a fireball the size of a washbasin at him.</p>
<p>The Artifact Spirit Firebird had awoken a month ago, which was one of the better pieces of news during the period of Yang Kai’s seclusion. After absorbing a strand of Sun’s True Fire, not only did it become more sapient, its strength increased drastically as well.</p>
<p>At the very least, the power of its flames was thirty percent stronger than when Yang Kai first obtained it.</p>
<p>Xie Quan’s face drained of all colour as he stared at the fireball approaching with an earth-crushing force. Completely tense against the imminent threat of death, he hurriedly took out his Defensive Artifact in hopes of mitigating the impact, at the same time turning and running away as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Boom...</p>
<p>With a loud explosion, the fireball crashed down. The Defensive Artifact was not even able to hold for a single second before becoming badly damaged, losing all its lustre. A large pit appeared on the ground, the edges of which still showed signs of melting.</p>
<p>“This Artifact Spirit is fierce! Everyone, attack it together!” Xie Quan knew immediately that he would be no match for the Artifact Spirit.</p>
<p>Hearing this, the other Origin Returning cultivators all took out their artifacts, preparing to gang up on the Firebird. Everyone had a glint of excitement in their eyes, and no one bothered to direct any more attention towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>In their eyes, the only reason why Yang Kai would so fearlessly go on the offensive was due to this Artifact Spirit. As long as they subdue it, what was a single Third-Order Saint King to them?</p>
<p>Furthermore, subduing this Artifact Spirit would benefit them greatly. In front of such a precious treasure, who had the time to care about Yang Kai?</p>
<p>Seeing that, Yang Kai laughed coldly and, with a wave of both hands, sent blasts of black fireballs shooting in all directions, causing the rest of the cultivators to fall all over the place. Where the Demonic Flames passed, everything ignited spontaneously. The ones with quicker reactions were able to scatter, while the ones who were too slow were swallowed whole by the flames, not a single bone remaining of them.</p>
<p>In an instant, this region of Heavenly Fate City had turned into a sea of fire, the intensity of the blaze threatening to burn a hole in the very heavens.</p>
<p>“Run!” Yang Kai shouted towards Chang Qi and Hao An.</p>
<p>The two of them took out their Star Shuttles, immediately dragging Yu Feng and the rest onto them. Mobilizing their Saint Qi, they headed straight out of Heavenly Fate City with the ex-detainees in tow.</p>
<p>“Stop them!” How could that goateed old man called Ma Xin Yuan allow them to escape from right under his eyes? With a single flash of the long sword held in his hand, he sent several bursts of Sword Waves towards Chang Qi and Hao Ao.</p>
<p>Yang Kai laughed coldly, immediately bringing out his purple shield and injecting Saint Qi into it. A gust of sandstorm immediately encased Chang Qi and the rest within it, protecting them. At the same time, Yang Kai sent out a hasty message to Chang Qi.</p>
<p>Chang Qi stared back for a moment before flying forward again at full speed, disappearing together with Hao An, Yu Feng, and the rest of the disciples.</p>
<p>The only one left on the ground was the brute who whipped them earlier, now howling in pain. He was mutilated beyond recognition and looked wretched to the extreme.</p>
<p>Yang Kai flicked a single burst of Demonic Flame at him with a single finger, causing him to burn away without a trace from the world. Yang Kai was not going to be merciful to someone from the Xie Family.</p>
<h2>1330</h2>
<p>Chapter 1330, Settling Grudges</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain &amp; Dhael Ligerkeys</p>
<p>“Little Brat! How dare you kill a disciple of the Xie Family!” Xie Quan raged when he saw Yang Kai kill the brute.</p>
<p>“So what if I did? What can you do?!” Yang Kai’s expression was one of ferocity. The Demonic Flame shrouded his body, making it look like a savage god descended from the heavens, thirsting for blood.</p>
<p>As he spoke, he fired a strand of Saint Qi into the Origin King Grade Artifact Refining Furnace floating in the air, causing it to start spinning. As it spun, bursts of flames emerged one after another, transforming into the shape of Firebirds and shooting out.</p>
<p>Those Firebirds were like miniature versions of the Artifact Spirit, looking very much the same, other than the smaller size and lower power. This was the Fire Attribute World Energy stored within the Origin King Grade Artifact Refining Furnace itself. After spending tens of thousands of years burning within the Earth Lung Fire Pond, it was no ordinary item. Usually, Yang Kai only needed to release the Artifact Spirit in order to deal with his enemies, but against so many Origin Returning Realm masters, he didn’t dare to be careless, opting to invoke the force of the Furnace as well.</p>
<p>The Artifact Spirit Firebird spread both wings, causing countless fireballs to form and swarm towards the enemies like a cloud of locusts.</p>
<p>The combination of the two caused the many Origin Returning Realm masters to scramble in fear.</p>
<p>The already blazing Heavenly Fate City suffered even greater losses from this. All the houses and shops within a thousand-metre radius turned to ashes, leaving a seared, pitch-black wasteland where they once stood. Ten or so cultivators were too slow to avoid the attack and died on the spot.</p>
<p>Several gusts of Shi descended from the heavens, and Xie Quan exclaimed in fury, “Little brat! Now that those two old farts are gone, let’s see how a mere Saint King like you can escape!”</p>
<p>The pressure from more than ten layers of Shi stacked together caused Yang Kai to feel like he was completely unable to move. In response, two strands of Golden Thread shot out, furiously cutting away the formless Shi, causing their strength to decrease drastically. With that, Yang Kai took another step forward, his body suddenly blurring away, causing all of the Origin Returning cultivators to be unable to perceive where he went.</p>
<p>He was invoking the Space Force. Although this was not directly tearing space, it was enough to free him from the usual restrictions of space.</p>
<p>When he next appeared, he was already behind Xie Quan.</p>
<p>“Brother Xie, watch out!” No sooner had Yang Kai appeared than the goateed old man shouted.</p>
<p>Xie Quan similarly realized this, his expression changing to shock. A layer of white mist suddenly emerged from his body, wrapping around him and concealing his figure. Yang Kai snorted in disdain, letting a single strand of Golden Thread fly out and wrap around the white mist.</p>
<p>A small bursting sound rang out, followed by Xie Quan’s scream. The layer of white mist condensed, then spontaneously erupted, causing his figure to appear once again.</p>
<p>When the crowd registered the scene before them, they gasped in shock.</p>
<p>Xie Quan was standing at his original position, his face ashen. He stared blankly at the single strand of Golden Threaded passing right through his chest, shock written all over his expression. His eyes were filled with apprehension, and he did not dare move even a finger.</p>
<p>The other end of the Golden Thread was wrapped around Yang Kai’s finger.</p>
<p>He was so easily subdued by Yang Kai! Not only was it unexpected to the rest, but even Xie Quan himself did not imagine that he would fall so easily. All he knew was that the Golden Thread had mysterious properties and was sharp beyond measure. The Saint Qi protecting his body could not block it at all, or else he would not have been pierced by it so easily.</p>
<p>A sharp shriek came from overhead once again, and the gigantic Artifact Spirit Firebird moved to hover over Yang Kai’s head, its eyes scanning the area around it. Every Origin Returning Realm cultivator who met its gaze turned white in fear. Though their fight with it had not been long, everyone had realised how scary it was. One-on-one, not a single one of them was a match for it, and even if they teamed up, it was impossible to subjugate it. Even if this Artifact Spirit was not as strong as a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, it was close.</p>
<p>“Move and you die.” Yang Kai’s voice sounded to Xie Quan like the cold wind blowing from the ninth pit of hell, sending a shiver down his spine.</p>
<p>Seeing that Xie Quan was obeying his instructions and standing there quietly, a look of satisfaction flashed across Yang Kai’s face. He then turned to the other Origin Returning Realm cultivators, and said, “I told you, I came here for two things. The first is done, now the second.”</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Xie Quan said bitterly.</p>
<p>“Return all of the Saint Crystals that you took from my Dragon Cave Mountain!” Yang Kai said coldly.</p>
<p>“Your Saint Crystals are in my Space Ring. Take it if you want.” Xie Quan said through clenched teeth. He had no choice but to obey Yang Kai right now.</p>
<p>Yang Kai glanced at his finger and sent the other Golden Thread out. It wrapped around Xie Quan’s finger, and in the next moment, both the ring and his finger landed onto Yang Kai’s palm.</p>
<p>Fresh blood spurted out, but Xie Quan could only clench his teeth and bear with the pain, not daring to make a single move.</p>
<p>Yang Kai scanned the contents of the ring with his Divine Sense, a smirk forming on his face, “Isn’t the quantity a little low?”</p>
<p>Not just a little, half of it was gone. The materials that Dragon Cave Mountain had ordered from Shadow Moon Hall this time around were worth twenty million Saint Crystals, yet only ten million could be found within the ring, with the rest nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Xie Quan remained silent, but he glanced towards the goateed old man Ma Xin Yuan. Immediately, Yang Kai understood that they had already split the Saint Crystals that Yu Feng had brought, and the remaining half was probably on him. He stared coldly towards Ma Xin Yuan.</p>
<p>Ma Xin Yuan’s face was one of hesitation and unwillingness. Obviously, he wasn’t too happy to simply give up the profits he had just obtained. A whole ten million Saint Crystals! If it weren’t for this, why would Shadow Moon Hall assist the Xie Family in fighting against Yang Kai? Especially when the internal strife had gotten so heated that very few people could be sent out to deal with external affairs.</p>
<p>Seeing how he looked like he didn’t want to hand the Saint Crystals over, Yang Kai’s expression hardened, the second Golden Thread flying out once again and wrapping around Xie Quan’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Bathed in blood, Xie Quan’s arm fell to the ground. Everyone paled immediately, looking at Yang Kai in disbelief, not expecting him to be so ruthless as to inflict such a grievous injury without saying a single word.</p>
<p>Xie Quan had the tenacity to stay silent, at least. He didn’t make a single noise when his finger was cut off earlier, and similarly not when this whole arm was chopped off. All he did was to turn towards Ma Xin Yuan in anger, his dry lips cracking as he exclaimed, “Brother Ma! Are you simply going to watch as I get dissected by this little brat?”</p>
<p>At this point, Ma Xin Yuan knew that he could no longer keep the Saint Crystals for himself. The Xie Family still had Xie Li within the Shadow Moon Hall, whose position was even higher than his own. If he really allowed Xie Quan to die at the hands of Yang Kai, Xie Li would definitely come for him.</p>
<p>Clenching his teeth, he took the Space Ring off of his finger, taking out his personal belongings and throwing it over to Yang Kai as he spoke vehemently, “Little brat, the rest of the Saint Crystals are all in there. Now release him, unless you want a fight to the death!”</p>
<p>They initially thought that they had everything in control, only to have the entire plan come undone by the Artifact Spirit. Even this little brat called Yang Kai was extremely strange. Up until now, Ma Xin Yuan still hadn’t figured out how he was able to attack Xie Quan and subdue him.</p>
<p>While cursing Xie Quan’s carelessness, he was also starting to feel a little apprehension towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>If he was able to subdue Xie Quan just like that, there’s a chance that he might be able to kill him. After all, he wasn’t much stronger than Xie Quan.</p>
<p>[Is he really a Third-Order Saint King?] Ma Xin Yuan had strong suspicions that Yang Kai was hiding his cultivation. Looking at how relaxed he was, it was clear that he still hadn’t played all his cards.</p>
<p>Catching the ring that Ma Xin Yuan threw over, Yang Kai did a quick check to make sure he didn’t lie, before nodding and keeping both rings. He ignored Ma Xin Yuan’s threat entirely, instead saying, “Now that I have the Saint Crystals back for, let’s settle the other grudge!”</p>
<p>“What is there to settle?” Ma Xin Yuan’s expression darkened.</p>
<p>“Don’t play dumb with me,” Yang Kai snickered, “detaining the disciples of Dragon Cave Mountain, even going as far as to whip them. After causing them such injuries, did you think I was going to let this go?”</p>
<p>“Injuries...” Ma Xin Yuan roared in anger, “if that’s the case, what about all these shops you destroyed? The disciples you killed? Should I settle things with you as well?!”</p>
<p>“That’s your own fault. Our Dragon Cave Mountain has been fairly trading with you these past two years, never lagging behind on Saint Crystal payments, and yet you abuse our trust in such a way. Just try getting the word out. No one will side with you.”</p>
<p>“Alright then. State your terms!” Ma Xin Yuan seethed.</p>
<p>“Pay up!” Yang Kai went straight to the point, “If not, let’s see if you are prepared to face the consequences!”</p>
<p>“Are you threatening this old master, you little brat?!” Ma Xin Yuan shouted.</p>
<p>“Yes!” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes at him, “I’ll count to three. Disagree, and negotiations are over. One...”</p>
<p>Seeing how unrelenting Yang Kai was, to the point that he was actually starting to count, all the Origin Returning Realm cultivators’ expressions turned cold, a sense of helplessness arising despite their anger. Originally, they thought that their forces were more than enough to take down Dragon Cave Mountain, but things soon got out of hand.</p>
<p>“Two...”</p>
<p>When this number sounded out, Xie Quan started yelling urgently, “Brother Ma...”</p>
<p>Ma Xin Yuan looked at him from afar, an ambiguous expression flashing across his face as he said, “Brother Xie, it was a disciple of your Xie Family who caught and injured them, right? This doesn’t have much to do with Shadow Moon Hall, don’t you agree?”</p>
<p>Xie Quan looked stunned, then immediately felt a pang of anguish. While Ma Xin Yuan was technically correct in that the main perpetrators who engineered this episode against Dragon Cave Mountain were the Xie Family, the way he was shifting all the blame was still too hurtful. After all, they only proceeded with the plan after receiving orders to take the opportunity to test Qian Tong’s response. Either way, Ma Xin Yuan shouldn’t be trying to distance himself completely from this affair.</p>
<p>“Three!” Yang Kai grinned after reaching the last number, “looks like you’re not willing to pay up. Well then, allow me to collect it myself!”</p>
<p>As he said that, the Golden Thread on his hand trembled slightly, and amidst the golden radiance that seems to fill the skies, Xie Quan turned into a pile of mincemeat.</p>
<p>As the smell of blood wafted out, all the Origin Returning Realm cultivators stared in shock.</p>
<h2>1331</h2>
<p>Chapter 1331, The City Lord of Heavenly Fate City</p>
<p>Nobody expected Yang Kai to kill Xie Quan.</p>
<p>The Origin Returning Realm masters had not dared to act carelessly just now for two reasons. Firstly, there was the threat of the Artifact Spirit Firebird. Secondly, Xie Quan had been subdued by Yang Kai. They acted cautiously out of fear that Yang Kai might kill Xie Quan out of anger. After all, everyone had seen how brutal Yang Kai was. If Xie Quan really died here, it would become a problem with Xie Li later on.</p>
<p>But now, this was no longer a concern, and ironically, Yang Kai was the one who removed the concern for them. This was not just unexpected, it was infuriating as well! Only now did they realise that they had completely underestimated this youth’s madness and insolence!</p>
<p>Without Xie Quan as a hostage, did he really think that he was a match for so many Origin Returning Realm masters? The thought of Xie Li’s anger when he learned of the deaths of Xie Quan and the Xie Family disciples further agitated the crowd. Ma Xin Yuan pointed several times at Yang Kai, seemingly too enraged to speak. After a long while, he finally spoke through clenched teeth, “You’re dead, brat. You’re really dead.”</p>
<p>“Brother Ma, stop wasting your breath with him. Let’s just capture him and bring him to Manager Xie,” someone spoke coldly from aside.</p>
<p>“You think you can?” Yang Kai laughed boldly. If Chang Qi and the rest were still here, he might have some trouble, but now that he was the only one left, not even a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm would be able to stop him. Having cultivated Space Force, he could escape by tearing space anytime.</p>
<p>The situation this time was nothing like that time in the Corpse Cave, where he not only had to bring Yang Yan with him but also face off an opponent on the level of a Thousand-Year Corpse General.</p>
<p>There were only seven or eight First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators here. They would be dreaming if they thought that they could capture Yang Kai.</p>
<p>“Let me turn Heavenly Fate City upside down before I settle my grudges with you!” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly grew cold, raising his hand and commanding, “Burn it!”</p>
<p>The Artifact Spirit Bird raised its head towards the sky and let out a long shriek when it received the command. The flames on its body blazed, and the Fire Attribute World Energy started converging onto it once again. In a flash, it had become even larger.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the Origin Returning Realm cultivators turned pale, hastily covering their bodies with Saint Qi and summoning their own defensive artifacts in order to protect themselves.</p>
<p>The Firebird opened its mouth wide, a huge ball of light forming within. After a moment, the ball turned into a beam of fire that burst out with frightening force, its temperature almost high enough to melt space itself.</p>
<p>The target of the attack was not any cultivator, but the largest store in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was actually planning on turning the entire Heavenly Fate City upside down. Given how badly the people of Dragon Cave Mountain had been bullied, there was no way he could back down. Doing so would only leave an impression of weakness, making them the prime choice as a target in the future.</p>
<p>After all, this could be considered Dragon Cave Mountain’s first fight since its establishment!</p>
<p>Before the beam of fire reached the store, the latter had already been set ablaze by the high temperatures. Suddenly, a beam of light shot out from far away, reaching the store before the fire, causing a thin layer of energy to surround the building.</p>
<p>This was the defensive barrier of the store, which can be considered a kind of Spirit Array. All of the larger stores in Heavenly Fate City had this, but the strength of the barrier depended on the profits of the store in question.</p>
<p>The barrier of this particular store clearly wasn’t weak. It was emitting a light green glow like ripples of water, obviously a work of intricate design.</p>
<p>Even so, when the fire came into contact with the barrier, it shook and broke apart almost immediately. The green glow dimmed quickly, and it didn’t even last a few seconds before shattering into pieces.</p>
<p>The remaining fire roared straight down towards the shop.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an artifact looking like a Round Bowl appeared, growing to a size of several dozens of metres in midair and intercepting the fire right above the shop.</p>
<p>Unable to change its course, the fire shot right into the Bowl. Following this, a flash of blue light shone out from within the Bowl, rounding the fire into a ball and suppressing it within. A middle-aged man dressed like a scholar then appeared above the Round Bowl, his expression sombre to the extreme. He shot several bursts of Saint Qi towards the Round Bowl, and with the activation of his Divine Sense, the Bowl quickly shrank to its original size.</p>
<p>With a wave of his hand, the middle-aged scholar summoned the Round Bowl back to his palm, staring at the fire raging within with a disturbed expression.</p>
<p>“You’ve finally shown yourself!” Yang Kai snorted coldly. He did not make any further moves, instead choosing to stand there and glare at the middle-aged scholar.</p>
<p>He had sensed the scholar’s presence the moment he stepped foot into Heavenly Fate City. After all, the scholar had the cultivation of Third-Order Origin Returning Realm!</p>
<p>Other than him, there was no one else in the entire Heavenly Fate City whom Yang Kai was apprehensive about. Otherwise, he would not have acted so fearlessly before.</p>
<p>The only thing he could not understand was how the scholar did not seem to have any intention of showing himself despite everything that Yang Kai was doing. However, Yang Kai had kept track of him, and now that the store was almost going to be destroyed, the scholar finally could not bear to stay hidden any longer.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not yet know whether he was friend or foe, but he instinctively felt that he did not mean any harm, or else he would have come out long ago.</p>
<p>“Blue Jade Bowl!”</p>
<p>“City Lord Fei!”</p>
<p>The exclamations of the First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators gave away the identity of the scholar.</p>
<p>The City Lord of Heavenly Fate City, Fei Zhi Tu!</p>
<p>Although Yang Kai has never interacted with him before, he had heard of his name. Back when he was having a conflict with the Hai Ke and Xu Families, the two Families once went to the City Lord’s Mansion to ask for help. While they were not able to meet Fei Zhi Tu in the end, Patriarch Yi En from the Hai Ke Family bumped into Xie Hong Wen there and managed to drag him into the conflict.</p>
<p>Yang Kai only knew him from Wu Yi’s introductions, and even then he didn’t know that he was a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm.</p>
<p>Looking at him, Yang Kai finally felt a sense of apprehension. The Blue Jade Bowl, being able to contain the attack of the Firebird, was clearly of a rather high grade and he, himself, had an unbelievably deep aura comparable to that of Qian Tong’s.</p>
<p>Just because he had the ability to act as he wanted under the eyes of seven to eight First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators didn’t mean that he could do the same before a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master. However, he also didn’t have any plans to retreat before confirming the standpoint of the scholar. There were still trump cards that he had not yet played, such as the Space Blade and the Blossoming Lotus Secret Technique.</p>
<p>The crowd’s expression changed slightly when they recognised Fei Zhi Tu, and immediately stepped forward to pay their respects. Ma Xin Yuan said, “City Lord, Sir, I heard that you were cultivating a Secret Technique in retreat? Does this mean that you have succeeded?”</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu took a slow look at him, replying, “Why, is Steward Ma interested in the Secret Technique of this City Lord?”</p>
<p>“No, no, it was just a random question,” Ma Xin Yuan flinched and decided to stop talking.</p>
<p>“Hmph!” Fei Zhi Tu looked at the First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators one by one, speaking in slight mockery, “If this City Lord had not appeared, were you planning on taking apart this entire Heavenly Fate City?”</p>
<p>“We apologise, City Lord!” The crowd cupped their hands and responded immediately after hearing that. One of them stepped forward to explain, “There’s a reason for all of this. It is not our fault that the stores ended up in this state, but that insolent brat’s reckless actions that caused this. We ask you to be fair in your judgements, City Lord, Sir!”</p>
<p>He pointed towards Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu turned to look at Yang Kai. While he was somewhat surprised at the fact that Yang Kai met his gaze without fear, he did not show it, instead scolding, “What a bunch of useless garbage! You call yourselves Origin Returning Realm cultivators when you can’t even handle a single Saint King Realm brat? I can’t believe you’ve still got the face to be here. Even dogs can do better than you!”</p>
<p>The seven or eight Origin Returning Realm cultivators all lowered their heads without saying a single word, a feeling of indignation growing in their hearts.</p>
<p>After scolding them, Fei Zhi Tu finally turned to Yang Kai and laughed dryly, “And aren’t you a brave little brat? Daring to wreak all this havoc in the Heavenly Fate City as if I didn’t exist?”</p>
<p>“Please understand, Senior. I was only forced to engage in a little bit of self-defence because this group of dishonest people were bullying me,” Yang Kai replied indifferently.</p>
<p>“A little bit of self-defence...” Fei Zhi Tu’s face twitched slightly. He had seen the whole exchange while he was in hiding. It was not so much self-defence as it was Yang Kai toying with the Origin Returning Realm cultivators. [What a shameless brat], he thought, lying with a straight face. “I heard you saying that you wanted to turn Heavenly Fate City upside down?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai cringed, “That was merely a bad choice of words due to all the anger I was feeling just now. Surely, you are too magnanimous of a person to take it seriously. Right, Sir?”</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu took a deep breath, laughing coldly, “I don’t care if it was just a bad choice of words. What’s said is said. Either you actually turn Heavenly Fate City upside down today, or you accept a punishment. Otherwise, you won’t be leaving this place that easily.”</p>
<p>Hearing that, Yang Kai’s expression hardened. After a moment’s thought, he smiled, “If that’s the case, then I shall be so bold as to ask for your instructions!”</p>
<p>With such a high cultivation master here, he certainly wouldn’t be able to keep causing trouble. However, from the implied message within Fei Zhi Tu’s words, it seemed that he wasn’t exactly an enemy.</p>
<p>The other Origin Returning Realm cultivators weren’t idiots either, and they clearly understood Fei Zhi Tu’s unspoken message. The City Lord was trying to call a truce with Yang Kai. Ma Xin Yuan’s heart jumped at the thought, and he was just about to speak up when Fei Zhi Tu said, “You’ve killed quite a few people and burned a number of shops. Even if the Shadow Moon Hall was in the wrong, this should be more than enough revenge for you. Originally, things would end here, but if word got out that I let you off just like this, people will assume that this City Lord is but a mere coward.”</p>
<p>“I understand!” Yang Kai nodded.</p>

<p>Chapter 1332, One Move</p>

<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain &amp; Dhael Ligerkeys</p>
<p>Seeing how collaborative Yang Kai was being, Fei Zhi Tu showed a look of approval. When observing the little brat earlier, he had thought Yang Kai was an utterly lawless rebel, but as it turned out, he was quite the perceptive fellow, so his efforts did not go to waste.</p>
<p>Even though many stores in the city were indeed burned down, those were ultimately replaceable and could be easily reconstructed afterwards. As for the people who died, most were disciples of the Xie Family, who didn’t have much to do with Fei Zhi Tu. In fact, even if everybody here died, it didn’t really matter much to him.</p>
<p>After a moment of thought, Fei Zhi Tu said, “I shall give you two choices. You pick one.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai immediately started acting as if he were listening attentively.</p>
<p>“One, use the Saint Crystals you obtained just now as reimbursement. I can’t simply let you go after all that destruction, but those Saint Crystals should be enough as a fine. What do you say?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the expressions of the goateed old man and the rest immediately changed. Their worry was real, and City Lord Fei was indeed intending to let Yang Kai off lightly! Remembering the rumours that were going around the Hall, they seemed to understand something, and nobody dared to speak.</p>
<p>Yang Kai looked stunned for a moment, then tilted his head in thought for a while before replying with a confident smile, “That is a great suggestion, Senior, but I’m afraid I would like to reject it.”</p>
<p>“Hm?” Fei Zhi Tu narrowed his eyes, staring at Yang Kai in surprise. Honestly speaking, the only reason he would make such a suggestion was that he was the strongest of everyone here, and the City Lord on top of that, which meant that Ma Xin Yuan and the rest were unlikely to raise any objections. However, he didn’t expect the little brat to reject his goodwill entirely, making him slightly annoyed. While silently berating Yang Kai for not understanding the severity of the situation, he snorted coldly, “You dare reject it even before hearing the other option?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai replied seriously, “The reason why I came here today was to take back the Saint Crystals which were stolen. Now that I have them, there’s no way I will give them back. Please tell me what the second choice is, Senior.”</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu stared at him for a long while before saying, “Alright then. Since you’re set on it, this City Lord will not attempt to persuade you any further. The second choice is much simpler. Withstand a single move of mine without dodging. As long as you don’t die, I shall allow you to leave!”</p>
<p>“Withstand a single move without dodging!” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. Contrarily, Ma Xin Yuan and the rest were overjoyed to hear that.</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu was already at the peak of Third Order Origin Returning Realm, his strength almost comparable to Qian Tong’s. If he personally attacked, even if it’s just a single move, the arrogant brat would most certainly be gravely injured, if not outright dead.</p>
<p>As they rejoiced, Ma Xin Yuan and the rest even thought that they had misinterpreted Fei Zhi Tu’s intentions. So he didn’t plan on letting the little brat leave unharmed. It was only because of the difference in status and cultivation that made it difficult for him to act directly, but now that Yang Kai chose this himself, there was no more contention to be had. They looked towards Yang Kai in glee, waiting for the show to start.</p>
<p>“Chicken?” Fei Zhi Tu looked towards Yang Kai in mockery.</p>
<p>“Why would I be?” Yang Kai’s eyes were shining with anticipation. A Third Order Origin Returning Realm was too great an opponent for him right now, but a single move shouldn’t be too much to withstand. Even if he were to be hurt, it wouldn’t take long for him to recover with his current restorative abilities.</p>
<p>This was the perfect chance to test the difference between himself and a cultivator of that level.</p>
<p>On the Shadowed Star, the peak of Third Order Origin Returning Realm was the highest cultivation. If he could leave unscathed after a clash against Fei Zhi Tu, then he could re-evaluate his own strength.</p>
<p>“Little brat, you’ve got balls!” Fei Zhi Tu’s previously amiable expression suddenly grew fierce. He exclaimed, “I hope you don’t regret your choice!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai remained silent, a look of focus on his face. With a wave of his hand, the Firebird hovering above his head let out a shriek and morphed into a ball of flames, shrouding his body completely in what looked like flowing magma, causing the space around him to bend.</p>
<p>Yang Kai then summoned his Purple Shield and poured his Saint Qi into it. The sandstorm formed around him immediately, concealing his figure within.</p>
<p>The next moment, a shield formed of pitch-black flames appeared before Yang Kai. This was the Grand Heavenly Shield formed from his own Saint Qi!</p>
<p>No sooner were the three layers of defence put up before a frightening pulse of Saint Qi radiated out from Fei Zhi Tu’s direction. He took a step forward and, without anyone being able to see what happened clearly, appeared directly around thirty metres away from Yang Kai.</p>
<p>The roar of a tiger rang out from within his body, and a gigantic tiger head began to form right above his body. At first, it looked to be a mere illusion, but as Fei Zhi Tu started injecting his Saint Qi into it, it became more and more solid.</p>
<p>At the same time, an unparalleled aura of savagery spread out from the tiger head.</p>
<p>The onlookers turned pale and backed away hurriedly. Although Fei Zhi Tu was not directing the attack towards them, the waves of murderous intent spreading out from the tiger head felt like wind blades cutting into their skin, chilling them to the bone.</p>
<p>The City Lord was serious! Everyone watched on in joy.</p>
<p>“Be careful, little brat!” Fei Zhi Tu exclaimed as the tiger head floating above his own suddenly opened its mouth and pounced towards Yang Kai with immense force, much like a real tiger pouncing on its prey.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression was grave as he mobilised his Saint Qi with all his might.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the tiger head came into contact with the Grand Heavenly Shield set up in the outermost layer. A series of loud cracking sounds rang out as the tiger head tore through several dozen layers of the Grand Heavenly Shield like they were paper mache as it headed unimpeded towards the second layer of sandstorm.</p>
<p>The enormous power of the sandstorm was generated by the force hidden within the Purple Shield. As the tiger head plunged into it, it slowed all of a sudden, and even seemed to show signs of stopping.</p>
<p>However, Yang Kai was shocked rather than elated at this, and his expression grew even graver.</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu laughed coldly. Activating his Divine Sense, the tiger head suddenly shot out a beam of dark light from its mouth, which exploded as soon as it appeared, tearing a gap in the sandstorm. Taking this opportunity, the tiger head pushed forward, and the sandstorm could do nothing to stop it.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the gigantic tiger head had advanced all the way to Yang Kai, opening its mouth and biting downwards at Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai didn’t dare be careless, and he immediately willed the defensive barrier which the Artifact Spirit Firebird had morphed into to start rotating, causing it to appear as if his whole body was being set ablaze, radiating an intense heat outwards.</p>
<p>The roars of the tiger and shrieks of the bird were unceasing.</p>
<p>Ma Xin Yuan and the rest craned their necks in hopes of seeing if Yang Kai was already gravely injured or dead, but their sights were completely obstructed by the sandstorm, and they could only wait anxiously for the result.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a few people were able to infer from Fei Zhi Tu’s expression that Yang Kai wasn’t suffering any immediate dangers.</p>
<p>With a fwoosh, the sandstorm suddenly dispersed, converging once again into a shining Purple Shield as it flew aside. At the same time, Yang Kai’s figure backed away from within, his face pale. The Artifact Spirit Firebird which had been shrouding him had already disengaged and was now hovering once again above his head. While the colour of the tiger head had dimmed significantly, it was still chasing after Yang Kai, looking like it was still going for the kill.</p>
<p>Midair, Yang Kai’s expression grew fierce, and with a wave of both of his hands, several pitch-black Space Blades slashed out, heading towards the tiger head.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Fei Zhi Tu furrowed his brows, then shouted as realisation dawned on him, “Stop!”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he had already repositioned himself in front of the tiger head, absorbing it back into his body with a wave of one hand while the other summoned out the Blue Jade Bowl. A beam of blinding blue light shot out and headed towards the Space Blades.</p>
<p>Chi chi chi...</p>
<p>The blue light instantly dimmed, causing Fei Zhi Tu to show a pained expression.</p>
<p>The Blue Jade Bowl was a long-time artifact of his, and one of which he relied upon most. The blue light stored in it harboured some strange qualities, and had been able to save him many times in fights against enemies. However, just now, he clearly felt that some of that light had disappeared, and he couldn’t even tell exactly where to.</p>
<p>Possibly because of those mysterious blades giving out the pulse of Space Force, he realised as his pained expression grew.</p>
<p>The blue light that he had lost would take years for him to replenish, and he would even have to sacrifice some precious treasures for that purpose.</p>
<p>At this point in time, he was having serious thoughts about killing Yang Kai. He had not suffered such a loss even against opponents of the same cultivation, not to mention a mere Saint King Realm.</p>
<p>By the time Fei Zhi Tu summoned the Blue Jade Bowl, Yang Kai had already stopped his attacks, retreating to his shield and reclaiming it. He took a few deep breaths, finally restoring some colour to his pale face. Only after all this did he look towards Fei Zhi Tu with a slightly strange expression on his face.</p>
<p>“You...” Fei Zhi Tu looked at his Blue Jade Bowl, then at Yang Kai, his expression twisted to the extreme.</p>
<p>Yang Kai merely chuckled, “Senior, that’s the second move.”</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu froze, laughed bitterly, took a long look at Yang Kai, then finally waved his hand in exasperation, “Go on, get out. Don’t ever step foot within Heavenly Fate City ever again, or I will make you regret it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for showing mercy, Senior. Um, if possible, I would like to ask Senior to return the ball of fire you absorbed earlier!” Yang Kai stared at the Blue Jade Bowl in his hands.</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu’s face twitched. He then sent a strand of Saint Qi into the Blue Jade Bowl, and a ball of fire flew out at once. The Artifact Spirit Firebird opened its mouth and sucked the fire in, hovering one last round before disappearing into Yang Kai’s body.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Fei Zhi Tu was being extremely nice, just that he felt that something was off with the ball of fire that had been absorbed. It wasn’t something he could refine and, if sealed within the Blue Jade Bowl for too long, could not only affect the artifact’s power but also cause damage to it. Compared to that, he was more willing to do Yang Kai a favour.</p>
<p>“Goodbye!” Yang Kai cupped his fists. He took one last long look at Ma Xin Yuan and the rest, as if trying to commit their faces to memory, and let out a cold laugh before summoning his Star Shuttle and heading off towards the direction of Dragon Cave Mountain.</p>
<h2>1333</h2>
<p>Ad</p>
<p>Chapter 1333, Late Night Meeting</p>
<p>Among the ruins of Heavenly Fate City, Ma Xin Yuan and others stood silently, their faces sombre and the atmosphere dignified.</p>
<p>They had not expected Yang Kai to really be able to resist one move from Fei Zhi Tu and then retreat safely.</p>
<p>All of them had witnessed the power behind that move and understood that Fei Zhi Tu had not just been putting on a show. None of the Origin Realm masters present were confident they could have successfully blocked that move, yet a mere Third-Order Saint King Realm youth had.</p>
<p>While Ma Xin Yuan and the others felt shocked, a fear of Yang Kai swept over them. This boy was just a Third-Order Saint King yet already possessed such strength, so what would happen if he were to break through to the Origin Returning Realm?</p>
<p>Everyone on the scene was an old fox, so naturally they understood the truth of strangling danger in its cradle, and after witnessing Yang Kai’s cold gaze before he left, none of them doubted he would seek revenge for this when he rose up in the future.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a moment, Ma Xin Yuan cupped his fists and haltingly asked, “Sir City Lord, are you really going to just let him go?”</p>
<p>“If I don’t let him go, what do you want me to do?” Fei Zhi Tu had a stomach full of grievances but nowhere to vent, so he glared coldly the moment Ma Xin Yuan spoke up.</p>
<p>“But that little brat killed a member of the Xie Family...”</p>
<p>“Xie Family!” Fei Zhi Tu coldly snorted, “So what? Are you also a member of the Xie Family? What do the lives of the Xie Family have to do with me?”</p>
<p>Ma Xin Yuan lowered his head and did not dare say anything more.</p>
<p>“Hmph, if you don’t want to let him go, you can chase after him now, as long as you have the confidence to make him remain!”</p>
<p>“Sir City Lord surely jests,” The group of people all looked extremely embarrassed, none of them daring to mention Yang Kai again.</p>
<p>“Since you have no confidence in your own strength, just shut up and stay put! If anyone dares question this City Lord’s conduct again, do not blame this City Lord for not giving any face. In addition, do you really think that old fart Qian Tong really will not come back? Heh, you’d all best pray you’ve made the right choice today, otherwise, there may be no place for you in Shadow Moon Hall in the future.”</p>
<p>The group of people all glanced around at each other in dismay and were about to try to inquire more about the current situation when they saw Fei Zhi Tu flick his sleeve and fly off.</p>
<p>“Brother Ma, what should we do? Listening to what City Lord Fei said just now, there seems to be some twists and turns in the battle inside the Sect. Perhaps the rumours about Elder Qian aren’t...” Someone looked at Ma Xin Yuan and asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right! Brother Ma, didn’t you say this time’s matter was foolproof and wouldn’t have any repercussions? Why else would we all cooperate with the Xie Family against a Saint King Realm Junior if that wasn’t the case?” Someone else chimed in.</p>
<p>Ma Xin Yuan’s expression became ugly and impatient as he shouted, “If you ask this old master, who is this old master supposed to ask? This old master just listened to the people above and followed their instructions, how am I supposed to understand the specific situation? If you really want to know, go try asking Manager Xie and see what answer he can give you.”</p>
<p>“Manager Xie...” Listening to Ma Xin Yuan’s excuses, how could everyone here not know that this time they had been used as pawns? Feeling deeply regretful and remembering Qian Tong’s power and ability, all of them went pale, cupped their fists, and left quickly.</p>
<p>Back at Dragon Cave Mountain, Yang Kai returned with a pale face.</p>
<p>As soon as he entered the mountain, he saw Wu Yi, Yang Yan, Qian Yue, and the others standing there waiting for him. When the three women saw him appear, they all greeted him joyfully.</p>
<p>“Are you hurt?” Wu Yi saw Yang Kai’s complexion and could not help calling out in alarm.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. How are Yu Feng and the others doing?” Yang Kai waved his hand and asked.</p>
<p>“They’re busy healing, but it shouldn’t take long before they recover. If you had not returned just now, Foreign Elder Chang and Foreign Elder Hao would have rushed back to Heavenly Fate City.”</p>
<p>“En,” Yang Kai gently nodded, “Tell them there’s no need for that, this time’s matter will end here. Shadow Moon Hall shouldn’t engage in any kind of harassment anymore, but you should try not to go out during this time and be especially careful of the Xie Family. They might try to make a move.”</p>
<p>“Understood, I’ll make sure no one leaves unless absolutely necessary,” Wu Yi responded quickly before immediately saying with concern, “You also need to heal your wounds.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai nodded and walked towards his cave mansion.</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu deserved his reputation as a peak Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master. Although the move he made did not outwardly seem fancy or profound, only Yang Kai, who had taken it head-on, understood how fierce it was. Unfortunately, whether his opponent had used his full strength or not was something Yang Kai could not tell.</p>
<p>Needing only a single move to wound him, even without using full strength, it seemed the gap between Yang Kai and the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm was still too big.</p>
<p>Taking a few bottles of pills out from his ring, Yang Kai poured them out and began stuffing them into his mouth before closing his eyes and adjusting his breathing.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his injuries were not serious and only his aura was a bit unstable, so after half a day of meditation, Yang Kai had basically completely recovered. His Golden Blood’s restorative abilities were as astonishing as ever, so this minor injury was really nothing to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Releasing his Divine Sense and realizing that it was already late at night, Yang Kai’s expression became solemn as he quietly got up, opened the cave mansion’s barrier, and stealthily left Dragon Cave Mountain before flying straight to Heavenly Fate City.</p>
<p>Soon after, Yang Kai arrived at the city and, following the route in his memory, rushed towards the City Lord’s Mansion.</p>
<p>After another cup of tea worth of time, Yang Kai landed outside the City Lord’s Mansion, and although this was his first time here, under the investigation of his Divine Sense, he was quickly able to grasp the situation here.</p>
<p>Tonight, the City Lord’s Mansion seemed a little weird. There were no people around, not even the cultivators who would normally be responsible for patrolling and guarding the perimeter.</p>
<p>The City Lord’s Mansion’s staff did not know what was happening, only that tonight the City Lord himself had ordered that everyone was forbidden to move about the compound. Anyone found disobeying this decree would be killed without mercy!</p>
<p>Facing this kind of strict order, no one dared to violate the City Lord’s command.</p>
<p>Seemingly having anticipated this, Yang Kai simply walked right through the front entrance of the City Lord’s Mansion. After taking a few turns, he soon arrived at a certain side building inside the City Lord’s Mansion and, just as he stood firm, Fei Zhi Tu’s voice called out, “Since you’ve arrived, come in and sit down.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yang Kai smiled slightly and pushed the door openly.</p>
<p>Inside this building, Fei Zhi Tu sat on a chair and looked towards the door with a smile. After Yang Kai walked in, he waved his hand lightly, using his Saint Qi to close the door again.</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s expression remained unchanged as he walked directly to another chair across from Fei Zhi Tu and sat down calmly.</p>
<p>“Today I saw you were quite bold, but it seems I still underestimated your courage. Aren’t you afraid that after entering the tiger’s cave you won’t be able to easily leave?” Fei Zhi Tu sneered meaningfully.</p>
<p>“Senior need not joke, if you really wanted to deal with this Junior, there would be no need to go through all this trouble. Taking action directly would have sufficed,” Yang Kai replied lightly.</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu’s eyes flashed brightly, and he nodded, “Good, it seems that old fart Qian Tong didn’t misread you, a truly impressive youth!”</p>
<p>“May I ask why Senior Fei silently sent this Junior a message earlier today, asking me to come here at this time?” Yang Kai asked in a solemn tone.</p>
<p>During the day, when he fought with Fei Zhi Tu, the other party had suddenly sent him a Divine Sense Message asking him to come to the City Lord’s Mansion at night, a development that puzzled Yang Kai greatly. Although he did not know the reason, he could guess that it was related somehow to the recent changes in Shadow Moon Hall.</p>
<p>“If I said I want to ask you for your help, would you believe me?”</p>
<p>“My help?” Yang Kai frowned, “What kind of help?”</p>
<p>“Let’s set that aside for the moment. Let me first ask you, what do you think of Shadow Moon Hall’s current situation?” Fei Zhi Tu lowered his voice and asked solemnly.</p>
<p>Yang Kai slowly shook his head, “Junior has recently been in retreat on Dragon Cave Mountain, so he isn’t aware of what has been happening outside. I hope Senior can enlighten me.”</p>
<p>“So, that’s how it is!” Fei Zhi Tu gently nodded, “In that case, this City Lord won’t beat around the bush. The reason your Dragon Cave Mountain was targeted this time is actually because of the infighting going on inside Shadow Moon Hall. Regarding this, my Shadow Moon Hall has utterly wronged you; after all, you have been happily cooperating with us over the past few years and our relationship has brought great benefits to both parties. However, your Dragon Cave Mountain still being able to remain safe and steady is mainly because of that old fart Qian Tong sheltering you. Now though, Qian Tong has encountered a little trouble and some people want to take this opportunity to deal with him. They used your grievance with the Xie Family as an excuse to act against your Dragon Cave Mountain so they could test Qian Tong’s reaction.”</p>
<p>Having said this much, Fei Zhi Tu stared at Yang Kai for a moment but to his surprise he did not see any change in expression on this youth’s face, prompting him to ask, “You already knew?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai simply chuckled, “I had my speculations.”</p>
<p>“Fierce!” Fei Zhi Tu’s eyes flashed with approval, “Since you’ve already guessed that much, the rest is easier to explain. In short, Shadow Moon Hall is currently divided into two camps, one headed by Qian Tong, the other by an Elder named Feng Zhen. These two have different ideas and employ different methods, causing conflict between them inside the Sect. Moreover, these two respectively oversee the Sect’s Artifact Refining and Alchemy divisions with the other Elders and Deacons fairly evenly distributed among them. These two factions have been struggling with one another for many years, but no major incidents had taken place until recently a big event broke the balance between them.”</p>
<p>“Grandmaster Ge Lin’s death?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes as he recalled this matter. Qian Tong and Grandmaster Ge Lin had a particularly good personal relationship, so when Grandmaster Ge Lin passed away, it was equivalent to Qian Tong losing one of his greatest supporters, inevitably causing the other faction to have some ideas.</p>
<p>Yang Kai thought his guess was correct, but Fei Zhi Tu sneered and shook his head, “Grandmaster Ge Lin’s death was indeed part of the reason, but the real cause of this falling out was something else.”</p>
<p>“Something else?” Yang Kai asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Speaking of this matter, you were also involved in it,” Fei Zhi Tu whispered, “The Red Candle Fruit piece!”</p>
<p>“That?!” Yang Kai suddenly realized.</p>
<p>“In Shadow Moon Hall, the Sect Master isn’t actually the strongest. The most powerful ones are that old fart Qian Tong and Feng Zhen. Both of them have the highest chance to break through to the Origin King Realm, but there is only a small piece of the Red Candle Fruit and everyone wants it. Surely you can imagine how the situation developed from there, right? “</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, it certainly could explain the current situation,” Yang Kai’s expression flashed a look of understanding.</p>
<p>Two years ago, when the Flowing Flame Sand Field opened, a Red Candle Fruit had appeared in the third layer, and although it had ultimately been cut into several pieces by Leng Qing of Star Emperor Mountain, Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er managed to snatch one of those pieces and successfully bring it back to Shadow Moon Hall. This treasure was rumoured to be able to allow an Origin Returning Realm master to break through to the Origin King Realm. This kind of temptation was far too great, so it was not surprising that the original balance between Shadow Moon Hall’s factions was broken by its appearance.</p>

<p>Chapter 1334, Qian Tong Is Stranded</p>

<p>“Heh, in truth, that old fart Qian Tong isn’t the type of person who likes fighting with others, but the significance of that Red Candle Fruit piece is just too great. If it could really promote him to the Origin King Realm, then my Shadow Moon Hall would become the first Sect on Shadowed Star. Not even Star Emperor Mountain would be a match for my Shadow Moon Hall, so although this hope is slim, in the end, it is still hope. Old Qian knows this and Feng Zhen naturally knows it as well, so the hostility that had been just below the surface finally broke out. The internal workings of Shadow Moon Hall can now only be described as a chaotic mess,” Fei Zhi Tu said with some sadness, “If this matter isn’t handled well, at best my Shadow Moon Hall will suffer a sharp decline, and at worst it will completely collapse!”</p>
<p>“Are things really so serious?” Yang Kai’s face changed slightly.</p>
<p>“The grievances between the Elders and Deacons of the two factions that Qian Tong and Feng Zhen lead have been piling up for many years. Until now, they had been suppressed by the Sect Master so no big trouble ever erupted, but this time, the Sect Master is truly helpless. In fact, if not for Sect Master being so old, this Red Candle Fruit piece would have been taken by him and that would have been the end of it, but Sect Master couldn’t bear to waste such a Heaven defying treasure, so he refused to use it. If this dispute inside the Shadow Moon Hall really turns into an all-out conflict, heh, little brat, you understand what it means to be an egg in a quarrelling nest?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes twitched; how could he not understand what Fei Zhi Tu wanted to say? If Shadow Moon Hall really fell apart, then Dragon Cave Mountain would also suffer disaster; after all, Dragon Cave Mountain was still within the core territory of Shadow Moon Hall, so what would happen to them if a war broke out was impossible to say.</p>
<p>But soon, Yang Kai’s expression became flat as he stared at Fei Zhi Tu and asked, “Senior need not spin such a terrifying tale, this Junior just wants to know now, which faction do you belong to?”</p>
<p>“Me?” Fei Zhi Tu raised his brow, laughing wryly a moment later as he slowly said, “This City Lord had grown tired of those people’s infighting, so I asked the Sect Master to assign me the duty of overseeing Heavenly Fate City. As the master of this city, which faction do you believe I belong to?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently nodded and said with a smile, “From Senior’s words just now and the concern you showed about Elder Qian, I thought for sure you were a member of Elder Qian’s faction.”</p>
<p>“Bullshit! Qian Tong that old fart...” Fei Zhi Tu coldly snorted, seemingly wanting to continue cursing, but halfway through he swallowed his words and waved his hand in annoyance, “Forget it. Long story short, I owe Qian Tong a big favour, so this time I plan on paying it back in full!”</p>
<p>“What does this matter have to do with me?” Yang Kai frowned, “For what reason did Senior call Junior out here so late at night?”</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu stared at Yang Kai with a solemn look and said, “Qian Tong ran into some trouble!”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“You don’t seem like an ungrateful person. Your Dragon Cave Mountain being able to develop steadily these past few years has much to do with Qian Tong’s care. Do not think he hasn’t looked after you. If not for him taking a commanding position here in Heavenly Fate City, your little home might have already been swallowed whole. A trivial few youngsters who don’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth actually occupying other people’s territory and lording over it? Hmph.”</p>
<p>“For the time being, let us not mention Dragon Cave Mountain. City Lord Fei, tell me about Elder Qian’s situation. If there is any place I can help with, I will certainly not refuse,” Yang Kai said lightly. There was no need to mention out loud things that Yang Kai was already well aware of. He knew that Dragon Cave Mountain remaining so calm and steady these past few years was indeed mainly thanks to Qian Tong’s shelter, but Fei Zhi Tu blatantly pointing out this fact was still uncomfortable to hear, causing his tone to become somewhat cold.</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu didn’t seem to mind either way and continued, “What I want to tell you next is something only a few people know. This matter is of great importance, so absolutely do not let it leak out.”</p>
<p>After receiving this urge, Yang Kai nodded in understanding.</p>
<p>Listening to Fei Zhi Tu’s explanation, Yang Kai realized that Qian Tong had been missing for nearly half a year. Calculating the time, Qian Tong had already been gone when Yang Kai and Yang Yan set out for Coloured Glass Sect.</p>
<p>As for where he went, there were many differing opinions. Some people said that he had entered a secluded retreat to comprehend some kind of profound Secret Technique. Others said he went out in search of some opportunity and encountered an unexpected accident. Others still said he did not wish to be the cause of Shadow Moon Hall’s collapse and had decided to go into exile.</p>
<p>However, no matter which hypothesis, no one was able to confirm anything.</p>
<p>At this moment, when Shadow Moon Hall was falling apart and fierce disputes were happening throughout the Sect, Qian Tong’s sudden disappearance was truly quite puzzling. It was precisely because he had disappeared at such a critical juncture that Feng Zhen was becoming more and more daring. Now, in Shadow Moon Hall, although there were still several influential Elders who could join forces to suppress Feng Zhen, without a key person like Qian Tong to lead them, they had fallen into a disadvantage.</p>
<p>If Qian Tong failed to return soon, the consequences would definitely be unimaginable.</p>
<p>This time, Ma Xin Yuan and several others joining forces with the Xie Family to deal with Dragon Cave Mountain was a final probe from Feng Zhen towards Qian Tong. Feng Zhen wanted to see if, when he took this opportunity to deal with Dragon Cave Mountain it would force Qian Tong to appear. Although the result of this probe was the death of an Origin Returning Realm master from the Xie Family, it should still be able to satisfy Feng Zhen’s faction.</p>
<p>Qian Tong not showing up from beginning to end was enough to prove that something had gone wrong.</p>
<p>As soon as the outcome of this probe was passed back to the Sect, it was almost certain that Feng Zhen’s faction would begin making a big move.</p>
<p>“Where is Elder Qian now?” Yang Kai asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“An Ancient Ruin!” Fei Zhi Tu replied in a low voice.</p>
<p>“An Ancient Ruin?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“Yes, but whether he’s alive or dead, I don’t know,” Fei Zhi Tu sighed, “The last time I received news from him was half a month ago. At that time, he used this thing to pass me a message.”</p>
<p>Saying this, Fei Zhi Tu flicked his wrist and a small white light suddenly appeared at his fingertips and flew directly to Yang Kai.</p>
<p>Yang Kai reached out and directly grabbed the white light, holding it in his palm as he observed it. To his surprise though, this white light turned out to be a kind of insect similar to a snow-white silkworm. It was only a couple centimetres long and through its pure white exterior one could make out some tiny blood vessels.</p>
<p>However, when Yang Kai swept this strange insect with his Divine Sense, a message suddenly sounded in his mind.</p>
<p>Yang Kai was startled but quickly calmed down and listened quietly.</p>
<p>The message this insect relayed was indeed left by Qian Tong, and by listening to it, Yang Kai immediately understood the other party’s situation.</p>
<p>It was just as Fei Zhi Tu had said, Qian Tong was stranded in an Ancient Ruin and could not get out of it. He had been forced to let this insect come to Heavenly Fate City with his distress message to ask Fei Zhi Tu for help.</p>
<p>“This insect is called a Messenger Insect. It is an Exotic Ancient Insect whose only use is delivering messages. However, because it can ignore all forms of barriers and arrays, it is quite convenient to use. Don’t be fooled by its bloated appearance either, it’s quite fast,” Fei Zhi Tu explained after Yang Kai finished his investigation.</p>
<p>Yang Kai gently nodded, and a dignified look flashed across his face as he returned the Messenger Insect to Fei Zhi Tu.</p>
<p>Judging from what he heard just now, Qian Tong’s situation was not optimistic. The message left in this Messenger Insect seemed to have been recorded after Qian Ton had suffered injury, so after so long it was impossible to know what state he was in.</p>
<p>“City Lord Fei, might I ask why Elder Qian would choose such a critical moment to go explore an Ancient Ruin?” Yang Kai asked in confusion.</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu coldly snorted, “How should I know what he’s thinking?”</p>
<p>After a pause though, he continued, “If I had to guess, he didn’t want Shadow Moon Hall’s conflict to erupt into a full blown civil war, so he was looking for a way to balance the two factions’ power again in order to stabilize the current situation. You should know that he had a close personal relationship with Grandmaster Ge Lin before. En, with the prestige and contacts of Grandmaster Ge Lin, it was previously possible to completely suppress Feng Zhen’s faction, but now that Grandmaster Ge Lin has passed away, while the other side still has an Origin Grade Alchemist supporting them, the delicate balance has naturally disappeared. The Ancient Ruin Old Qian went to explore was something Grandmaster Ge Lin had discovered, and the reason Grandmaster Ge Lin was able to become an Origin Grade Artifact Refiner was also thanks to that ruin. Qian Tong going to search this Ancient Ruin this time was his desperate attempt to allow another person to break through their bottleneck and reach the level of Origin Grade Artifact Refiner. Once another Origin Grade Artifact Refiner emerges, the initiative for this situation would fall back into Qian Tong’s hands. Right, I forget to tell you, Qian Tong did not go out alone, he brought with him another person, a Saint King Grade Artifact Refiner who can be regarded as Grandmaster Ge Lin’s successor.”</p>
<p>“Then Elder Qian’s actions were well thought out,” Yang Kai could not help saying with a hint of admiration.</p>
<p>“Well thought out?” Fei Zhi Tu sneered disdainfully, “I think he was just trying to avoid the issue. Originally, with his means and connections, as long as he could harden his heart, even without Grandmaster Ge Lin’s presence he could definitely make Feng Zhen beg for death, but instead, that old fart chose to go around the sun to reach the moon. Why bother with those damned Ancient Ruins? Why not just solve the problem once and for all?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai grinned meaningfully, “It seems City Lord Fei and Elder Qian have a very good relationship.”</p>
<p>“The relationship between this City Lord and that old fart has no need for your comments!” Fei Zhi Tu’s face went cold, “I called you this time because I want your help fishing Qian Tong out from those Ancient Ruins, lest he really dies inside.”</p>
<p>“How this Junior can assist in this matter, I hope City Lord Fei can make clear. If those Ancient Ruins can trap Qian Tong, with my negligible cultivation, if I were to run over and explore them, what difference with seeking death would there be?”</p>
<p>“You’re certainly cautious enough, but this City Lord will make his point clear, lest you not be able to feel at ease. What I am interested in is not your personal strength. You are indeed extraordinary, a Third-Order Saint King being able to socialize with so many Origin Returning Realm masters, and even receive a move from me is quite extraordinary. Even if you relied on external forces like that shield artifact and your Artifact Spirit, your skills cannot be discounted. But if you were to enter that Ancient Ruin with only this kind of strength, you would only be a burden... however, your Artifact Spirit is a different matter. I want to borrow its power.”</p>
<p>Yang Kai curled his lips, realizing that Fei Zhi Tu’s purpose in calling him out here late at night was because he had his eyes on the Artifact Spirit.</p>
<p>“There is an ice road inside that Ancient Ruin which is extremely dangerous. Your Artifact Spirit’s flames are also not ordinary; even my Blue Jade Bowl was unable to refine and disperse them. If this City Lord can have your Artifact Spirit’s assistance, it will be much easier to pass through that ice road.”</p>

<p>Chapter 1335, You Actually Want Benefits?</p>
<p>Translator: Silavin &amp; PewPewLaserGun</p>
<p>Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain &amp; Dhael Ligerkeys</p>
<p>“Is that all?” Yang Kai asked in surprise after he finished listening.</p>
<p>“That’s all!” Fei Zhi Tu nodded slowly, “After crossing that ice road, whether breaking any kind barriers or rescuing Qian Tong, you don’t need to worry about it, this City Lord will make appropriate arrangements. If not for being unable to find an appropriate Fire Attribute artifact to restrain the chill of that ice road, I wouldn’t have delayed for so long. “</p>
<p>Yang Kai stroked his chin silently.</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu did not urge him further, allowing Yang Kai time to think things over. This was a matter of great importance, and although Fei Zhi Tu said he only wanted to use the power of Yang Kai’s Artifact Spirit to safely cross the ice road, it would still require entering an Ancient Ruin, so saying that there would be no risks was impossible. Even a master like Qian Tong had become trapped in that place, so Fei Zhi Tu could not make any guarantees.</p>
<p>This was a life or death risk, so of course, Yang Kai would need to think about it.</p>
<p>However, Fei Zhi Tu was confident Yang Kai would agree. As Heavenly Fate City’s City Lord, Fei Zhi Tu knew much about the nearby Dragon Cave Mountain and had heard enough rumours about Yang Kai to know he wasn’t an ungrateful villain.</p>
<p>Sure enough, after a while, Yang Kai raised his head and a steady look flashed across his eyes, obviously having made a decision. Noticing this, Fei Zhi Tu immediately stared at him.</p>
<p>“City Lord Fei, my Dragon Cave Mountain truly owes Elder Qian a great graciousness, so now that he has encountered trouble this Junior will naturally try his best to help!”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Fei Zhi Tu gently nodded, a trace of satisfaction appearing on his face as he secretly thought this youth had a praiseworthy sense of character.</p>
<p>But in the next instant, Yang Kai grinned and asked, “But what benefits are there in this for me?”</p>
<p>“Benefits?” Fei Zhi Tu was dumbfounded as he gawked towards Yang Kai and asked, “You actually want benefits?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai smiled as he said, “Isn’t City Lord Fei underestimating Junior too much? Junior has already passed the age where he acts hot-blooded and reckless with no regard for the future. City Lord Fei doesn’t think I will agree to help after only hearing a few words, right? Since I must take on risks, naturally I want to obtain some benefits!”</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu frowned as a trace of disappointment flashed across his face, coldly saying, “But this is about rescuing Qian Tong, not some random stranger!”</p>
<p>“And so? If Elder Qian had sent me a message personally, of course, Junior would have done his utmost without asking for compensation, but the one asking for my help now is Senior Fei. Junior is not familiar with you, so naturally, I should be asking you for benefits; after all, if we successfully rescue Elder Qian, the one Elder Qian will owe a favour to is you. It will have little to do with this Junior.”</p>
<p>“What kind of sophistry is that!?” Fei Zhi Tu’s face went blue as he shouted. Never had he imagined that Yang Kai would bluntly ask him for benefits. This was completely different from what he had envisioned. In Fei Zhi Tu’s opinion, his inviting Yang Kai was already giving this youth a great amount of face. If the other party didn’t possess that Fire Attribute Artifact Spirit, with his Third-Order Saint King Realm cultivation, he would simply not be eligible to participate in this action, and when the time really came, how could Qian Tong not show this kid any gratitude?</p>
<p>[This little brat is too shameless!] Fei Zhi Tu snorted angrily.</p>
<p>“Whether or not my words are sophistry, City Lord Fei should be able to judge himself,” Yang Kai replied calmly, not showing any signs of impatience.</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu glared at him for a long time, but suddenly remembering something, he wore a cunning grin and said, “If you want benefits, then I will give you benefits! Boy, you killed Xie Hong Wen of the Xie Family, right?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s face changed slightly but he quickly said, “City Lord Fei, food can be eaten freely, but words may not be spoken randomly. What evidence do you have to prove that I killed Xie Hong Wen?”</p>
<p>“Don’t try to play dumb with me!” Fei Zhi Tu coldly snorted, “Do you think other people don’t know about what you’ve done?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai frowned, feeling that the other party really was not just making baseless accusations. Quickly wearing a humble appearance, he asked, “Please enlighten me, Senior.”</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu smiled deviously and said, “Your grievances with Xie Hong Wen were known by many people, and when the Flowing Flame Sand Field opened, Xie Hong Wen deliberately brought two Xie Family Saint King Realm disciples with him just to seek revenge on you. However, when the Flowing Flame Sand field closed, none of them appeared again, so clearly they had died in the Flowing Flame Sand Field!”</p>
<p>“The Flowing Flame Sand Field is filled with danger. Even if he did die inside, what does that have to do with me?” Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent as he continued to deny the charge.</p>
<p>“Shadow Moon Hall has a rather special Secret Technique which can be applied to a Junior by their Elders. When a Junior falls, this Secret Technique will transfer itself to the one who killed them automatically. Not only does Xie Hong Wen have this Secret Technique placed on him, Wei Gu Chang, Dong Xuan’er and all the other elite disciples of the Sect do as well. I assume this City Lord doesn’t need to explain any further, yes?”</p>
<p>Yang Kai’s flashed an amazed expression. If Fei Zhi Tu was not lying to him, he must have been marked by that Secret Technique, and if that was the case, his killing Xie Hong Wen was probably not a secret.</p>
<p>“The Xie Family hadn’t taken action against you for two reasons, firstly because they feared Qian Tong and secondly because you rarely appeared after returning from the Flowing Flame Sand Field. The barriers and arrays protecting Dragon Cave Mountain are extremely powerful, so the Xie Family masters were unable to detect whether that Secret Technique had been transferred to you, but you leaving Dragon Cave Mountain just once was enough to confirm you killed Xie Hong Wen,” Fei Zhi Tu grinned meaningfully, “As long as you can accompany this City Lord on this trip, not only can I help you to disperse that stubborn Secret Technique, I can also promise you that in the future the Xie Family will never trouble your Dragon Cave Mountain again. I can even restore your previous trade relationship with Shadow Moon Hall, so are these benefits enough?”</p>
<p>While he was talking, Yang Kai had already used his Divine Sense to carefully examine his body, a moment later his expression turned extremely ugly.</p>
<p>In his body, Yang Kai discovered an extremely well concealed foreign energy mark. This mark’s energy fluctuations were very weak and if not for him meticulously scanning every inch of his body, Yang Kai would not have noticed it. Even with Fei Zhi Tu revealing this, Yang Kai had to check himself three times before he was able to discover the existence of this mark.</p>
<p>It seemed that this Shadow Moon Hall Secret Technique was truly covert.</p>
<p>“You found it?” Fei Zhi Tu looked at him in surprise. Although Yang Kai did not say anything, from the change in his expression, this point was fairly easy to determine.</p>
<p>This Secret Technique was extremely stealthy, and as far as Fei Zhi Tu knew, the mark which was applied to Xie Hong Wen was planted by Xie Li. Xie Li was a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, but even a master with equivalent strength may not have been able to find a trace of it, so how had this Third-Order Saint King youth done so?</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu could not help admiring Yang Kai while secretly wondering if he had used some kind of powerful artifact to help him find this mark.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not answer his question and instead tried to wrap this weak energy mark with his Demonic Flames to dissolve it. However, he soon found that although this mark’s energy fluctuations were extremely weak, they were also extremely difficult to refine. From the looks of it, it would take at least a few days to eliminate this mark.</p>
<p>Now that he had found it though, Yang Kai wasn’t in a hurry to remove it and pondered for a moment before turning to Fei Zhi Tu with a solemn expression, “I can agree with half of Senior’s proposal!”</p>
<p>“Half?”</p>
<p>“En, after this matter is completed, Dragon Cave Mountain’s trade relationship with Shadow Moon Hall can be restored, but the price of goods will need to be discussed again. As for Xie Family... heh, this Junior only has one request.”</p>
<p>“Let’s hear it!” Fei Zhi Tu narrowed his eyes at him.</p>
<p>“Shadow Moon Hall must not interfere with my and the Xie Family’s grievances!” Yang Kai declared.</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu raised his brow in astonishment. He had thought that Yang Kai was going to ask Shadow Moon Hall to suppress the Xie Family and not allow them to seek trouble with Dragon Cave Mountain in the future, how could he have known that this little brat’s courage would be so great. From the request Yang Kai made, it was obvious he wanted to personally and permanently settle things with Xie Family!</p>
<p>After understanding this point, Fei Zhi Tu suddenly became interested.</p>
<p>Although the Xie Family wasn’t a top-level family, it still had many Origin Returning Realm masters with its Patriarch being a genuine Second-Order Origin Realm master. With the strength of Dragon Cave Mountain today, could it really compete with a force like this? Was this boy simply sleep-talking?</p>
<p>Fei Zhi Tu didn’t want to interfere in the grievances between Yang Kai and Xie Family in the first place, and he was completely disinterested in what kind of bear hearts and leopard galls this boy had eaten to dare run his mouth like this, so he immediately nodded, “Sounds reasonable. As long as Qian Tong can return, I can guarantee that even if you destroy the Xie Family completely, Shadow Moon Hall will not raise any objections; of course, that will depend on if you have this ability.”</p>
<p>He was not very confident about Yang Kai’s chances.</p>
<p>Yang Kai did not bother arguing with him and instead began discussing the details of the operation. After agreeing on a date and place to meet, he got up and left the City Lord’s Mansion alone.</p>
<p>After Yang Kai left, Fei Zhi Tu frowned and muttered, “Wait, why didn’t that boy ask me to help him get rid of that Secret Technique mark? Does he have a way to remove it himself?”</p>
<p>Thinking about it for a while, Fei Zhi Tu slowly shook his head, too lazy to bother with it any further. The Xie Family already knew that Xie Hong Wen had died at Yang Kai’s hands, so it didn’t really matter if this mark was removed or not.</p>
<p>Yang Kai returned to Dragon Cave Mountain without alerting anyone.</p>
<p>The date he agreed on with Fei Zhi Tu was in three days’ time. Fei Zhi Tu apparently still had to make some preparations and he had to make sure to conceal his activities, otherwise, he might draw unwanted attention.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of these three days, Yang Kai planned to purge the weak mark from his body. Although from what Fei Zhi Tu had explained, this Secret Technique was only used to determine the killer of an elite disciple, who knows what other kinds of effects it could have?</p>
<p>Such a thing lingering inside his body made it impossible for Yang Kai to rest easy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Yang Kai’s Demonic Flames were quite extraordinary, incomparable to the Saint Qi of ordinary cultivators.</p>
<p>With the Artifact Spirit Firebird’s help, only two days later, Yang Kai managed to destroy the energy mark and, upon re-examining himself, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Next, Yang Kai summoned Chang Qi, Hao An, Yang Yan, Wu Yi, and Qian Yue, carefully telling them not to go out during this time, so as not to be targeted by the Xie Family’s people. After seeing everyone nod, Yang Kai returned to his cave mansion to make a few preparations.</p>
<p>In fact, there were no special preparations to make. Saint Crystals would ordinarily be a must, but in addition to what Yang Kai always carried with him, Yang Yan had given him many of the crystal spheres the Stone Puppet had compressed and refined. Whether it was in terms of quantity or total internal energy, these spheres were far superior to High-Rank Saint Crystals whether they were used for healing, restoring, or combat.</p>
<p>Yang Yan called these Saint Crystals spheres made by the Stone Puppet Saint Crystal Sources!</p>
